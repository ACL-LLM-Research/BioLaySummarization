    **Title:** Unveiling the Complex Organization of Electrical Synapses: A Study of Gap Junctions and Adherens Junctions in Zebrafish Mauthner Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular and structural organization of electrical synapses, specifically the relationship between gap junctions and adherens junctions, in identifiable single synaptic contacts on zebrafish Mauthner cells?

    **Methods:** We employed expansion microscopy to map the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures, including gap junctions, adherens junctions, and glutamate receptors, at single synaptic contacts on larval zebrafish Mauthner cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that most of the synaptic contact's surface is occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors are confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. We identified multiple gap junctions of variable size, each containing a variable number of channels, which mediate electrical transmission at zebrafish central excitatory (CE) synapses.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses, a modality of neuronal communication that has been understudied compared to chemical synapses. The relationship between gap junctions and adherens junctions at electrical synapses will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that electrical synapses operate with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses and highlight the need for further research into the functional diversity of electrical synapses in the nervous system.

    **Title:** Dissecting the Role of Pre-Bötzinger Complex Neurons in Respiratory and Orofacial Coordination

    **Research Question:** Do pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) neurons that project to the facial nucleus (7n) motoneurons play a crucial role in coordinating orofacial and respiratory activities?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to selectively photoinhibit preBötC neurons that project to 7n motoneurons in anesthetized and conscious mice. We used a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing Cre-recombinase-dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel, GtACR2, and another retrograde axonal delivery of Cre.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons that project to 7n motoneurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. This effect is altered by the type of anesthetic employed and between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons consists of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic activity regulation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our results support the hypothesis that preBötC neurons projecting to 7n motoneurons transmit respiratory rhythm, rather than generating it. Selective photoinhibition of these neurons modulates orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity. These findings have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying respiratory and orofacial coordination, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with abnormal respiratory and orofacial behaviors.

    **Title:** CGRP Neurons in the Parabrachial Nucleus Modulate Active Defensive Behaviors in Response to Aversive Stimuli

    **Research Question:** Do calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) play a critical role in modulating active defensive behaviors in response to aversive stimuli?

    **Methods:** We employed a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice to investigate the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic manipulations were used to examine the activity of CGRP neurons in response to varying levels of aversive stimuli.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, suggesting that CGRP neurons amplify the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning.

    **Implications:** These findings expand our understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception. Our results suggest that CGRP neurons play a key role in modulating adaptive defensive responses to varying levels of danger.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that CGRP neurons in the PBN are not only involved in passive freezing responses but also modulate active defensive behaviors in response to aversive stimuli. By amplifying the perceived threat, CGRP neurons ensure adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying defensive behaviors and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for anxiety disorders.

    **Title:** Obesity-Associated Changes in Human Brain Structure: A Diffusion-Weighted MRI Study of Isotropic Volume Fraction and Intra-Cellular Volume Fraction

    **Research Question:** This study investigates the relationship between obesity and human brain structure, specifically examining the association between waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF).

    **Methods:** Using diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 UK Biobank participants, we tested the hypothesis that WHR is associated with regional differences in ISOVF and ICVF. We identified two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF.

    **Main Findings:** We observed significant associations between WHR and both ISOVF and ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. In contrast, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density. We propose a two-way mechanistic model, where genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the relationship between obesity and human brain structure, highlighting the importance of considering both ISOVF and ICVF in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying obesity. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting obesity-related brain changes. Future studies should investigate the causal relationships between obesity, brain structure, and function to further elucidate the complex interplay between these factors.
Title: Identification of Disseminating Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Cancer Stem Cells in Human Oral Tumours Predicts Metastatic Disease

    Abstract:

    Background: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are thought to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, the relevance of EMT CSCs to human cancer remains uncertain due to the lack of direct evidence in human tumour specimens.

    Research Question: Can the combination of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin markers identify disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens and predict metastatic disease?

    Methods: We examined over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours using immunofluorescent staining for EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to predict metastasis based on the presence of EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma.

    Main Findings: We observed a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. The presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma was strongly correlated with tumour metastasis. The ANN predicted metastasis with high accuracy (cross-validated accuracy of 87-89%).

    Implications: Our study provides direct evidence of disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, which are highly predictive of metastatic disease. The combination of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin markers can be used to identify EMT CSCs in human tumours, enabling the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target these cells.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of EMT CSCs in human oral cancer and highlights the potential of image-based machine learning approaches to predict metastasis. The identification of disseminating EMT CSCs in human tumours has significant implications for the development of targeted therapies to prevent metastasis and improve patient outcomes.

    **Title:** Evolutionarily Conserved Mechanisms of Apoptotic Cell Clearance Regulate Tissue Repair in Mouse and Human Wounds

    **Research Question:** How do apoptotic cell recognition and clearance via efferocytosis regulate tissue repair in mouse and human wounds, particularly in diabetic patients?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds and human diabetic foot wounds. We also conducted functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds to elucidate the roles of efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in wound repair.

    **Main Findings:** Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are upregulated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Notably, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. In mouse wounds, we detected upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo revealed that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis, whereas inhibition of Timd4 decreased efferocytosis and abrogated wound repair.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provide potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. The upregulation of efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways in early skin wound beds and diabetic foot wounds suggests that efficient efferocytosis is crucial for clearing apoptotic cells during inflammation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive atlas of the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. The differential effects of Axl and Timd4 on efferocytosis and wound repair suggest that these receptors play distinct roles in regulating tissue repair. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.

    Title: Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (TaG-EM): A Novel Approach for Positive Identification of Cell Types in Single-Cell Sequencing Data

    Background: Single-cell sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying the cell types corresponding to gene expression clusters remains a significant challenge.

    Research Question: Can a genetic barcoding approach be developed to enable positive identification of cell types in single-cell sequencing data sets?

    Methods: We describe a novel genetic barcoding strategy, Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (TaG-EM), which leverages the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. TaG-EM involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, enabling the barcode sequence to be read out during single-cell sequencing.

    Main Findings: We demonstrate that TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we show that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements.

    Implications: TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. This approach provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms, enabling novel capabilities in several experimental contexts.

    Conclusions: TaG-EM represents a significant advancement in the field of single-cell sequencing, allowing for the positive identification of cell types and enabling the integration of anatomical information with transcriptomic data. The ability to read out TaG-EM barcodes using next-generation sequencing further expands the potential applications of this approach, including population-scale behavioral measurements. Overall, TaG-EM has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and gene expression within tissues.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Origins of Chemical Defense in Poison Frogs: A New Perspective on Alkaloid Accumulation

    **Research Question:** How do poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae acquire and accumulate alkaloids for chemical defense, and what are the evolutionary implications of this process?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive study of alkaloid accumulation in poison frogs, including species from both defended and undefended clades. We analyzed the diet of these frogs, focusing on their consumption of mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. We also incorporated ideas from pharmacokinetics to develop an evolutionary model explaining the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to previous studies, our data show that undefended poison frog species have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that these frogs regularly consume mites and ants, which are sources of alkaloids. Our results suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype, and we propose the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration: passive accumulation. This process involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms, yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of chemical defense in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. We propose that passive accumulation is an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae and possibly in related taxa, and that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense. Our findings have implications for understanding the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and the molecular processes governing the fate of ingested toxins.

    **Conclusions:** Our study challenges the prevailing view that diet is the primary determinant of defense in poison frogs. Instead, we suggest that passive accumulation of consumed alkaloids is a key intermediate stage on the path towards toxin sequestration. Our results highlight the need for further research on the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs, and we propose an evolutionary model that incorporates ideas from pharmacokinetics to explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals.

    **Title:** Targeting Ribosome Biogenesis as a Novel Strategy to Overcome Chemoresistance in Advanced Breast Cancer

    **Background:** Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process contributing to chemotherapy resistance in advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) in the EMT/MET process, and can targeting RiBi overcome chemoresistance in advanced breast cancer?

    **Methods:** We utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. We also employed a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit RiBi.

    **Main Findings:** Our findings revealed that RiBi is transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. Inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Moreover, combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies.

    **Implications:** Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer. The involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the role of RiBi in the EMT/MET process and highlights the potential of targeting RiBi as a therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in advanced breast cancer. Our findings have significant implications for the development of new treatments for patients with advanced breast cancer.

    **Title:** Seedling Root Traits Impact Plant Establishment under Challenging Environments: Unveiling the Role of Glutaredoxin-encoding Gene PgGRXC9 in Pearl Millet

    **Research Question:** How do seedling root traits influence plant establishment in challenging environments, and what genetic mechanisms underlie this adaptation in pearl millet, a heat and drought-tolerant cereal crop?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of crop modeling, genome-wide association study (GWAS), quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, and functional characterization of a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9, to investigate the relationship between seedling root traits and drought tolerance in pearl millet.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that early drought stress is a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems, affecting crops during the vegetative stage. We demonstrate that increased primary root growth in pearl millet is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions. Genome-wide association study and QTL analysis identified a genomic region controlling primary root growth, which was further narrowed down to a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog, AtROXY19, revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin gene clade in regulating cell elongation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the fast-growing primary root in pearl millet is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate, enabling the crop to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination. The identification of PgGRXC9 as a key regulator of root growth provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in pearl millet.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of seedling root traits in plant establishment under challenging environments and identifies a conserved function for glutaredoxin genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience to drought stress in pearl millet. The discovery of PgGRXC9 as a key regulator of root growth opens up new avenues for breeding and genetic improvement of drought-tolerant crops, particularly in the sub-Saharan Sahel region where pearl millet is a vital food source.

    **Title:** Dynamic Encoding of Concrete and Abstract Concepts in the Brain: The Role of Multimodal Context

    **Research Question:** How do concrete and abstract concepts encode in the brain during real-world processing, and to what extent do brain responses change depending on visual context?

    **Methods:** In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural representation of concrete and abstract concepts in the brain while participants watched movies. We analyzed the brain activation patterns in response to concrete and abstract words in different visual contexts.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organization is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. Our results highlight the role of visual context in modulating the neural representation of abstract and concrete words, and suggest that similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the dynamic encoding of concrete and abstract concepts in the brain during real-world processing. The findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain integrates information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations, a process critical for navigating the multimodal nature of real-world experiences. These results also suggest that the neural representation of concepts is not fixed, but rather changes dynamically depending on the context in which they are processed. Further research is needed to explore the extent to which these findings generalize to other contexts and sensory modalities.

    **Title:** Targeting Nonsense-Mediated Decay to Enhance Antigen Presentation in Cancer Cells

    **Research Question:** Can the inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a cellular pathway that conceals neoantigens through the destruction of RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations, be exploited to increase the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides on the surface of cancer cells?

    **Methods:** We developed a high-throughput screen based on ratiometric analysis of transcripts to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. We then designed and synthesized a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, and evaluated its effects on NMD in vitro and in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that KVS0001 inhibits NMD by disrupting SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1, leading to the elevation of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations. Importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increases the presentation of HLA class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells.

    **Implications:** The inhibition of NMD by KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. By increasing the presentation of neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells, KVS0001 may enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of targeting NMD to enhance antigen presentation in cancer cells. The development of KVS0001, a specific and soluble SMG1 inhibitor, represents a significant advancement in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Further studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of KVS0001 in cancer treatment.

    **Title:** Phenotypic Age Acceleration as a Novel Biomarker for Cancer Risk Prediction

    **Research Question:** Does Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge) Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) predict site-specific and overall cancer risk in individuals with varying genetic risk profiles?

    **Methods:** We analyzed data from 374,463 participants in the UK Biobank, using Cox regression models to examine the association between PhenoAgeAccel and cancer incidence by genetic risk group. We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and PhenoAgeAccel by subtracting the effect of chronological age. We also calculated an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PhenoAgeAccel is positively associated with overall cancer risk, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women, compared to biologically younger participants. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge. PhenoAgeAccel was also negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors (β = -1.01 in men, p < 0.001; β = -0.98 in women, p < 0.001).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that PhenoAgeAccel is a novel biomarker for cancer risk prediction, and that adherence to a healthy lifestyle can retard the aging process and reduce cancer risk. The association between PhenoAgeAccel and cancer risk was observed within and across genetic risk groups, indicating that PhenoAgeAccel can be used as a cost-effective indicator for measuring biological age and predicting cancer risk.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the utility of PhenoAgeAccel as a biomarker for cancer risk prediction, and highlights the importance of considering biological age in addition to chronological age when assessing cancer risk. Our findings have implications for the development of personalized cancer prevention and treatment strategies, and suggest that PhenoAgeAccel may be a useful tool for identifying individuals at high risk of cancer.

    **Title:** Enhancing Species Distribution Models with Community-Sourced Data from the Biome Mobile App

    **Research Question:** Can community-sourced data from the Biome mobile app improve the accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs) in Japan, and what are the implications for ecosystem protection?

    **Methods:** We evaluated the quality of species occurrence records from the Biome app, which uses species identification algorithms and gamification elements to gather data from the public. We assessed the accuracy of species identification for various taxonomic groups and compared the performance of SDMs built with traditional survey data alone versus a combination of traditional and Biome data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but is below 90% for seed plants, molluscs, and fishes. Incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved the accuracy of SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan. Specifically, for endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models (Boyce index ≥ 0.9), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement.

    **Implications:** Combining multiple data sources, including community-sourced data from the Biome app, better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Our findings highlight the potential of community-based survey platforms like Biome to contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the value of incorporating community-sourced data from the Biome app into traditional survey data to improve the accuracy of species distribution models. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, we can develop more comprehensive and accurate models of species distributions, ultimately informing effective conservation and management strategies for ecosystems in Japan and beyond.

    **Title:** Dissecting the Role of Mesenchymal BMP Signaling in Lung Development and Congenital Pulmonary Cysts

    **Research Question:** What is the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development, and how does it contribute to the formation of congenital pulmonary cysts?

    **Methods:** We used genetic mouse models to investigate the role of Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development. We specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells and analyzed the resulting lung phenotypes.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupts normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. We observed severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. Additionally, we detected ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis. The discovery of a Smad-independent mechanism contributing to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions highlights the complexity of lung development and the need for further investigation into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying congenital lung diseases.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first in vivo evidence for the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the etiology of congenital lung diseases, such as congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these conditions.
Title: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 Nanodomains Regulate Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Activity in Living Cells

    Abstract:
    The regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity by anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), has been implicated in various cellular processes. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells remain poorly understood due to the difficulty in visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we employed super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. Our results show that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains aggregate before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreases after EGF stimulation and depends on phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), the EGFR effector that hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2. Artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P2 content of the plasma membrane reduces both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Furthermore, inhibition of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreases phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. These findings suggest that EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR molecules are mutually regulated. Our results provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity and highlight the importance of autogenous remodeling of the lipid environment in regulating EGFR activity.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells?

    Methods:
    We employed super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains aggregate before stimulation with EGF through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreases after EGF stimulation and depends on PLCγ. Artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P2 content of the plasma membrane reduces both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreases phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR molecules are mutually regulated. The spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity highlight the importance of autogenous remodeling of the lipid environment in regulating EGFR activity.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity and highlights the importance of autogenous remodeling of the lipid environment in regulating EGFR activity.
Title: Identification of a Mitochondrial Carrier for Glycolytic Intermediates in the Stramenopile Blastocystis: Implications for Carbon and Energy Metabolism and Therapeutic Targeting

    Abstract:
    Stramenopiles, a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, exhibit a unique branched glycolysis pathway, where the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we report the identification of a mitochondrial carrier protein in Blastocystis, a human intestinal protozoan, that transports glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) and dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) reveal that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Our findings demonstrate that Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, including complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance.

    Research Question:
    What is the molecular mechanism of glycolysis in the stramenopile Blastocystis, and how does it differ from other eukaryotes?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemical techniques to identify and characterize a mitochondrial carrier protein in Blastocystis that transports glycolytic intermediates.

    Main Findings:
    We identified a mitochondrial carrier protein in Blastocystis that transports glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate.

    **Title:** A Novel Framework for Human Genetic Association Studies: Haplotype Function Score (HFS)

    **Research Question:** Can a deep learning model-based framework, Haplotype Function Score (HFS), improve the understanding of the genetic basis of human complex traits compared to traditional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based methods?

    **Methods:** We developed a new framework, HFS, which uses a deep learning model (Sei) to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual. We applied this framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and compared the results with SNP-based analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our study identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with SNP-based analysis. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, and HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods. The integration of HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction.

    **Conclusions:** The HFS framework is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits. Our study highlights the potential of HFS to improve the identification of causal loci and gene identification, biological interpretation, and polygenic prediction of complex traits. While more progress is needed in algorithm and computation and data resources, our results suggest that HFS is a valuable tool for future genetic studies.

    **Title:** Hippocampal Plasticity and Cortisol Reduction Following Socio-Affective Mental Training in Healthy Adults

    **Research Question:** Do three different types of 3-month mental training modules targeting attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress in healthy adults?

    **Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study involving 332 healthy adults who underwent 3 months of mental training in one of three modules: attention-based mindfulness (Presence), socio-affective (Affect), or socio-cognitive (Perspective) skills. We used structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity. We also measured diurnal and chronic cortisol levels.

    **Main Findings:** We observed significant increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume (CA1-3) following the 3-month compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills (Affect module) compared to socio-cognitive skills (Perspective module) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. These structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective skills. Notably, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioral intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults. The observed increases in CA1-3 volumes following socio-affective mental training were small-sized effects, but consistent when independently assessing the left and right hippocampus subfields.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that socio-affective mental training can induce structural and functional plasticity of hippocampal subfields and reduce diurnal cortisol levels in healthy adults. Our findings have implications for the development of targeted interventions aimed at reducing stress and promoting hippocampal health. Future studies may directly test the potential specificity of the interrelationship between stress on the hippocampus using further targeted measurements.

    **Title:** Repeatability and Redundancy of Local Adaptation in Sunflowers: A Genome-Wide Association Study

    **Research Question:** What fraction of local adaptation in sunflowers can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion can still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect?

    **Methods:** We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on three species of sunflowers (Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris) to explore patterns of local adaptation. These species harbor large numbers of species-specific inversions that suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between locally adapted loci.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harboring an inversion in one species. This suggests that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbor mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. We estimate that the number of regions genome-wide that could potentially contribute to local adaptation for each variable and phenotype is related to genotypic redundancy.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci. This suggests that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability, while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions.

    **Conclusions:** Our results support the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions in sunflowers, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive. The observed repeatability associated with inversions highlights the importance of inversions in facilitating local adaptation, while also demonstrating that loci within an inversion can still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect.

    **Title:** Heterogeneous Aging Effects in Single Cells Contribute to Stereotypical Changes in Mammary Epithelia and Increased Susceptibility to Breast Cancer

    **Research Question:** How do aging effects in single cells contribute to stereotypical changes in mammary epithelia and increase susceptibility to breast cancer?

    **Methods:** We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger (<30 years old) and older (>55 years old) women to investigate the effects of aging on gene expression and lineage fidelity in mammary epithelia.

    **Main Findings:** We observed age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, increased transcriptional variance with age, and a loss of lineage fidelity in both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. We also found that epithelial expression of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age and provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals are a significant outcome of the aging process and are likely central to our understanding of the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age. We propose that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates how age-dependent directional and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia and explain how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. We provide evidence that increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals and propose that this mechanism could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers, particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes.

    **Title:** Leveraging Non-Target Reads from Plant DNA Sequencing for Phenotyping Plant Pest Resistance

    **Research Question:** Can non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing be used as phenotyping proxies to understand the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance?

    **Methods:** We analyzed whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing data from 207 natural lines of field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats showed higher aphid DNA load, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes and novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. We also found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, including differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure.

    **Implications:** Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species. We demonstrate that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. This approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research, particularly with the rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide.

    **Conclusions:** Our study contributes to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in Thlaspi arvense and highlights the potential of non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing for phenotyping plant pest resistance. This approach can be used to identify genes involved in defense and their regulators, including vital genes whose function cannot be determined through knockout experiments. The discovery of natural resistance alleles is crucial for breeding more pest-resistant crop varieties.

    Title: Exploring Collateral Sensitivity in Plasmodium falciparum DHODH Inhibitors: Implications for Malaria Treatment

    Research Question: Can the combination of two DHODH inhibitors, DSM265 and TCMDC-125334, based on their collateral sensitivity profiles, suppress the emergence of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in vitro?

    Methods: We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors, including DSM265 and TCMDC-125334. We focused on TCMDC-125334, which was active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265.

    Main Findings: We found that the most common mechanism of resistance to TCMDC-125334 was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although we identified one mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. Selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus, resulting in double mutant parasites that exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Furthermore, we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation that were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro.

    Implications: The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme. Our findings suggest that combining two DHODH inhibitors based on their collateral sensitivity profiles may not be sufficient to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the combination of DSM265 and TCMDC-125334, based on their collateral sensitivity profiles, fails to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro. While TCMDC-125334 exhibited increased activity against all mutant lines tested, including those that arose during selection with DSM265, we identified a point mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat malaria.

    **Title:** Biogeographic Patterns of Antimalarial Drug Resistance: A Novel Compartmental Model Reveals the Role of Strain Diversity

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between malaria transmission intensity and the establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance across different biogeographic regions?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The model was validated using chloroquine-resistant marker data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. We found that post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions.

    **Implications:** Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. The inclusion of strain diversity in the model provides a new mechanistic explanation as to why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to certain antimalarial drugs, despite a lower transmission intensity than Africa.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that control protocols should vary from region to region and that there is no one-size-fits-all cure for malaria control worldwide. The model implies that strain diversity and associated strain-specific host immunity dynamically tracked through the macroparasitic structure can predict the complex relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance frequencies. This study highlights the importance of considering strain diversity in mathematical models of drug resistance and underscores the need for region-specific control strategies to combat malaria.
Title: Investigating the Impact of Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) on Early Embryonic Development: A Stepwise In Vitro Differentiation Study

    Abstract:
    The increasing prevalence of cannabis use among pregnant women has raised concerns about the potential effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoid, on early embryonic development. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a stepwise in vitro differentiation system to investigate the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic processes. Our results demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner, but not in their primed counterparts. Notably, this increased proliferation is associated with moderate transcriptomic changes, whereas Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs' metabolic bivalence by enhancing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. Furthermore, a memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells (PGCLCs) in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These findings provide the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development, highlighting the importance of metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages.

    Methods:
    We employed a stepwise in vitro differentiation system to model the impact of early Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic events. We tested three distinct developmental windows: (1) exposure of ESCs, (2) exposure of EpiLCs, and (3) combined ESCs + EpiLCs exposure. Cells were exposed to Δ9-THC in a wide dose range of 0.1 nM-100µM, corresponding to physiologically-relevant concentrations of Δ9-THC in cannabis users.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive ESCs in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner, but not in their primed counterparts. This increased proliferation is associated with moderate transcriptomic changes, whereas Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs' metabolic bivalence by enhancing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. Furthermore, a memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to PGCLCs in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile.

    Implications:
    Our study provides the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development. The findings highlight the importance of metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the effects of cannabis use during pregnancy and the potential long-term consequences for offspring.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Δ9-THC exposure has a moderate but significant impact on early embryonic processes. The metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages highlight the importance of further research into the effects of cannabis use during pregnancy.

    **Title:** Extensive Copy Number Variation in Zebrafish NLR Immune Genes Reveals Complex Evolutionary Dynamics

    **Research Question:** What is the extent of copy number variation in zebrafish NLR immune genes, and how does it compare to laboratory strains?

    **Methods:** We sequenced the genomes of 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations to identify and characterize NLR immune genes.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a total of 1513 NLRs, significantly more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of these genes are present in all wild populations, but only 4% are found in 80% or more of individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population as laboratory strains. Notably, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is low, with around half of the copies being monomorphic and the remaining ones having few polymorphisms, indicative of purifying selection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the evolution of zebrafish NLR genes is far from neutral, with hundreds of gene copies being maintained despite purifying selection. This is in contrast to laboratory strains, which have reduced copy numbers and nucleotide diversity. The recent population bottleneck that led to the establishment of laboratory strains likely contributed to this reduction.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive characterization of copy number variation in zebrafish NLR immune genes, highlighting the complex evolutionary dynamics of this gene family. Our results lay the groundwork for future studies investigating the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large vertebrate gene families. The extensive copy number variation observed in zebrafish NLR genes suggests that diversity-generating mechanisms are active in this species, making it an ideal model for studying the evolution of large gene families.

    **Title:** Discovery of Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov.: Implications for the Evolution of Wind Dispersal Mechanisms in Early Spermatophytes

    **Research Question:** What is the significance of the newly discovered ovule Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. in understanding the evolution of wind dispersal mechanisms in early spermatophytes?

    **Methods:** A new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov., was discovered in the Jianchuan mine of China. The ovules were found to possess three integumentary wings extending outwards, folding inwards along the abaxial side, and enclosing most of the nucellus. The ovules were borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacked a cupule.

    **Main Findings:** Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. represents the second acupulate ovule in the Famennian and suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions.

    **Implications:** The discovery of Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms, such as seed plume and pappus. It also suggests that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with fewer wings. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of wind dispersal mechanisms in early spermatophytes.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. provides new insights into the evolution of wind dispersal mechanisms in early spermatophytes. The presence of three integumentary wings in Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. The mathematical analysis supports the idea that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with fewer wings. This study contributes to our understanding of the diversity of Famennian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings.
Title: Identification of RAPSYN as a Novel Therapeutic Target in Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Leukemia

    Abstract:
    Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a devastating hematological malignancy characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain significant challenges. Our study reveals a novel leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL, thereby enhancing its stability and promoting disease progression. We demonstrate that SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Notably, depletion of RAPSYN expression or its ligase activity decreases BCR-ABL stability and inhibits tumor formation and growth. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.

    Methods:
    We analyzed the expression of RAPSYN and BCR-ABL in patients with Ph+ leukemia and found a significant correlation between the two proteins. We also investigated the role of RAPSYN in mediating BCR-ABL neddylation and its impact on disease progression using in vitro and in vivo models.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that RAPSYN is highly expressed in Ph+ leukemia and promotes disease progression by stabilizing BCR-ABL via neddylation. We also demonstrate that SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Furthermore, we found that depletion of RAPSYN expression or its ligase activity decreases BCR-ABL stability and inhibits tumor formation and growth.

    Implications:
    Our study identifies RAPSYN as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. Targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation may provide an alternative strategy for overcoming TKI resistance and improving patient outcomes.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study reveals a novel leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL, thereby enhancing its stability and promoting disease progression. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. Further investigations are warranted to explore the potential of RAPSYN as a therapeutic target in other cancer types.
Title: Mining Active Peptidoglycan Hydrolases from Bacterial Proteomes using Lysin-Derived Antimicrobial Peptide-Primed Screening: A Novel Strategy for Antimicrobial Drug Discovery

    Abstract:

    Background: Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (lysins) have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hindered by the limited availability of phage genomes.

    Research Question: Can lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening be used to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes?

    Methods: We employed a novel strategy using the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome database. Five putative peptidoglycan hydrolases (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified, of which PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens, even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour.

    Main Findings: We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11, revealing that PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10.

    Implications: Our results provide new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs and highlight the potential of lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening as a novel strategy for mining active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening to discover new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties. The identification of PHAb10 and PHAb11 as potent bactericidal agents against multiple pathogens, including those resistant to conventional antibiotics, underscores the potential of this approach for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies.

    **Title:** Unveiling Pancreatic Cancer Symptom Trajectories: A Retrospective Study of Electronic Health Records and Registry Data

    **Background:** Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with limited treatment options. Early detection of symptoms and disease correlations is crucial for improving prognosis. This study aimed to investigate symptom and disease trajectories prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis using a combination of electronic health records (EHRs) and registry data.

    **Methods:** We analyzed 6.9 million patients from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) from 1994 to 2018, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We also extracted symptoms from free-text clinical notes in EHRs for 3,078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30,780 controls. We generated and compared symptom and disease trajectories using both data sources to uncover temporal patterns prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that text mining of EHRs complemented registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. We identified two symptom trajectories associated with lower median survival (<90 days): 'Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction' and 'Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies'. These findings provide a comprehensive comparison of symptom trajectories, leveraging the full potential of health data for early detection of pancreatic cancer risk factors.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates the value of combining EHRs and registry data to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The identified symptom trajectories may serve as early risk factors for screening purposes. Future applications could utilize AI and advanced text mining techniques to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in clinical settings.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the potential of deep phenotypical information stored in registry data and free-text EHRs for detecting temporal patterns prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The incorporation of multi-modality symptom trajectories derived from both EHRs and registry-based codes can harness the complete potential of health data, ultimately guiding better screening procedures and improving the lives of pancreatic cancer patients.

    **Title:** Developmental Trajectory of Slow Oscillation-Sleep Spindle Coupling from Childhood to Young Adulthood

    **Research Question:** How does the synchronization of slow oscillations and sleep spindles develop across childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood?

    **Methods:** This study employed a cross-sectional design to investigate age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children (5-6 and 8-11 years), adolescents (14-18 years), and young adults (20-26 years). Individualized detection of single events allowed for a detailed characterization of these oscillatory patterns.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed that while the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups. Notably, the coupling pattern was less precise in children. The study also found that fast spindle maturity, which indicates the similarity between development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups.

    **Implications:** The results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles enables precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the developmental trajectory of sleep and brain maturation.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the development of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns across childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. The findings suggest that the maturation of dominant, development-specific fast sleep spindles towards adult-like fast spindles may explain age-related differences in the strength and temporal precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. The study's results have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sleep and brain development, and may inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for sleep disorders.

    **Title:** Investigating the Abandonment of Understudied Genes in High-Throughput Experiments: A Systematic Analysis and Tool Development

    **Research Question:** Why are understudied genes systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results?

    **Methods:** We conducted a systematic analysis of 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect the selection of genes as research targets in high-throughput experiments. We evaluated the association between these factors and the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that 33 out of 45 factors are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes. We found that understudied genes are systematically abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. Furthermore, we observed that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the abandonment of understudied genes may be driven by the valid concern of biomedical researchers that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. This concern may lead authors of high-throughput studies to prioritize better-studied genes, resulting in the abandonment of understudied genes.

    **Conclusions:** To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we developed a tool called Find My Understudied Genes (FMUG), which allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. FMUG is a MacOS/Windows app available for download at fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging.

    **Future Directions:** Our study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors that influence the selection of genes as research targets. By using FMUG, researchers can identify understudied genes and promote their investigation, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms.
Title: Noncaloric Monosaccharides Induce Excessive Angiogenesis via the Foxo1a-Marcksl1a Pathway in Zebrafish Embryos

    Abstract:

    Background: Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides have been suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: Do noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos, and if so, what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    Methods: We established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Using this model, we examined the effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development and investigated the molecular mechanisms.

    Main Findings: Our results show that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs), by activating quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a.

    Implications: Our study provides new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms. The findings suggest that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides treatment could lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway.

    Conclusions: Our results have provided novel insights into the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides in human health and the underlying mechanisms. The identification of the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway as a key regulator of excessive angiogenesis induced by noncaloric monosaccharides highlights the need for further investigation into the potential health risks associated with the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages.

    **Title:** Leveraging Shared Structures for Efficient Memory Storage in Working Memory

    **Research Question:** How do individuals process and store multiple sequences in working memory (WM), and what neural mechanisms facilitate this process?

    **Methods:** In this study, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. We manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories to examine the effects on memory performance and neural activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Furthermore, neural reactivation of common trajectories was observed during both encoding and retention periods, and spontaneous replay of color sequences occurred when recalling location sequences. Importantly, neural reactivation correlated with WM behavior.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, facilitating efficient information organization in WM. This is supported by EEG recordings, which provide neural evidence for the employed ‘compressive’ strategy, including reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of color sequences during location recall.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides converging behavioral and neural evidence for the spontaneous leveraging of common structures to facilitate WM. Our results demonstrate that sequences with consistent color-location trajectories show enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. Moreover, neural replay occurs for color sequences but not for location sequences when subjects prepare to recall location sequences, supporting the spontaneous nature of neural replay. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying WM and highlight the importance of shared structures in facilitating efficient memory storage.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Structural and Functional Consequences of PURA Gene Mutations in Neurodevelopmental PURA Syndrome

    **Research Question:** How do genetic variations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder PURA syndrome, characterized by full disease penetrance despite modest structural alterations?

    **Methods:** We employed a multi-disciplinary approach, combining X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements to investigate the structural and functional integrity of human PURA (hsPURA) and the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations. We solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of hsPURA and analyzed the effects of mutations on protein folding, RNA binding, dimerization, and subcellular localization.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroy the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. Notably, we observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA, indicating that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. Molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements further supported these findings, highlighting the intrinsic motions of the N-terminal PUR domain.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. These findings offer an explanation for the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome, despite modest structural alterations. In contrast to other monogenetic disorders, where hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations are typically identified, pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PURA syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the human PURA gene. Our findings highlight the importance of structural flexibility and folding promiscuity in the pathogenesis of PURA syndrome and suggest that even conservative mutations can result in functional impairment. Further research is needed to understand why there is an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome.

    **Title:** TRPV4 and ANO1 Interaction Regulates Temperature-Dependent Perspiration and Friction Forces in Mouse Sweat Glands

    **Research Question:** Does the interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 play a role in temperature-dependent perspiration and friction forces in mouse sweat glands?

    **Methods:** We investigated the functional interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in mouse sweat glands using a combination of immunofluorescence, calcium imaging, and behavioral assays. We examined the expression of TRPV4, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in sweat glands of wild-type (WT) and TRPV4-deficient mice. We also assessed the effect of menthol, a TRPM8 activator, on sweating and friction forces in WT and TRPV4-deficient mice.

    **Main Findings:** We found that TRPV4 colocalized with ANO1 and AQP5 in secretory cells of sweat glands in mouse foot pads. TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating was temperature-dependent in WT mice, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice, and was inhibited by menthol in both WT and TRPM8KO mice. Basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. We also found that TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 plays a crucial role in temperature-dependent perspiration and friction forces in mouse sweat glands. The TRPV4/ANO1 complex is likely involved in the secretion of macromolecular components, water, and ions in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration and friction forces in mouse sweat glands, and that the TRPV4/ANO1 complex is a potential target for developing agents that regulate perspiration. These findings have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of anhidrosis and for the development of novel treatments for this condition.

    **Title:** A Universal Multi-Scale Description of Primate and Mammalian Cortices Reveals a Common Fractal Shape

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a universal, multi-scale description of primate and mammalian cortices that captures their diverse shapes and sizes?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the cerebral cortices of 11 primate species and over 70 other mammalian species using MRI data. We employed a novel method to express cortical morphology as a function of scale, revealing a common fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2.5.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighboring folds are merged, the cortices of primate and mammalian species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory. This trajectory overlaps with other mammalian species, indicating a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding.

    **Implications:** Our findings enable a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. We demonstrate a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, with a more than fourfold increase in effect size at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. This new understanding may generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a universal, multi-scale description of primate and mammalian cortices, revealing a common fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2.5. This new syntax enables a more rigorous characterization of brain morphology and morphological changes, with potential applications in the development of biomarkers for various conditions. Our findings suggest that some biological processes may only act on specific spatial scales, leaving other scales untouched, and that our novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes more effectively than traditional metrics.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Interplay between F-actin Dynamics and the NF-κB Pathway in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Cells

    **Research Question:** How do F-actin dynamics and the NF-κB pathway interact with RELA, a master regulator of immune and stress responses, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells?

    **Methods:** We employed live single-cell imaging, Bayesian analysis, RNA-seq, and siRNA-mediated depletion to investigate RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines. We also characterized the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells using computational and experimental approaches.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA in PDAC cells. We identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression, including TNFα-induced upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Furthermore, we established a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα, involving ARHGAP31 and NUAK2. We also characterized the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, showing that NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC. We identified novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between F-actin dynamics, the NF-κB pathway, and RELA in PDAC cells. Our findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the NF-κB pathway and F-actin dynamics in PDAC, a highly aggressive and treatment-resistant form of pancreatic cancer.

    **Title:** PTEN Mutations Disrupt GABAergic Neurodevelopment and Function in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** Do mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling in the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system?

    **Methods:** We used the Caenorhabditis elegans model system to investigate the effects of daf-18/PTEN mutations on GABAergic and cholinergic neurodevelopment and function. We analyzed the morphology and function of GABAergic and cholinergic motor neurons in daf-18/PTEN mutants and wild-type animals.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that daf-18/PTEN mutations selectively impact GABAergic (inhibitory) neurodevelopment and function, leading to a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. In contrast, cholinergic (excitatory) motor neurons remain unaffected.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects, particularly in the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The selective impact of daf-18/PTEN mutations on GABAergic signaling highlights the importance of maintaining a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition in proper brain function.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that mutations in daf-18/PTEN lead to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without significantly affecting cholinergic excitatory signals. We also show that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, thereby improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. These findings suggest that β-hydroxybutyrate may be a potential therapeutic agent for disorders associated with E/I imbalances, such as ASDs. The conservation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Antiviral Function of Interleukin-1β in Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-Induced Cell-Cell Fusion

    **Background:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection triggers innate immune responses that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Host factors, including proinflammatory cytokines, are essential for viral containment.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion and viral transmission?

    **Methods:** We employed quantitative and qualitative models to investigate the effects of soluble factors secreted by human monocytes on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion. Cytokine screening identified IL-1β as a key mediator of inflammation that inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at cell-cell junctions, thereby preventing syncytia formation. In vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection, highlighting the critical role of IL-1β in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion and viral transmission. These findings provide potential therapeutic targets for viral control.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the function and mechanism of IL-1β in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation and highlights the antiviral function of innate immune factors, including cytokines, against coronaviruses transmission. Our results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.
Title: Nutritional State-Dependent Modulation of Insulin-Producing Cells in Drosophila Reveals a Complex Network for Glucose Homeostasis and Adaptive Behavior

    Abstract:
    Insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila melanogaster play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells. We investigated the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity in response to nutritional and internal state changes using electrophysiological recordings. Our results demonstrate that IPC activity is strongly modulated by the nutritional state, decreasing during starvation and increasing after refeeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect. Furthermore, we found that diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44PINs) respond to glucose perfusion, but do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Functional connectivity experiments revealed that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Our findings suggest that IPCs and DH44Ns form an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.

    Methods:
    We used in vivo electrophysiological recordings to quantify the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPC activity in Drosophila. Flies were subjected to starvation or refeeding with glucose, fructose, or non-nutritive sugars, and IPC activity was measured using patch clamp recordings.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that IPC activity decreases during starvation and increases after refeeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. Glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, suggesting that IPCs do not directly sense changes in hemolymph sugar levels. In contrast, DH44PINs respond to glucose perfusion, but do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Functional connectivity experiments revealed that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that IPCs and DH44Ns form an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state. This complex network highlights the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity in response to nutritional and internal state changes, revealing a complex network of sugar-sensing neurons that work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. These findings have important implications for our understanding of glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in Drosophila and potentially in mammals.
Title: Large-Scale Endogenous Tagging of Proteins in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) using Split mNeonGreen

    Abstract:

    Background: Endogenous tags have revolutionized the field of cell biology by enabling the visualization and study of native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is a challenging task due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair.

    Research Question: Can the split mNeonGreen protein be used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in human iPSCs, enabling the study of protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types?

    Methods: We engineered a human iPS cell line to constitutively express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein (mNG21-10) and demonstrated its ability to enable fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment (mNG211). We also employed neural network-based image restoration to enable live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes, such as cytokinesis, in iPSCs.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the split mNeonGreen system enables efficient endogenous tagging of multiple genes in human iPSCs, and that neural network-based image restoration allows for high-temporal resolution imaging of dynamic cellular processes. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells.

    Implications: This study provides the foundation for a high-quality endogenous tag library in human iPSCs, enabling the study of protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro. This technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs, paving the way for the generation of a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells. This work opens up new avenues for studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms.
Title: Development and Validation of a Novel Electrolytic Lesioning Technique for Multielectrode Probes in Awake-Behaving Animals

    Abstract:
    This study presents a novel platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. The performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.

The technique provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe.

    Implications:
    This technique has the potential to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. The low-cost, external lesioning device can easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup, making it a valuable tool for researchers.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates the development and validation of a novel electrolytic lesioning technique for use with chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes in awake-behaving animals. This technique has the potential to revolutionize the field of systems neuroscience by enabling causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.

    **Title:** Bumblebees Fail to Detect Field-Relevant Concentrations of Neonicotinoid Pesticides in Nectar

    **Research Question:** Can bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) detect and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar using their mouthparts?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of behavioral assays and single-sensillum electrophysiology to investigate whether bumblebees can detect and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). We tested four neonicotinoid pesticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor) at concentrations spanning six orders of magnitude, including lethal doses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that bumblebees did not avoid consuming solutions containing field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons, resulting in a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that bumblebees are unable to detect and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides using their mouthparts. These findings have significant implications for the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in agriculture, as they may pose a risk to bumblebee populations. Our results also highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms of pesticide detection and avoidance in bees.
Title: Quantifying Zoonotic Disease Dynamics in Non-Human Primates: A Macroecological Analysis of Plasmodium knowlesi Prevalence in Southeast Asia

    Abstract:

    Background: Zoonotic diseases, such as Plasmodium knowlesi malaria, pose significant public health concerns in Southeast Asia. Non-human primates (NHPs) are the primary reservoir hosts of P. knowlesi, and understanding their infection dynamics is crucial for malaria elimination efforts.

    Research Question: What are the geographic determinants of Plasmodium knowlesi prevalence in NHPs across Southeast Asia, and how do they relate to human infection hotspots?

    Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites across Southeast Asia, assembling a georeferenced dataset of P. knowlesi prevalence. We used remote sensing data and statistical models to investigate the relationships between landscape complexity, forest fragmentation, and P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs.

    Main Findings: Our results show that P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We found that regions with higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots, and that parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Notably, we identified novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation, suggesting that habitat complexity may be a key driver of observed geographic variation in parasite burden.

    Implications: These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk. Our results highlight the importance of considering infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs in future public health interventions.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic assessment of P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs at a regional scale, revealing marked spatial heterogeneity and the role of landscape complexity in driving P. knowlesi infection rates. Our findings underscore the need for integrated approaches that account for the intersection of human epidemiology and wildlife ecology to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease transmission.

    **Title:** Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Insect-Plant Interactions: A Phylogenetic Analysis of Ancient Phytophagous Weevils (Belidae)

    **Research Question:** How did the rise of angiosperms and the breakup of Gondwana influence the evolution of trophic interactions between ancient phytophagous weevils (Belidae) and their host plants?

    **Methods:** We integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago (Ma) in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia (Australian region) and Proterhinus (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of insect-plant interactions and the impact of palaeogeographical events on the diversification of ancient phytophagous weevils. The results suggest that the rise of angiosperms and the breakup of Gondwana played a crucial role in shaping the evolutionary history of Belidae, leading to the development of new trophic interactions and the colonization of new host plants.

    **Conclusions:** Our phylogenetic analysis of ancient phytophagous weevils (Belidae) reveals a complex history of host plant shifts and adaptations to changing palaeogeographical conditions. The study highlights the importance of integrating molecular data with information from the fossil record to understand the evolution of insect-plant interactions and the impact of geological events on the diversification of ancient lineages.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Tumour Evolution: A High-Resolution Analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinomas

    **Research Question:** What are the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution in hepatocellular carcinomas, and how do mutations and cell death contribute to overall tumour growth?

    **Methods:** We leveraged published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. We employed spatial metrics of evolution to analyze the distribution of mutations and cell death throughout the tumour.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume, rather than at the surface. We found that mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour, and cell death contributes significantly to the overall tumour growth. Our results suggest that the growth rate of the tumour is uniform across the tumour volume.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the early evolution of tumours in vivo and shed light on the dynamics of tumour growth. Our methods can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tumour evolution.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of high-resolution spatial analysis in elucidating the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Our results challenge the conventional view of tumour growth, which posits that growth occurs predominantly at the surface. Instead, our findings suggest that tumour cells grow uniformly throughout the tumour volume, with cell death playing a significant role in overall tumour growth. These findings have important implications for our understanding of tumour biology and may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.
Title: Elucidating the Neuroendocrine Regulatory Mechanism of Seasonal Polyphenism in Cacopsylla chinensis: A Novel Role for Bursicon and Its Receptor

    Abstract:
    Seasonal polyphenism is a remarkable adaptation that enables organisms to cope with environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. Cacopsylla chinensis, a sap-sucking insect, exhibits seasonal polyphenism in the form of summer-form and winter-form, characterized by distinct morphological phenotypes. While previous studies have shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form, the underlying neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we report the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. We identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as the two subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which are regulated by low temperature (10°C) and CcTRPM. The CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β subunits form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Additionally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. Our findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.

    Research Question:
    What is the underlying neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism of seasonal polyphenism in Cacopsylla chinensis, and what is the role of Bursicon and its receptor in this process?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and behavioral experiments to investigate the role of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. We identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as the two subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis and demonstrated that they form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form. We also identified CcBurs-R as the Bursicon receptor and showed that it plays a critical role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway.

    Main Findings:
    We found that CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β are regulated by low temperature (10°C) and CcTRPM, and that they form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. We also demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.

    Implications:
    Our findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor. This study highlights the importance of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating cuticle development and seasonal polyphenism in C. chinensis.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism of seasonal polyphenism in Cacopsylla chinensis and highlights the critical role of Bursicon and its receptor in this process

    **Title:** Dual Targeting of Histone Deacetylases and MYC Activation as a Promising Therapeutic Strategy for Diffuse Midline Gliomas

    **Research Question:** Can dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC activation inhibit the growth of diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) harboring the H3-K27M mutation?

    **Methods:** We investigated the therapeutic potential of combining the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat with the MYC inhibitor Sulfopin in patient-derived cells and orthotopic xenograft models of H3-K27M DMGs.

    **Main Findings:** Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Vorinostat and Sulfopin resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability. Transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed a synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulating prominent oncogenic pathways, including mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and suggest that dual targeting of HDACs and MYC activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for this aggressive malignancy. The combination of Vorinostat and Sulfopin inhibits oncogenic transcriptional signatures and reduces tumor growth in vivo, underscoring the potential of this approach for the treatment of H3-K27M DMGs.

    **Conclusions:** This study proposes a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic and transcriptional pathways in H3-K27M-mutant DMG tumors. Our results emphasize the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy and provide a rationale for further investigation of dual targeting of HDACs and MYC activation in the treatment of H3-K27M DMGs.

    **Significance:** Diffuse midline gliomas are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. The H3-K27M mutation is a driver mutation in these tumors, leading to deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. Our study provides new insights into the epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlights the potential of dual targeting of HDACs and MYC activation as a promising therapeutic approach for this aggressive malignancy.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Infection Tolerance in the White-Footed Deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus): Implications for Zoonotic Disease Reservoirs

Abstract:

The white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a key reservoir for several zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, deermice exhibit no apparent disability or diminished fitness. To investigate the underlying mechanism of infection tolerance in this species, we compared genome-wide transcriptional responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, in P. leucopus, Mus musculus (mouse), and Rattus norvegicus (rat). Our results reveal distinct LPS response profiles in deermice, characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages, which differ from those observed in mice and rats. Notably, LPS-treated P. leucopus displayed reduced transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes compared to mice and rats. These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model, suggesting a conserved mechanism of infection tolerance in deermice. Furthermore, we found that deermice exhibited reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors, which may contribute to their ability to tolerate infections. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying infection tolerance in P. leucopus and have implications for understanding the biology of zoonotic disease reservoirs.

Research Question:
How does the white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) tolerate persistent infections with zoonotic pathogens without apparent disability or diminished fitness?

Methods:
We used a genome-wide transcriptional profiling approach to compare the response of P. leucopus, M. musculus, and R. norvegicus to LPS, a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens.

Main Findings:
* P. leucopus exhibited distinct LPS response profiles characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages.
* LPS-treated P. leucopus displayed reduced transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes compared to mice and rats.
* These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model.
* Deermice exhibited reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors.

Implications:
Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying infection tolerance in P. leucopus and have implications for understanding the biology of zoonotic disease reservoirs.

Conclusions:
The white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) exhibits a unique mechanism of infection tolerance, characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages, reduced transcription of interferon-gamma, and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These findings have important implications for understanding the biology of zoonotic disease reservoirs and may inform the development of new strategies for controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases.

    Title: Molecular Mechanism of CASP7 Substrate Discrimination and Divergence of CASP3/7-Mediated GSDME Activation in Vertebrates

    Research Question: What is the molecular mechanism underlying the differential cleavage of human GSDME by CASP3 and CASP7, and how does this relate to the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates?

    Methods: This study employed a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemical assays to investigate the cleavage of a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME by pufferfish and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME was performed to identify the regions responsible for cleavage.

    Main Findings: We identified a pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping experiments revealed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. A key residue in the p10 subunit was found to govern CASP7 substrate discrimination. This residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 but not in vertebrate CASP7, except in mammals. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME.

    Implications: These findings reveal the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates. The results suggest that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of pyroptosis and the regulation of programmed cell death in vertebrates. The results also suggest that the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules in mammals.

    **Title:** Investigating the Multi-Dimensional Effects of Ketamine on Neural and Behavioral Variability in Treatment-Resistant Depression

    **Background:** Ketamine has emerged as a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but inter-individual variability in response to ketamine remains poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's neural and behavioral effects.

    **Methods:** We conducted a single-blind, placebo-controlled study with 40 healthy participants who received an acute ketamine infusion (0.23 mg/kg initial bolus, 0.58 mg/kg/hr continuous infusion). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity using data-driven global brain connectivity (GBC) and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability. We found that ketamine's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not. Furthermore, behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that ketamine's effects on neural and behavioral variability are complex and multi-dimensional. By using a multi-dimensional approach to capture ketamine's acute effects, we were able to more closely relate ketamine's effects to its hypothesized molecular mechanisms, specifically SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps. These findings have significant implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies for TRD and highlight the need for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying ketamine's effects.

    **Title:** Exploring the Information-Maintaining Potential of Parabolic Growth in Stochastic Multispecies Populations: Implications for the RNA World Hypothesis

    **Research Question:** Can parabolic growth kinetics in stochastic multispecies populations alleviate the error threshold problem and promote the coexistence of diverse replicator species, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for the preservation of viable sequences in the early evolution of life?

    **Methods:** We employed a constant population model to investigate the heritable information-maintaining potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like template replicators displaying parabolic growth. We represented replicator sequences individually and explicitly considered copying error and energetic constraints in strand separation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species, while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. We also found that sequence properties (GC content) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that stochastic parabolic growth could have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes. The demonstrated diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that parabolic growth kinetics can alleviate the error threshold problem and promote the coexistence of diverse replicator species, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for the preservation of viable sequences in the early evolution of life. These findings support the RNA world hypothesis and suggest that fluctuations in building block availability may have favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation in the early evolution of life.

    **Title:** Nsp5-dependent cleavage of human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1) contributes to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection

    **Research Question:** Does the nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) of SARS-CoV-2 cleave and inactivate human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme required for post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between Nsp5 and TRMT1 using co-expression and proximity-dependent biotinylation assays. We also examined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on TRMT1 levels and tRNA modification patterns in human cells.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Nsp5 binds and cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites. The cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2,2G-modified tRNAs. Moreover, we provide evidence that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between Nsp5 and TRMT1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection could affect the function of TRMT1 with consequent effects on tRNA modification levels.

    **Conclusions:** This study uncovers TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of COVID-19. The identification of TRMT1 as a critical host factor required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between viral and host factors in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    **Title:** Accidental Virulence: Experimental Evolution of Multicellularity and Pathogenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** Can selection for a non-pathogenic trait, such as surface adherence, incidentally lead to the evolution of increased virulence in a microbe?

    **Methods:** Replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were artificially selected for adherence to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. The evolved strains were then tested for virulence against wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella).

    **Main Findings:** Selection for plastic adherence led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. These strains exhibited increased biofilm formation, flor formation, and pseudohyphal growth. Notably, wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains.

    **Implications:** Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of pathogenicity and the emergence of disease-causing microbes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits, including those associated with virulence. The evolution of hyper-multicellularity and increased virulence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae highlights the potential for ‘accidental virulence’ to occur in microbes that are not obligate pathogens. These findings have important implications for the development of strategies to prevent the emergence of disease-causing microbes in industrial, medical, and domestic settings.

    **Title:** Quantifying the Impact of Amino Acid Mutations on the Stability of Proteins Containing Prion-like Low Complexity Domains (PLDs)

    **Research Question:** Do scaling laws exist that can predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates in response to amino acid sequence mutations?

    **Methods:** We employed a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins (hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1). We systematically varied the amino acid sequence of the PLDs to determine how the phase behavior of PLDs changes with amino acid compositional perturbations.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These scaling laws are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested, suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates.

    **Implications:** Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. The identification of scaling laws that predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates based on amino acid sequence mutations has significant implications for understanding the misregulation of PLDs in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that scaling laws can be used to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates in response to amino acid sequence mutations. These laws are cumulative, meaning that the effects of successive mutations can be predicted by the addition of the appropriate laws, as long as the resulting mutation keeps within PLD composition and patterning biases. Our work provides a new framework to describe, quantitatively, the phase behavior of a large set of protein variants via the identification of scaling laws.

    **Title:** Predicting Individual Traits from Brain Dynamics using Hidden Markov Models and Fisher Kernels

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel approach to predict individual cognitive traits or clinical conditions from brain signals by leveraging the unique patterns of brain activity that unfold over time?

    **Methods:** We propose an approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Fisher kernels to describe dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns in brain activity. HMMs are probabilistic generative models that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. We applied this approach to fMRI data and compared it to other prediction methods, including time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts individual traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data. This approach preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. We demonstrated the potential of this approach to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits in an example fMRI dataset and simulated data.

    **Implications:** Our findings have broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine. By leveraging information about an individual's time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity, our approach can improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions. This is particularly important for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous training and test sets.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a novel approach to predict individual traits from brain dynamics using HMMs and Fisher kernels. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine. By preserving the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, our approach can be used to combine generative and predictive models, making it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians.

    **Title:** Rab12 Regulates LRRK2 Activity and Phosphorylation of Rab Substrates in Response to Lysosomal Damage

    **Background:** Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. However, the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Rab12 in regulating LRRK2 activity and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates in response to lysosomal damage?

    **Methods:** We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. We used a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes and demonstrate that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Rab12 regulates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage. Pathogenic PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates at the lysosome. Enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates.

    **Conclusions:** We identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity and demonstrate that it plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of LRRK2 activation and have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.

    **Title:** Automated Cell Cycle Analysis of Adherent and Non-Adherent Cells using FUCCI (CA)2 Technology

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a fully automated system for precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in both adherent and non-adherent cells using the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor?

    **Methods:** We combined a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm to enable precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. We validated this approach in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. We were able to follow single cells and manually annotate cell cycle phases according to the color of the red and green merged images, qualitatively confirming the impact of CDK inhibitors. Furthermore, the expected difference in cell cycle progression of NB4 vs Kasumi-1 cells was evident.

    **Implications:** This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells. Our system streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI (CA)2 indicator, making it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a fully automated system for precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in both adherent and non-adherent cells using the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor. This system is compatible with adherent cells and provides detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions, making it a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development. The complete experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5, and the scripts used for image and data analysis are publicly available, enabling customization to tailor the workflow according to specific requirements.

    **Title:** Ecological and Social Constraints Shape the Evolution of Prefrontal Brain Regions in Primates

    **Research Question:** What is the relative contribution of social and ecological constraints to the evolution of cognitive skills in primates, specifically in relation to the size of prefrontal brain regions involved in metacognition and working memory?

    **Methods:** This study employed an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Brain imaging data from 16 primate species were analyzed to measure the size of two prefrontal brain regions: the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The size of these regions was examined in relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables, including body mass, daily traveled distance, and population density.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the size of the FP and DLPFC, as well as the whole brain, is best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance, and population density. The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Notably, FP volume was more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, consistent with laboratory studies implicating FP in complex social interactions.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the relative weight of social and ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates. Our results support the ecological brain hypothesis, which posits that brain structure and function are shaped by the demands of the environment. The study also underscores the importance of considering both social and ecological factors in understanding the evolution of cognitive skills in primates.

    **Conclusions:** This study bridges the gap between cognitive neurosciences, behavioral ecology, and primate evolution by examining the relationship between prefrontal brain regions and socio-ecological variables in a large sample of primate species. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of metacognition and working memory in primates and highlight the need for further research on the metacognitive processes underlying social and foraging processes in the wild.

    **Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Muscle Fiber Radial Growth: A Novel Approach Using Fluorescence Imaging of Myofibrils with Image Deconvolution (FIM-ID)

    **Research Question:** Does radial growth of muscle fibers in response to mechanical loading occur through myofibril hypertrophy (increase in myofibril size) or myofibrillogenesis (increase in myofibril number)?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel method, FIM-ID (Fluorescence Imaging of Myofibrils with Image Deconvolution), to visualize myofibrils using a standard fluorescence microscope. We validated the accuracy of FIM-ID by comparing automated measurements of myofibril size and number with manual measurements obtained using electron microscopy (EM). We then applied FIM-ID to mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to investigate the mechanisms of muscle fiber radial growth.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the radial growth of muscle fibers in response to mechanical loading is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis, an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than myofibril hypertrophy, an increase in myofibril size. We observed a significant increase in the number of myofibrils per fiber in both mouse and human muscle biopsies after mechanical loading.

    **Implications:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of muscle growth and development, shedding light on the role of myofibrillogenesis in muscle fiber radial growth. The FIM-ID method developed in this study offers a time- and cost-effective means to study muscle growth and development, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that myofibrillogenesis is a key mechanism of muscle fiber radial growth in response to mechanical loading. The development of FIM-ID provides a novel approach to studying muscle growth and development, enabling researchers to investigate the ultrastructural characteristics of skeletal muscle with high resolution and accuracy. This study has important implications for our understanding of muscle growth and development, and the FIM-ID method has the potential to be widely adopted by researchers in the field.

    **Title:** Pathogenic Mutations in SNAP25 Disrupt Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis by Altering the Energy Landscape for Priming and Fusion

    **Background:** Synaptic vesicle exocytosis is a critical process in neuronal communication, mediated by the SNARE complex, which includes SNAP25. Mutations in SNAP25 have been linked to epileptic encephalopathy, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** We investigated the effects of three SNAP25 mutations (V48F, D166Y, and I67N) on synaptic vesicle exocytosis, focusing on their interactions with synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and the SNARE complex.

    **Methods:** We used in vitro assays and mouse hippocampal neurons to examine the effects of these mutations on Syt1-dependent vesicle docking, Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion, and the readily releasable pool (RRP) size.

    **Main Findings:** The V48F and D166Y mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion, while the I67N mutation increased the energy barrier for fusion. The V48F and D166Y mutants exhibited increased spontaneous release and decreased priming rates, whereas the I67N mutant decreased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion, leading to interdependent functional deficits. The V48F and D166Y mutants displayed gain-of-function features, including increased spontaneous release and release probability, whereas the I67N mutant exhibited a loss-of-function phenotype.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SNAP25 encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of the Syt1-SNARE interface in regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis. These findings have significant implications for the development of mechanism-based treatments for these disorders, which must account for the complex effects of single-point mutations on the energy landscape for priming and fusion.

Title: **Gender Bias in Research Evaluation: A Cross-Disciplinary Analysis of Research Quality and Funding Success Rates**

**Research Question:** Does the proportion of women in a research discipline influence the evaluation of research quality and funding success rates, and if so, what are the implications of this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We conducted a cross-disciplinary analysis of research data from 30 countries, using independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers. We examined the correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and research quality evaluations, as well as funding success rates. We controlled for researcher characteristics such as age, research institution, and publishing patterns to ensure the robustness of our findings.

**Main Findings:** Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and lower research quality evaluations and funding success rates. Specifically, researchers in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations and have lower funding success rates compared to those in male-dominated disciplines. This effect is observed for both men and women, and is robust to bibliometric differences across disciplines.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that research from female-dominated disciplines is consistently evaluated as lower quality than research from male-dominated disciplines. This has a detrimental effect on everyone in those disciplines, but will disproportionately affect women, who are already underrepresented in many fields. This phenomenon may be related to the feminization of a discipline over time, although our data do not allow us to explore this hypothesis further.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence of a pervasive bias in research evaluation, where the proportion of women in a discipline influences the evaluation of research quality and funding success rates. These findings have important implications for promoting diversity and inclusion in research, and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors that influence research evaluation. By acknowledging and addressing this bias, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive research environment that values the contributions of all researchers, regardless of their gender.

    **Title:** Programmable Genome Editing via Protein-Protein Proximity: A Novel Strategy for Synthetic Molecular Circuits

    **Research Question:** Can protein-protein interactions be harnessed to control genome editing in living cells, enabling the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel strategy, termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrated that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can activate prime editing or base editing in human cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that P3 editing can be used to control genome editing via specific interactions between a pair of tagged protein domains. We engineered the crRNA-MS2/BoxB-petracrRNA design to improve the efficiency and specificity of P3 editing. Furthermore, we explored the potential of P3 editing to incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, enabling specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit.

    **Implications:** P3 editing enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. This strategy has the potential to expand the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits, enabling the design of more complex and programmable biological systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using protein-protein interactions to control genome editing in living cells, paving the way for the development of synthetic molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. The P3 editing strategy offers a powerful tool for the design of complex biological systems, with potential applications in basic research, biotechnology, and biomedicine.

    **Title:** Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Stabilize the Selectivity Filter of KCNQ1/KCNE1 Channels to Increase IKs Conductance

    **Research Question:** How do polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increase the maximal conductance (Gmax) of the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs) mediated by the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex in cardiomyocytes?

    **Methods:** Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to investigate the effects of PUFAs on KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels expressed in HEK293 cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PUFAs increase the Gmax of IKs channels by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. The selectivity filter is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability of IKs channels. PUFAs promote interactions between residues in the selectivity filter, favoring the conductive conformation of the channel pore.

    **Implications:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism by which PUFAs increase IKs conductance, which is crucial for the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. The findings have implications for the development of therapeutic interventions for long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition caused by mutations in the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that PUFAs stabilize the selectivity filter of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels, leading to an increase in IKs conductance. This mechanism is distinct from the previously described "lipoelectric" mechanism, which involves shifting the voltage dependence of activation. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of IKs channel function and have potential implications for the treatment of LQTS. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of PUFAs in restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval.
Title: Identification of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone as a Direct and Potent Inhibitor of Pyridoxal 5’-Phosphate Phosphatase: Implications for Vitamin B6-Associated Pathologies

    Abstract:

    Background: Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in various human brain disorders, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme controlling pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) levels, represents a potential therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors are lacking.

    Research Question: Can we identify a PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in the murine hippocampus, providing a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors?

    Methods: We employed a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry to discover and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor.

    Main Findings: We found that 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner.

    Implications: Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor validates PDXP as a druggable target for controlling intracellular PLP levels in the brain. Notably, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, and our findings offer novel mechanistic insights into its previously debated mechanism of action.

    Conclusions: The identification of 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor provides a promising therapeutic strategy for vitamin B6-associated pathologies. Our results suggest that PDXP inhibitors, such as 7,8-DHF, may be used to elevate intracellular PLP levels in the brain, potentially improving cognitive function in individuals with vitamin B6 deficiency. Further studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of PDXP inhibitors in human brain disorders.

    **Title:** Wnt Signaling Coordinates the Production and Migration of Distal Tip Cells in C. elegans Gonadogenesis

    **Research Question:** How is the mirror-symmetric structure of the C. elegans gonad established during development, and what is the role of Wnt signaling in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in the development of the C. elegans gonad, focusing on the somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs) Z1 and Z4, which undergo asymmetric divisions to produce distal tip cells (DTCs). We analyzed the effects of mutations in the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) on SGP polarity and DTC migration.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 is controlled by the redundant functions of LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and the three Wnt proteins. CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse polarity in Z1 and normal polarity in Z4. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants, the polarity of Z1 is reversed, leading to mis-migration of DTCs to the posterior side. We also observed similar mis-migration in cki-1 (RNAi) animals, which produce ectopic DTCs.

    **Implications:** Our results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key factor in their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in establishing the mirror-symmetric structure of the C. elegans gonad by regulating the polarity of SGP cells and the migration of DTCs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying gonadogenesis and have implications for understanding the development of other mirror-symmetric organs in animals.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Drug Resistance Tradeoffs in Yeast: A High-Throughput Evolutionary Approach

    **Background:** The emergence of drug-resistant pathogens poses a significant challenge to modern medicine. One promising strategy to combat resistance is to design multidrug therapies that exploit tradeoffs, where resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable and consistent remains unclear.

    **Research Question:** Can we identify distinct classes of drug-resistant mutants in yeast that exhibit characteristic tradeoffs, and do these tradeoffs imply different underlying mechanisms of resistance?

    **Methods:** We performed high-throughput evolution experiments using lineage-tracking to capture a diverse spectrum of mutations that confer fitness advantages in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantified fitness tradeoffs for 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the mutants group into six distinct classes with characteristic tradeoffs, suggesting that each class affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Notably, some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. Furthermore, mutants to the same gene exhibit different tradeoffs, underscoring the complexity of drug resistance.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. However, by grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, we can reduce the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from 774 to a manageable panel of six types, facilitating the investigation of molecular mechanisms. This approach may empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the utility of high-throughput evolutionary approaches to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their associated tradeoffs. By identifying distinct classes of mutants with characteristic tradeoffs, we provide a framework for understanding the phenotypic effects of mutation and inform the development of multidrug regimens that exploit tradeoffs to combat resistance.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Neural Mechanisms of Central Tendency Bias in Working Memory

    **Research Question:** What is the neural basis of central tendency bias, a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of behavioral experiments in rats and humans, as well as optogenetic inactivation of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying central tendency bias. We used an auditory delayed comparison task in rats and a parametric working memory (PWM) task in humans to examine the effects of PPC inactivation on contraction bias.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that silencing the PPC in rats reduced both short-term and contraction biases, suggesting that these biases may be more related than previously thought. We propose a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior, where a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience produces short-term sensory history biases, leading to contraction bias. Our model is consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provides predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and perception. The results suggest that central tendency bias is not an optimal strategy, but rather a statistical effect of errors in working memory, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in preceding trials. This challenges the traditional view of contraction bias as an expression of the brain's ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms of central tendency bias and highlights the importance of the PPC in modulating this bias. The results of our model are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of working memory and perception.

    **Title:** Overcoming Chemoresistance and Immunotherapy Evasion in Lung Cancer through PDLIM2-Based Combination Therapy

    **Background:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with chemotherapy have shown limited efficacy in most cancer patients, including those with lung cancer. Recent studies have identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer, contributing to chemoresistance and immunotherapy evasion.

    **Research Question:** Can PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs in lung cancer?

    **Methods:** Human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. An endogenous mouse lung cancer model was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administered nanoPDLIM2 and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. Systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, resulting in complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs.

    **Implications:** These findings establish a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers. The combination of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1, and chemotherapeutic drugs induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals with a high safety profile. These preclinical data provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of PDLIM2-based combination therapy in overcoming chemoresistance and immunotherapy evasion in lung cancer. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel combination treatments for lung cancer and other cancers with PDLIM2 repression.
Title: Elucidating the Cellular Stress Response Pathway as a Physiological Food Evaluation System for Assessing Nutritional Deficiencies in Food

    Abstract:

    Background: Animals must develop a system to evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms regulating this chronic physiological food evaluation system remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of the cellular stress response pathway in assessing nutritional deficiencies in food and how does it influence feeding behavior?

    Methods: We established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and used it to investigate the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. Specifically, we examined the unfolded protein response (UPRER) - innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis and its neuronal function in regulating feeding behaviors.

    Main Findings: We found that heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli), a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPRER and immune response, which encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER-PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis.

    Implications: This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments. Our findings suggest that the UPRER-PMK-1 axis plays a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-E. coli, and helping animals avoid these environments.

    Conclusions: The cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system that assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the UPRER - innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis. This slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by the quick sensory nervous system. Our study highlights the importance of the UPRER-PMK-1 axis in regulating feeding behaviors and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying food quality evaluation in animals.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Sugar Nucleotide Activation of G-Protein Coupled Receptors: A Molecular Dynamics Study of P2Y14 and P2Y12

    **Research Question:** How do carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and functional study to investigate the sugar nucleotide activation of P2Y14, a drug target for inflammation and immune responses. We identified the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar-binding site on P2Y14 and revealed that UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging transmembrane (TM) helices 2 and 7.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a conserved salt bridging chain (K2.60-D2.64-K7.35-E7.36 [KDKE]) between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14, which distinguishes different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We also identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12). Furthermore, we designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12.

    **Implications:** Our results expand our understanding of the activation of purinergic receptors and provide insights for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs targeting GPCRs. The conserved sugar-binding motif identified in P2Y14 and P2Y12 suggests that other GPCRs may also be modulated by carbohydrates.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif in both P2Y12 and P2Y14, extending our understanding of how carbohydrates regulate GPCRs. The molecular models of different sugar nucleotides provide valuable details for carbohydrate activation and recognition of these receptors, inspiring further carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs. Further investigations focused on carbohydrate regulation of GPCRs will continue to add new concepts and physiological understanding to the field.

    Title: Glial Ferritin Regulates Self-Renewal and Differentiation of Drosophila Neural Stem Cells through Bicellular Iron Homeostasis

    Research Question: Do glial cells play a crucial role in regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of Drosophila neural stem cells (NBs) through iron homeostasis?

    Methods: We investigated the role of iron homeostasis in Drosophila CNS by knocking down genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NBs, neurons, and glial cells. We observed that only glial knockdown of ferritin-related genes led to NB loss and defective brain development.

    Main Findings: Our results show that ferritin produced by glial cells cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for energy production, which is essential for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. Knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. Furthermore, we found that glial ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression, and the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis.

    Implications: Our study demonstrates that glial cells are indispensable for maintaining the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development. The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NBs from the need to produce ferritin and transferring the potential risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress to glial cells.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of NBs and suggest that glial ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism may exist in other stem cells and their niches, and further studies are needed to explore this possibility. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of iron homeostasis in maintaining normal NB function during neural development and suggest that dysregulation of iron homeostasis may contribute to the development of tumors.
Title: Elucidating the Relationship Between Cancer Mortality and COVID-19 on a Population Level: A Comparative Analysis of US Vital Statistics

    Abstract:

    Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the impact of cancer on mortality rates. However, several countries have reported that cancer-related deaths remained within historic levels during the pandemic. This study aims to investigate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the United States.

    Methods: We analyzed US vital statistics, comparing pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying cause (UC) and multiple cause (MC) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. We simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition.

    Main Findings: Nationally in 2020, MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to approximately 13,600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2-7%) than cancers with a poor survival rate (lung and pancreatic, 0-1%). In contrast, there was a substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer’s (19%).

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. This implies that the lack of excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the competing mortality risk from cancer itself rather than protection conferred from immunosuppression.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of considering MC-of-death records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen. The results demonstrate that cancer mortality patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are influenced by the size and age of the population living with cancer, as well as life expectancy under cancer diagnosis. These factors operate irrespective of the true biological relationship between COVID-19 severity and cancer.

    **Title:** The Smc5/6 Complex Plays a Crucial Role in R-Loop Removal from Eukaryotic Genomes

    **Research Question:** What is the cellular process responsible for the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic genomes, and what is the role of the Smc5/6 complex in this process?

    **Methods:** We used budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution to investigate the role of the Smc5/6 complex in R-loop removal. We also performed in vitro experiments to demonstrate the Smc5/6 complex's ability to promote R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. We also demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions. Furthermore, we show that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by RNase H2 in vitro.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. We propose a model where the Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels – within and between pathways – in the cellular response to R-loop formation. Our results also suggest that the severe growth defects of yeast defective in both RNase H and the Smc5/6 complex can be linked to an accumulation of R-loops in the chromosomes of these cells.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our work demonstrates a direct and active involvement of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic chromosomes. Our findings provide new insights into the cellular processes responsible for R-loop removal and highlight the importance of the Smc5/6 complex in maintaining genome stability.

    **Title:** Preserved Communication Abilities in Aging: A Longitudinal Study of Neural Filtering and Listening Behavior

    **Research Question:** Does the age-typical loss of sensory acuity in older adults compensate for preserved attentional neural filtering, and can this compensatory brain-behavior link predict individual change in listening behavior over time?

    **Methods:** We analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral data from 105 aging individuals (39-82 years) across two measurement timepoints (T1 and T2, separated by 2 years). We used linear mixed-effect models to examine cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes in hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to expectations, listening-task performance remained stable over the 2-year period, despite a decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity. Moreover, neural filtering and listening behavior were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint, but not longitudinally. We found no evidence that neural filtering at T1 or its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year change in listening behavior.

    **Implications:** Our results raise caution on the use of attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behavior. The lack of longitudinal stability in the brain-behavior link suggests that neural filtering may not be a reliable compensatory mechanism for age-related sensory decline.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between neural filtering, listening behavior, and aging. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between sensory and cognitive processes in older adults. The results have implications for the development of interventions aimed at preserving communication abilities in aging populations. Future research should focus on identifying alternative predictors of individual change in listening behavior and exploring the neural mechanisms underlying preserved communication abilities in older adults.

    **Title:** Chemosensation and the Evolution of Therapeutic Use of Botanical Drugs in Ancient Graeco-Roman Times

    **Research Question:** Can the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as particular tastes and flavours, predict the therapeutic use of botanical drugs in ancient Graeco-Roman times?

    **Methods:** We conducted a tasting-panel study to generate data on the chemosensory qualities of 22 botanical drugs used in ancient Graeco-Roman medicine. We then applied phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models to test whether these chemosensory qualities, as well as their overall intensity and complexity, predicted the recorded therapeutic uses of these drugs.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that chemosensation is strongly predictive of therapeutic use. Botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours, and 21 out of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. Notably, we found that starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs were associated with versatility, in addition to the common notion of bitter-tasting medicines.

    **Implications:** Our study suggests that the uses of drugs in ancient Graeco-Roman times were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology. This challenges the traditional view that the theory of humours, which underpinned Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age, lacked scientific basis. Instead, we propose that taste and flavour perception of botanical drugs links humoral theory to modern medicine.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties. We show that chemosensory perception connects ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science, even though aetiologies were fundamentally different in Graeco-Roman times. Our findings highlight the importance of chemosensation in the evolution of therapeutic use of botanical drugs and provide new insights into the development of Western medicine.

    **Title:** Bacterial Vampirism: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Enterobacteriaceae Attraction to Human Serum

    **Research Question:** What are the bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying the attraction of Enterobacteriaceae to human serum, leading to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia?

    **Methods:** We employed an injection-based microfluidics device to simulate GI bleeding and investigated the attraction of clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri to human serum. We used chemotaxis assays to examine the role of the chemoreceptor Tsr in recognizing L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum. Crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine were determined to identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Enterobacteriaceae are rapidly attracted to human serum, which is sufficient to induce bacterial attraction even in femtoliter volumes. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, recognized by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We identified a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues and found Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the attraction of Enterobacteriaceae to human serum and highlights the importance of chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr in this process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of Enterobacteriaceae and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent bloodstream infections.

    Title: Unveiling the Conserved Genetic Program of Metazoan Male Germ Cells: Implications for Spermatogenesis and Human Infertility

    Research Question: What is the conserved genetic program that defines the cellular identity of male germ cells across animal species, and how does it relate to spermatogenesis and human infertility?

    Methods: We conducted a network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to identify the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimated the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes.

    Main Findings: Our analysis revealed a deeply conserved genetic scaffold of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncovered 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility.

    Implications: Our findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies. We propose that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact.

    Conclusions: We have identified a conserved male germ cell gene expression program that spans more than 600 million years of evolution, providing clinical insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. Our results suggest that deeply conserved genes remain central components in the male germ cell transcriptome of evolutionarily distant species, despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and a preferential birthplace for new genes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of spermatogenesis and human infertility, and highlight the importance of considering evolutionary history in the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive diseases.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Roles of Each Flagellum in Synchronous Beating of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

    **Research Question:** How do the two flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii coordinate their beating during synchronous swimming, and what is the role of each flagellum in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum of C. reinhardtii and used oscillatory flows to exert biased loads on one flagellum. We combined experiments, computations, and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the coordinated beating of the two flagella responds only to the load exerted on the cis flagellum, and that this asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. We found that the cis flagellum leads the beating, and its dynamic properties, such as frequency and waveform, are copied by the trans flagellum.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implications for the tactic behaviors of biflagellates. The dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardtii's tactic motility, and our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying this process.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the two flagella of C. reinhardtii have differential roles in coordination, with the cis flagellum leading the beating and the trans flagellum responding to the load exerted on the cis flagellum. This unilateral coupling between the two flagella allows for the fine-tuning of flagellar beating amplitudes, enabling C. reinhardtii to steer and navigate its environment. Our results provide a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the tactic behaviors of biflagellates and have implications for the study of flagellate motility in general.
Title: Intermittent Fasting Promotes Beigeing of Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue through the Intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R Axis

    Abstract:

    Background: The metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting (IF) are well-documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of intestinal type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in promoting beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) during IF?

    Methods: We employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effects of IF on ILC3s and their role in beigeing of WAT. Specifically, we used adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s, exogenous IL-22 administration, and IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) deficiency to elucidate the ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis in beigeing of WAT.

    Main Findings: Our results show that IF promotes IL-22 production by ILC3s, leading to beigeing of subcutaneous WAT. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of WAT in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased beigeing of WAT, while IL-22R deficiency attenuated the beigeing induced by IF. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s during IF. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions suggested that IF stimulates the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages.

    Implications: Our findings establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of WAT and suggest that the ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefits of IF.

    Conclusions: This study reveals a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue, highlighting the critical role of intestinal ILC3s in promoting beigeing of WAT during IF. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the metabolic benefits of IF and have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis in metabolic diseases.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Associative and Non-Associative Mechanisms in Defensive Behavior: A Pavlovian Conditioning Paradigm

    **Research Question:** How do associative and non-associative mechanisms contribute to the expression of defensive behavior in response to a serial compound stimulus (SCS) paired with footshock in mice?

    **Methods:** We employed a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm to investigate the effects of associative and non-associative mechanisms on defensive behavior in male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice. Mice were subjected to a paired SCS-footshock group, as well as four control groups: pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, and paired or unpaired presentations.

    **Main Findings:** On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period and explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. In contrast, the unpaired and reversed SCS groups showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely exhibited jumping or darting during WN. During extinction, the paired group's tone-induced freezing decreased, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. The results highlight the importance of considering both associative and non-associative mechanisms in understanding defensive behavior.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the complex interplay between associative and non-associative mechanisms in the expression of defensive behavior. The use of a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors allows for a more comprehensive understanding of defensive response dynamics. These findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for anxiety disorders and stress-related conditions.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Functional Advantage of Sinusoidal Encoding in Insect Head Direction Circuits

    **Research Question:** Does the sinusoidal encoding of head direction in insects offer a particular functional advantage, or is it an evolutionary coincidence?

    **Methods:** To address this question, we established the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and demonstrated that many circuits can perform this function with different activity patterns. We then compared these patterns and found that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between encoding neurons.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the sinusoidal encoding of head direction is not just an evolutionary coincidence, but rather offers a functional advantage due to its noise-resilient properties. We also demonstrated that this optimal connectivity pattern is consistent with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and fruit fly. Furthermore, we showed that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, suggesting that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of insect navigation and the evolution of neural circuits. The consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact, but rather can be explained by basic evolutionary principles. Our results also suggest that the sinusoidal encoding of head direction may be a common motif in insect navigation, facilitating elementwise vector addition.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the sinusoidal encoding of head direction in insects offers a functional advantage due to its noise-resilient properties. We demonstrate that this optimal connectivity pattern is consistent with anatomical data from the locust and fruit fly, and show that it can emerge using Hebbian plasticity. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of insect navigation and the evolution of neural circuits, and suggest that the sinusoidal encoding of head direction may be a common motif in insect navigation.

    **Title:** CISD1: A Downstream Mediator of Parkinson’s Disease Pathophysiology

    **Background:** Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of CISD1, a mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease, particularly in the context of PINK1 mutations?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of CISD1 in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients using immunoblotting, overexpression, and loss-of-function approaches.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide bridge, rendering CISD1 unable to coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. In contrast, complete loss of Cisd rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that CISD1, particularly its iron-depleted form, operates downstream of PINK1, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that CISD1, specifically its iron-depleted form, is a downstream mediator of the pathophysiological effects arising from the loss of PINK1 function, and to a certain extent, Parkin loss of function. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson’s disease and highlight CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.

    **Title:** SAP54, a Phytoplasma Effector, Modulates Leafhopper Vector Attraction and Host Plant Development through SVP Degradation

    **Research Question:** How does the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, influence leafhopper vector attraction and host plant development?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of SAP54 in the interaction between phytoplasma-infected plants and leafhopper vectors using a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and behavioral experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that SAP54 promotes the degradation of the MADS-box transcription factor SVP in leaves exposed to leafhopper males, leading to a preference for female leafhoppers to reproduce on these plants. In contrast, SAP54 alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to males, making them more vulnerable to leafhopper colonization.

    **Implications:** Our research highlights the dual role of SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction, which is integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. SAP54 acts as a molecular "matchmaker" by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves, facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by leafhoppers. This study provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes and opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings underscore the sophisticated regulatory effect of SVP and other MADS-box transcription factors targeted by SAP54 on plant responses to the different sexes of the herbivores. The intricate interaction between SAP54, SVP, and leafhoppers has significant implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between phytoplasmas, their plant hosts, and insect vectors. This study contributes to the mechanistic understanding of insect gender-specific factors targeted by parasites and highlights the importance of SAP54 in promoting the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors and facilitating phytoplasma transmission.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Antifungal Tolerance in Candida albicans through Single-Cell Transcriptomics

    Abstract:

    Background: Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments often fail due to the development of drug tolerance in C. albicans cells, allowing them to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration.

    Research Question: What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of antifungal tolerance in C. albicans at the single-cell level?

    Methods: We employed a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform (DROP-seq) to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of individual C. albicans cells in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs, specifically fluconazole (FCZ).

    Main Findings: Our results reveal that C. albicans cells exhibit heterogeneous expression profiles that correlate with cell cycle stage, with distinct metabolic and stress responses. Upon exposure to FCZ, surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: the Ribo-dominant (Rd) state, characterized by upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, and the Stress-dominant (Sd) state, enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying antifungal tolerance in C. albicans, which could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this opportunistic pathogen.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics in elucidating the complex mechanisms of antifungal tolerance in C. albicans. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the heterogeneity of C. albicans populations in response to antifungal drugs, which could lead to the development of more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.

    **Title:** Quantifying Species Adaptation at the Codon Level: A Novel Approach Using the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS)

    **Background:** The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits that species vary in the effectiveness of selection, which determines the minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be purged and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, effective population size is often estimated from putatively neutral genetic diversity, but this approach is confounded by among-species variation in GC content and amino acid composition.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel metric to quantify species adaptation at the codon level, correcting for confounders such as GC content and amino acid composition?

    **Methods:** We propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS) based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, which corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations and the Effective Number of Codons (ENC) to show that protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CAIS and ENC can be estimated from a single complete genome without requiring polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances. CAIS is not confounded with amino acid frequencies, making it a more direct measure of species adaptedness at the codon level.

    **Implications:** Our novel metric, CAIS, offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species. This approach can be applied to a wide range of species, including those with limited data availability.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates. Our results suggest that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias. This study provides a novel approach to quantify species adaptation at the codon level, offering insights into the effectiveness of selection in different species.

    **Title:** Mechanisms of Bacterial ATP Release and Its Role in Sepsis Pathogenesis

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms by which bacteria release extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and how does this process contribute to sepsis pathogenesis?

    **Methods:** We used genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) to investigate the mechanisms of ATP release. We also employed a mouse model of abdominal sepsis to analyze the local and systemic effects of bacterial ATP.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that ATP release by E. coli is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane and impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane. We also show that bacterial ATP is released in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, we found that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. Furthermore, we discovered that bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulate genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially exacerbating sepsis severity.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. These findings have significant implications for the development of strategies to target inflammation in sepsis. By understanding how bacteria release ATP and how this process contributes to sepsis, we may be able to develop novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate the severity of sepsis.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its role in sepsis pathogenesis. Our findings suggest that bacterial ATP plays a critical role in suppressing local immune responses and exacerbating sepsis severity. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to target this process in sepsis.

    **Title:** The Mediating Role of Cognitive Intelligence in the Relationship between Genetic and Environmental Factors and Psychotic-Like Experiences in Children

    **Background:** Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in children are associated with an increased risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs.

    **Research Question:** Do genetic and environmental factors, such as familial and neighborhood environment, influence cognitive intelligence and PLEs in children, and does cognitive intelligence mediate the relationship between these factors and PLEs?

    **Methods:** We analyzed large-scale longitudinal data from 6,602 children aged 9-11 years from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. We employed linear mixed models and a novel structural equation modeling (SEM) method to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores (PGSs), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs.

    **Main Findings:** Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs.

    **Implications:** This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for the mediating role of cognitive intelligence in the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs in children. The findings suggest that cognitive intelligence is a critical mediator of the effects of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs, and that supportive parenting and positive school environments are key factors in reducing PLEs. These results have important implications for the prevention and early intervention of mental health disorders in children.

    **Title:** FGF8 Signaling Establishes Graded Positional Cues for Regional Cellular Responses in Human Cerebral Organoids

    **Research Question:** How does FGF8 signaling influence regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids during early fetal telencephalic development?

    **Methods:** We employed human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effects of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We treated cerebral organoids with FGF8 and analyzed the resulting cellular and molecular changes across developmental stages.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic regions, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a clear FGF8-mediated induction of ventral telencephalic genes, suggesting that FGF8 signaling promotes ventral identity. We also observed upregulation of ventral genes such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3, and downregulation of dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. FGF8 efficiently modulates NR2F1 and other genes associated with brain disorders in human FOXG1+ telencephalic cells, underscoring its critical role in the fine-tuning of key neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways.

    **Conclusions:** Our results highlight an FGF8-dependent effect on regional identity, along with the modulation of several neurodevelopmental disorder-related targets, including an evolutionarily conserved FGF8-NR2F1 molecular axis. We propose that FGF8-mediated modulation of key developmental genes guides the developmental trajectories of human brain cells along the D/V and A/P telencephalic axes. The ability of FGF8 to modulate target genes can also vary based on the regional identity of the FGF8-exposed cells, underscoring the complexity of FGF8 signaling in human cerebral organoids.

    **Title:** Nutritional Status Drives Sleep-Wake Rhythm Development in Drosophila Larvae

    **Research Question:** How do developing Drosophila larvae detect changes in their nutritional environments to drive the circadian consolidation of sleep and feeding at the 3rd instar larval stage?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae using a combination of behavioral and molecular approaches. We analyzed the sleep and feeding patterns of Drosophila larvae at different developmental stages, from the 2nd instar (L2) to the 3rd instar (L3). We also manipulated the nutritional environment of L3 larvae to disrupt their feeding patterns and examined the effects on sleep-wake rhythms and long-term memory (LTM) capabilities.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that sleep and feeding patterns in Drosophila larvae lack strong daily rhythms during the 2nd instar (L2) stage. However, by the 3rd instar (L3) stage, these behaviors become organized into daily patterns. Forcing L3 larvae to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and LTM capabilities. We also found that the development of the clock (DN1a) -arousal (Dh44) circuit is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. The emergence of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae is advantageous as it enables long-term memory capabilities at the L3 stage.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study reveals that nutritional status plays a crucial role in driving the development of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae. The identification of Dh44 neurons as nutrient sensors that regulate food consumption and starvation-induced sleep suppression provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of sleep and feeding behaviors in developing organisms. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of circadian rhythms and the development of sleep disorders in humans.

    **Title:** Energetic Benefits of Collective Movement in Fish Schools: A Comparative Study of Aerobic and Anaerobic Metabolic Costs

    **Research Question:** Do fish schools exhibit reduced energetic costs of locomotion compared to solitary individuals, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We conducted an experimental study on giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) fish, measuring both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools and solitary individuals over a wide range of water velocities (0.3-8.0 body lengths s-1).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that fish schools exhibit a concave upward shaped metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length s-1. We found that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish, with a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and 65% less non-aerobic energy use at maximum sustained swimming speed. This led to a 53% reduction in TEE and total cost of transport, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Additionally, fish in schools recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that fish schools can significantly reduce the energetic costs of locomotion, particularly at high speeds, by increasing maximum aerobic performance and conserving anaerobic energy. This energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes, allowing them to evade predators more effectively.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides direct evidence for the energetic benefits of collective movement in fish schools, demonstrating that group movement can be a more energy-efficient biological collective than movement by isolated individuals. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution and ecology of schooling behavior in aquatic animals, and highlight the importance of considering both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic costs in studies of animal locomotion.

    **Title:** Metabolic Reprogramming and Functional Plasticity of Human Airway Macrophages in Response to IFN-γ and IL-4 Priming

    **Research Question:** What is the metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of human airway macrophages (AM) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in response to IFN-γ and IL-4 priming?

    **Methods:** Primary human AM and MDM were primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Metabolic flux was monitored by recording extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at baseline for 30 minutes. Cytokine secretion was measured after stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS.

    **Main Findings:** Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM, which shifted to a "Warburg"-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM, which was mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ-driven cytokine production in AM.

    **Implications:** These findings indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. The data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that human AM exhibit metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity in response to IFN-γ priming, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. These findings have significant implications for understanding the role of AM in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung, and highlight the potential for targeting AM with inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.

    Title: Nocturnal Bull Ants Use Polarised Moonlight for Overnight Navigation

    Research Question: Do nocturnal bull ants (Myrmecia midas) use polarised moonlight as a compass cue for navigation during the night?

    Methods: We conducted an experiment to investigate whether nocturnal bull ants use polarised moonlight for navigation. We rotated the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants and observed their heading changes in response.

    Main Findings: Our results show that nocturnal bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night. We demonstrate that these ants can detect polarised moonlight throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Furthermore, we show that the ants incorporate polarised moonlight into their path integration system throughout the night, similar to how they use polarised sunlight during the day.

    Implications: This study provides the first evidence that any animal uses polarised moonlight for navigation. Our findings suggest that polarised moonlight is a detectable cue for nocturnal insects, including nocturnal bees and crickets, which have been theorised to use this ability. The incorporation of polarised moonlight into the ants' path integration system indicates that this cue is likely processed through the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that nocturnal bull ants use polarised moonlight as a compass cue for navigation during the night. This ability allows them to navigate home even when the sun is obscured by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. The long-term incorporation of polarised moonlight into the ants' path integration system suggests that this cue is an essential component of their navigation strategy. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the visual ecology of nocturnal insects and highlight the importance of polarised light as a navigational cue in the natural world.

**Title:** Unveiling the Aerodynamic Secrets of Early Pterosaurs: A Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence Imaging Study

**Research Question:** How did early pterosaurs maintain the stiffness of their tail vanes, a crucial structure for flight control and aerodynamic efficiency?

**Methods:** We employed Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) imaging to examine the tail vanes of over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under LSF, revealing a previously unknown cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that the lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system, which maintained vane stiffness and allowed the tail to augment flight control. This system enabled the vane to function as a display structure, potentially used for communication or mating purposes. The lattice's presence explains how early pterosaurs overcame the aerodynamic challenges posed by vane fluttering, which would have compromised flight control and efficiency.

**Implications:** The discovery of the cross-linking lattice in early pterosaur tail vanes sheds new light on the evolution of flight in vertebrates. Our findings suggest that the loss of vanes in later pterosaurs and their absence in birds and bats may be related to the development of alternative flight control mechanisms. The lattice's presence also highlights the importance of tail morphology in early pterosaurs, which may have played a crucial role in their ability to achieve powered flight.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of LSF imaging in revealing the intricate details of fossilized structures. The discovery of the cross-linking lattice in early pterosaur tail vanes provides new insights into the evolution of flight in vertebrates and highlights the importance of tail morphology in early pterosaurs. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the aerodynamics of flight and the evolution of vertebrate flight capabilities.

    **Title:** Age-Dependent Regulation of Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens Core of Male Rats

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying the age-dependent differences in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of male rats during adolescence and adulthood?

    **Methods:** We utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release in the NAc core of adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. We also investigated the role of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and GABA signaling in modulating dopamine release.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show baseline differences in dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nAChR on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release. This effect is driven, in part, by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release only in adolescent male rats, through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the age-dependent differences in dopamine release in the NAc core of male rats. The results suggest that the α6 nAChR and GABA signaling play a critical role in regulating dopamine release during adolescence, and that this regulation is unique to this developmental stage. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the transition from adolescence to adulthood and the increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders during this period.

    **Title:** Shared Pathogenic Mechanism of mTOR Signaling Dysregulation in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Subtypes

    **Background:** Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical and etiological features. Despite this heterogeneity, recent studies suggest that shared pathogenic mechanisms may underlie the disorder.

    **Research Question:** Do genetically distinct ASD subtypes share common defects in neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration, and if so, what signaling pathways contribute to these developmental defects?

    **Methods:** We conducted an unbiased phospho-proteome screen on iPSC-derived NPCs from two distinct ASD subtypes: idiopathic (I-ASD) and 16p11.2 deletion (16pDel). We also performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify genetic overlap between the datasets.

    **Main Findings:** Our studies reveal that both ASD subtypes exhibit common reductions in NPC neurite outgrowth and migration, despite no genetic overlap between the datasets. An unbiased phospho-proteome screen identified hundreds of shared phospho-peptides, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes share common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration, driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. Altered cellular signaling appears to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of mTOR signaling in the development of ASD and suggests that mTOR dysregulation may be a common feature among multiple forms of ASD. These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted therapies for ASD and other NDDs. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of mTOR signaling in ASD pathogenesis and to explore the potential of mTOR modulation as a therapeutic strategy.
Title: Synaptic Heterogeneity in Inner Hair Cells Contributes to the Diversity of Spontaneous and Sound-Evoked Firing of Spiral Ganglion Neurons

    Abstract:
    The neural diversity of the cochlea, particularly in the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity in the cochlea. Using ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons, we found that synapses with high spontaneous release rates (SR) were predominantly located on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses exhibited larger and more temporally compact spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. Our results indicate that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

    Methods:
    We performed paired IHC and SGN bouton recordings in acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice, using stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic in vivo SGN characterization. This approach allowed us to tightly control IHC Ca2+ influx and record the postsynaptic SGN response to glutamate release at a single afferent synapse.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that high SR synapses on the pillar side of the IHC have distinct physiological properties, including larger and more temporally compact EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. These findings suggest that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

    Implications:
    Our study provides experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology, bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding. The results highlight the importance of synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea, which may be a key mechanism for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural diversity of the cochlea and the mechanisms of sound encoding. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity in the cochlea.

    **Title:** Essential Role of PfMORC in Chromatin Structure and Gene Regulation in Plasmodium falciparum

    **Research Question:** What is the role of PfMORC in chromatin structure and gene regulation in Plasmodium falciparum, and is it essential for parasite survival?

    **Methods:** We employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq), and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies to investigate the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC in Plasmodium falciparum.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that PfMORC modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, and is essential for parasite survival. ChIP-seq experiments revealed that PfMORC binds to sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by Hi-C studies showed that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure, leading to parasite death.

    **Implications:** These findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies. The essentiality of PfMORC for parasite survival and its role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation, provide new insights into the biology of Plasmodium falciparum.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of PfMORC in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum. The use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and complementary molecular and genomics approaches has provided a comprehensive understanding of PfMORC's role in the parasite's lifecycle. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel antimalarial strategies targeting PfMORC, which could potentially lead to the discovery of new treatments for malaria.

    **Title:** Tumor-Infiltrating Nerves Contribute to Cancer-Associated Changes in Brain Function and Behavior

    **Research Question:** Do nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to changes in mental health in cancer patients by impacting brain functions?

    **Methods:** We used a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing to investigate the connection between tumor-infiltrating nerves and brain functions. We examined the activation of neuronal circuitry, behavioral alterations, and the role of nociceptor neurons in mediating these changes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas, including the trigeminal ganglion (TGM) and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpVc). The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors, including decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running. Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity, and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos expression and increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior, independently of pain. This cancer-brain circuit drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice, and the elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients.

    **Conclusions:** Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is crucial for developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer. Our study demonstrates that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit that influences behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. These findings have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cancer-associated changes in mental health and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer patients and survivors.

    **Title:** Investigating the Impact of Mutations on the Biophysical Phenotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein

    **Research Question:** How do mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences affect the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of SARS-CoV-2, and what are the implications for viral evolution?

    **Methods:** We leveraged the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 to examine the impact of mutations on the biophysical properties of the N-protein, focusing on its extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). We conducted biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, including the Omicron variant. We also computationally evaluated the range of biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum, as well as related coronaviruses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that variation in the physicochemical parameters of the IDRs is sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. We found that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, including the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, particularly in the IDRs. This implies that the charge properties and phosphorylation, like polarity and hydrophobicity, of the equivalent IDR sub-regions are functional biophysical constraints maintained across related coronaviruses despite little sequence conservation. The extensive genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 presents an opportunity to probe how sequence diversity impacts these biophysical properties, and to examine what biophysical constraints exist for viral proteins to support viability.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of the many N-protein functions and the biophysical fitness landscape underlying evolution. The large biophysical parameter space available for viable N-protein endows viral protein IDRs with yet another level of variation of the biophysical phenotype that can impact evolutionary fitness. Exploiting the emerging mutational landscape and sequence space presents both a challenge and opportunity to explore the biophysical phenotype spectrum and uncover the salient functional principles of RNA-virus proteins.

    **Title:** Remodeling of Myosin Metabolic States in Hibernating Mammals: Implications for Energy Utilization

    **Research Question:** Do skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization in small and large mammal species?

    **Methods:** We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus) and large hibernators (Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus) and conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. We also performed multiple proteomics analyses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, while in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor led to higher levels of energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures (20°C). However, upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8°C (near the body temperature of torpid animals), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that myosin is further altered in response to cold exposure, highlighting myosin as a potential contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the remodeling of myosin metabolic states in hibernating mammals is a key adaptation to optimize energy utilization during periods of torpor. The preservation of myosin structure in large hibernators and the reduction of myosin ATP consumption in small hibernators at lower temperatures suggest that myosin plays a crucial role in regulating energy expenditure during hibernation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hibernation and have implications for our understanding of energy metabolism in mammals.

    **Title:** Modulation of Division Plane Rotation Regulates the Formation of Chondrocyte Clusters and Columns in the Growth Plate

    **Research Question:** How do chondrocyte clusters and columns form in the growth plate, and what is their role in bone elongation during embryonic and postnatal development?

    **Methods:** We analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in the growth plates of mouse embryos and postnatal mice using 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, our analysis revealed that most cells in the embryonic growth plate did not display complete rotation of the division plane, resulting in non-stereotypic cell stacking and the formation of elongated clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. In postnatal mice, we observed both complex columns composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges of the growth plate.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determine the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development. Our results highlight the importance of 3D analysis in understanding complex cellular arrangements and suggest that the formation of chondrocyte clusters and columns is a multifunctional process that regulates bone growth throughout development. The findings of this study have broad implications for our understanding of bone development and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for bone-related disorders.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Proton-Coupled Oligopeptide Transporters: A Molecular Dynamics Study of SLC15A2

    Abstract:
    Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) play a crucial role in the oral bioavailability of various classes of drugs. Despite recent advances in cryo-EM structures and alphafold models, the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling in mammalian POTs remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map out the full conformational cycle of SLC15A2, a mammalian POT. Our results reveal a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access, shedding light on the mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition. Notably, our simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, validated experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Furthermore, our constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, providing crucial insights into secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals, paving the way for integrating knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

    Research Question:
    What is the mechanism of proton-coupled oligopeptide transport in mammalian POTs, specifically SLC15A2?

    Methods:
    We employed extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD simulations to map out the full conformational cycle of SLC15A2. We computed conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, using a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides. We also performed constant-PH MD and ABFE calculations to establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition.

    Main Findings:
    Our simulations reveal a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access in SLC15A2. We identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, validated experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, providing crucial insights into secondary active transport in POTs.

    Implications:
    This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals, paving the way for integrating knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs, shedding light on the mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition. Our results have significant implications for the design of drugs that target tissue and organ bioavailability, and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanism of proton-coupled oligopeptide transport in mammals.

    **Title:** Auditory Suppression and Sensitivity to Feedback in Human Speech Monitoring

    **Research Question:** Does speech-induced auditory suppression in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) increase sensitivity to auditory feedback in humans, enabling the detection and correction of speech errors?

    **Methods:** We employed intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production to investigate the relationship between auditory suppression and sensitivity to feedback. We first characterized the topography of auditory suppression across the STG and then used a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results revealed that overlapping sites in the STG exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures. We found that delaying auditory feedback during speech production enhanced auditory responses in the STG, and the degree of sensitivity to feedback delays was variable across different recording sites. Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between speech-induced suppression and feedback sensitivity, providing evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring.

    **Implications:** Our findings support the hypothesis that speech-induced auditory suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in humans, enabling the detection and correction of speech errors. The results suggest that auditory suppression is a key mechanism underlying speech monitoring, and that increased attention to auditory feedback under adverse speaking conditions can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first direct evidence for a link between auditory suppression and sensitivity to feedback in human speech monitoring. Our results have important implications for understanding the neural basis of speech production and monitoring, and may inform the development of novel treatments for speech disorders. The use of iEEG recordings in neurosurgical participants allowed for a level of spatial detail and temporal precision that would not be possible with non-invasive techniques, providing a unique insight into the neural mechanisms underlying human speech processing.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of Coiled-Coil Nuclease Tandems (CoCoNuTs): A Novel Branch of Prokaryotic Type IV Restriction Systems

    **Research Question:** What are the characteristics and genomic associations of Coiled-Coil Nuclease Tandems (CoCoNuTs), a previously uncharacterized branch of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems?

    **Methods:** A comprehensive census of McrBC systems was conducted, followed by phylogenetic analysis to reveal the enormous abundance of CoCoNuTs in diverse prokaryotes. We identified three distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoCoNuTs, characterized by the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases.

    **Main Findings:** CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds, YTH-like domains, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, suggesting that these systems target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs may also target DNA via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides or RNA fragments with cyclic termini that bind associated CARF domains.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that CoCoNuTs, together with ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. This strategy involves an initial immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA, followed by an abortive infection response leading to programmed cell death (PCD) or dormancy via host RNA cleavage if the initial response fails.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of CoCoNuTs reveals a novel branch of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems with extraordinary variety and complexity. Our results provide insights into the evolution and function of these systems, which may employ a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of CoCoNuTs and their role in prokaryotic defense against viral infections.
Title: Calcineurin Regulates Innate Immunity and Lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans through the Rhythmic Defecation Motor Program

    Abstract:
    Background: Calcineurin is a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways. Despite its diverse functions, the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity and lifespan remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity and lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, and how does it interact with other signaling pathways?

    Methods: We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, tax-6, in C. elegans and examined the effects on innate immunity and lifespan. We also investigated the relationship between calcineurin activity and the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP).

    Main Findings: We discovered that calcineurin is required for the C. elegans DMP, and its inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We also found that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. Furthermore, we identified the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, and the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, as key regulators of lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition.

    Implications: Our study provides new insights into the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity and lifespan in C. elegans. The findings suggest that calcineurin plays a critical role in the DMP, which is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing bacterial infection. The discovery of HLH-30 and NHR-8 as key regulators of lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition highlights the complex interplay between calcineurin, innate immunity, and lifespan.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which calcineurin regulates innate immunity and lifespan in C. elegans through the DMP. The findings have important implications for understanding the relationship between calcineurin, innate immunity, and lifespan, and may shed light on the complex interplay between these processes in other organisms.

**Title:** Resolving Conflicts in Cognitive Control: A Cognitive Space Theory Perspective

**Research Question:** How do cognitive control processes effectively address diverse conflicts arising from different sources, such as sensory input and internal representations, to enable goal-directed behavior?

**Methods:** We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized to test the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation. Human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were measured to investigate whether different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity.

**Main Findings:** Our results support the hypothesis that conflicts similar in their sources are represented similarly in the cognitive space. The distance between points in the cognitive space, reflecting the geometry of the cognitive space, scales with the difference in the sources of the conflicts being represented by the points. The dimensions in the cognitive space of conflicts can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates, reflecting how much control is needed for each of the domain-specific cognitive control processes.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the cognitive space theory provides a principled framework for representing conflicts, which can be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions. This theory implies that different types of conflicts can be represented conjunctively in a single cognitive space to achieve domain-general cognitive control.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the cognitive space representing different types of conflicts is located in the frontoparietal network, which is essential for conflict resolution. We propose two solutions to resolving different conflict types: domain-general cognitive control theories, which posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts, and domain-specific cognitive control theories, which suggest that the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and conflict resolution, with implications for the development of more effective cognitive training programs and interventions.

    Title: Longitudinal Profiling of the Vaginal Immunoproteome in Pregnant Women at Risk for Spontaneous Preterm Birth

    Background: Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite its significant impact, the prediction of sPTB remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response.

    Research Question: Can the vaginal immunoproteome, a network of immune mediators in vaginal fluid, predict spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) in pregnant women at high risk?

    Methods: We conducted the largest longitudinal investigation of the vaginal immunoproteome in a population at high risk for sPTB. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL), or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations.

    Main Findings: Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile. However, the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM. This inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides.

    Implications: The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks) sPTB. The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation, and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes.

    Conclusions: This study represents the largest and most comprehensive profiling of the soluble immune response in vaginal fluid throughout well-characterized pregnancies. Our findings highlight the importance of the vaginal immunoproteome in predicting sPTB and suggest its potential as a biomarker for early sPTB. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the clinical utility of the vaginal immunoproteome in predicting and preventing sPTB.

**Title:** Sex-Specific Differences in Arterial Myocytes: A Novel Computational Model of Electrical and Ca2+ Signaling

**Research Question:** What are the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling in male and female arterial myocytes, and how do these differences impact the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure?

**Methods:** We developed an in silico model, the Hernandez-Hernandez model, which integrates new experimental data on sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential, as well as local and global [Ca2+]i signaling in male and female myocytes.

**Main Findings:** Our simulations suggest that the KV1.5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes, while KV2.1 channels play a primary role in controlling membrane potential in female myocytes. We also found that the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels drives sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability. Furthermore, our idealized computational model of a vessel predicts that female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male.

**Implications:** The Hernandez-Hernandez model provides a new framework for investigating the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs. Our results suggest that KV2.1 channels play a critical role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes, and that clinically used antihypertensive CaV1.2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in CaV1.2 currents in female than in male arterial myocytes.

**Conclusions:** The Hernandez-Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in CaV1.2 and KV2.1 channels in regulating membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes. Our findings have significant implications for the development of sex-specific antihypertensive therapies and highlight the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in vascular function.

    **Title:** Decomposer Size and Climate Interactions Shape Litter Decomposition Across Aridity Gradients

    **Research Question:** How do decomposers of varying sizes respond to precipitation levels along a sharp aridity gradient, and what are the implications for litter decomposition rates?

    **Methods:** We conducted a field experiment in which plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes were placed in seven sites along a precipitation gradient spanning from 22 to 526 mm mean annual precipitation. Decomposers were characterized using pitfall trapping, and litter decomposition rates were measured over two seasons.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that decomposers respond differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter, while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient, except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum. The opposing climatic dependencies of micro- and macro-decomposers lead to similar or even higher annual decomposition rates in arid sites compared to those measured in more mesic sites.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that decomposer size is a critical factor in shaping litter decomposition rates across aridity gradients. The hump-shaped response of macro-decomposers to precipitation, peaking in arid environments, suggests that macro-decomposition governs plant litter decomposition in deserts. Our results emphasize the need to consider decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes and highlight the importance of macro-decomposers in arid ecosystems. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between climate, decomposers, and litter decomposition, with implications for our understanding of ecosystem functioning in arid-lands.
Title: Elucidating the Role of CYRI-B in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Novel Mediator of Growth, Signaling, and Metastasis

    Abstract:

    Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease characterized by high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. The hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all PDAC tumors drives RAC1 activation, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity, as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis, a nutrient scavenging mechanism, has been poorly understood in the context of signaling receptor trafficking. We investigated the role of CYRI-B, a protein highly expressed in PDAC, in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Our results show that deletion of Cyrib, the gene encoding CYRI-B, accelerates tumorigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions. However, as the disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. We found that CYRI-B-depleted tumor cells exhibit reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Our study implicates CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in PDAC, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

    Methods: We used a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer (KPC model) to investigate the role of CYRI-B in PDAC. We assessed the expression of CYRI-B in the KPC model and evaluated the effects of Cyrib deletion on tumorigenesis and metastasis. We also examined the localization of CYRI-B on macropinosomes in pancreatic cancer cell lines.

    Main Findings: Our results show that CYRI-B is highly expressed in human PDAC and correlates with poorer survival. Deletion of Cyrib in the KPC model accelerates PanIN formation and progression, likely due to the loss of CYRI-B's capacity to buffer RAC1 activation downstream of active KRAS. However, as the disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. We found that CYRI-B-depleted tumor cells exhibit reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1.

    Implications: Our study provides new insights into the role of CYRI-B in PDAC, highlighting its potential as a mediator of growth and signaling. The findings suggest that CYRI-B may serve as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages of PDAC, but its loss may inhibit metastasis as the disease progresses. These results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting CYRI-B in PDAC.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that CYRI-B plays a critical role in PDAC, influencing both tumorigenesis and metastasis. The identification of CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in PDAC provides new avenues for research into the development of targeted therapies for this devastating disease.

    **Title:** Recent Activity of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) in Rhesus Macaques: Implications for Virology and Pathogenesis

    **Research Question:** Are human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), specifically the HML-2 clade, still active in rhesus macaques, and if so, what are the implications for our understanding of viral evolution and pathogenesis?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the rhesus macaque genome to identify and characterize HML-2-like proviruses. We searched for HML-2 proviral sequences in the two most recent rhesus genome assemblies and performed in-depth characterization of their structure, coding capacity, and evolutionary history, with a focus on the SERV-K1-like proviruses.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions that show signs of recent or ongoing infectious activity. Notably, 106 of these proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K (HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM) but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We also identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons, indicating interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that rhesus macaques may harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses, which could serve as a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time and as a model for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for recent activity of HML-2-like retroviruses in rhesus macaques, which has significant implications for our understanding of viral evolution and pathogenesis. The identification of a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions and the presence of a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE) in the LTRs of the youngest proviruses indicate that the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism. These findings highlight the importance of further investigation into the virology and pathogenesis of HML-2-like retroviruses in rhesus macaques.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Enterococcus faecalis-Induced Wound Infections: A Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Study

    **Research Question:** What are the cellular and transcriptomic changes associated with Enterococcus faecalis infection in wounds, and how do these changes contribute to delayed or failed healing?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model, examining over 23,000 cells to create a comprehensive single-cell atlas.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections, suggesting that the bacterium induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. These insights from our scRNA-seq atlas provide a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds at 4 days post-infection. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat wound infections, particularly those caused by E. faecalis.

    **Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Volatile-Mediated Priming and Induction of Plant Defenses in Response to Herbivore-Attacked Neighbors

    **Research Question:** What are the temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants, and how do these responses integrate priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern?

    **Methods:** We employed a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system to investigate the temporal dynamics of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We exposed receiver plants to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles from sender plants under attack by Spodoptera exigua caterpillars.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independently of day-night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real-time as they perceive the dynamic natural volatile blend of herbivore-attacked neighbors. We propose that responding most strongly to volatile cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure, and that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived the next day.

Title: Recursive Vocal Combinatorics in Wild Orangutans: Implications for the Evolution of Recursion in Human Language

Research Question: Do wild orangutans exhibit recursive vocal combinatorics, and if so, what are the implications for the evolution of recursion in human language?

Methods: We conducted a structural analysis of the long calls of flanged male orangutans in the wild, using precise rhythm analysis techniques (De Gregorio et al., 2022; Lameira et al., 2013a) to identify recursive self-embedded vocal patterning.

Main Findings: We found that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. Notably, three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples, suggesting that these recursive structures were not the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances.

Implications: Our findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. This discovery opens the intriguing possibility that recursive vocal combinatorics were first and foremost a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later recruited and ‘re-engineered’ for the generation of linguistic combinatorics.

Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for recursive self-embedded vocal patterning in a nonhuman great ape, namely, in the long calls of flanged orangutan males in the wild. This finding suggests that recursive vocal combinatorics may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. Future studies probing for recursive call sequence patterns in other orangutan vocal contexts and other great ape vocal behaviors could help test this idea. A structural approach to recursive vocal combinatorics in wild primates offers promising new paths to empirically assess possible precursors and proto-states for the evolution of recursion within the hominid family.

    **Title:** Co-evolutionary Arms Race between MDA5 Receptor and 5’ppp-RNA Virus in Lower Vertebrates

    **Research Question:** How do lower vertebrates, such as fish and birds, compensate for the loss of the RIG-I receptor, a key component of the innate immune system, by evolving alternative immune strategies to recognize and respond to 5’ppp-RNA viruses?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrates Miichthys miiuy (miiuy croaker) and Gallus gallus (chicken), which lack the RIG-I receptor. We analyzed the MDA5-mediated signaling pathway in response to SCRV virus and double-stranded mimetic poly(I:C)-HMW infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus can recognize and respond to 5’ppp-RNA viruses, suggesting that MDA5 has evolved alternative functions to compensate for the loss of RIG-I. Furthermore, we found that SCRV virus can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5, weakening its antiviral immune ability and promoting its own replication and immune evasion.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the co-evolutionary arms race between vertebrates and viruses, highlighting the importance of MDA5 as a key component of the innate immune system in lower vertebrates. The loss of RIG-I in vertebrates is a widespread event, and our research suggests that MDA5 has evolved to compensate for this loss, providing a new perspective on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the interaction between MDA5 and 5’ppp-RNA virus is a critical aspect of the co-evolutionary arms race between vertebrates and viruses. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of the immune system and the development of new strategies to combat viral infections in vertebrates.
Title: Correlating Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Serum Levels with Body Composition and Bone Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)

    Abstract:

    Background: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has extragonadal effects on body composition and bone metabolism. Given the profound impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on circulating FSH concentrations, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between FSH serum levels and body composition parameters, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers in prostate cancer (PC) patients undergoing ADT.

    Methods: Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic PC patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019. Patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. Body composition parameters, including fat body mass (FBM), lean body mass (LBM), and BMD, were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

    Results: At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms (r = 0.36) and legs (r = 0.33). Conversely, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM (r = 0.52, p = 0.006), fat mass at arms (r = 0.54, p = 0.004), and fat mass at trunk (r = 0.45, p = 0.018) assessed after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed (r = -0.64, p = 0.001).

    Implications: This study suggests that FSH serum levels after ADT may have an impact on body composition, particularly on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT.

    Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into the relationship between FSH serum levels and body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. The findings suggest that FSH may play a role in the changes in body composition induced by ADT. Further research is needed to confirm these results and explore the potential clinical applications of FSH as a biomarker for body composition changes in PC patients.
Title: Inhibition of Sarcoplasmic Ryanodine Receptor 2 Reduces Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation and Sudden Cardiac Death in a Guinea Pig Model of Nonischemic Heart Failure

    Abstract:
    Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) remains a leading cause of mortality, despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels. Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels contribute to the pathophysiology of SCD. We investigated the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD, and improves contractile function in a guinea pig model of nonischemic heart failure (HF).

    Methods:
    We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, including a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene (DS) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation.

    Main Findings:
    DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigated the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improved contractile function.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene may be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing VT/VF/SCD in nonischemic HF. The potential life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, including clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.

    Conclusions:
    Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD, and improves contractile function in a guinea pig model of nonischemic HF. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of SCD and highlight the potential of RyR2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing VT/VF/SCD in nonischemic HF.

    **Title:** SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri Mediate Complex Transcriptional Responses to TGF-β Family Ligands in C. elegans

    **Research Question:** How do SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri transcription factors regulate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the TGF-β family in C. elegans?

    **Methods:** We employed genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integrated through a novel software analysis pipeline to investigate the roles of SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri transcription factors in the developing C. elegans larva. We chose the second larval (L2) stage, where Smad activity is elevated, as determined by the RAD-SMAD activity reporter.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri have target genes that are co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate target genes that they independently and exclusively regulate. ChIP-seq data demonstrated that 73.7% of SMA-3 binding peaks overlap with SMA-9 binding sites, while approximately half of all SMA-9 binding sites did not overlap with SMA-3 sites. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size regulation for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation. The identification of SMA-9-exclusive target genes implies Smad-independent roles for SMA-9 in functions such as immunity, consistent with the pronounced role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the complex transcriptional responses of SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri to TGF-β family ligands in C. elegans. Our findings challenge the prevailing model for Schnurri function and highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in regulating developmental processes.

    **Title:** DUX4 Expression in Metastatic Cancers: A Novel Biomarker and Therapeutic Target for Checkpoint Immunotherapy Resistance

    **Research Question:** Does the embryonic transcription factor DUX4 contribute to cancer immune evasion and checkpoint immunotherapy failure in metastatic cancers?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a large cohort of patients with metastatic bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers for DUX4 expression and its association with immune cell exclusion and response to PD-L1 blockade. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantify PD-L1 levels in the tumor and immune compartments.

    **Main Findings:** We found that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with 10-50% of advanced cancers expressing DUX4. DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in urothelial carcinoma patients. Furthermore, DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival, with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year, even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that DUX4 expression is a key driver of immune evasion in metastatic cancers, contributing to checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. The high rates of DUX4 expression observed across metastatic cancer cohorts indicate that DUX4 could be a useful biomarker for identifying patients who are unlikely to respond to PD-L1 blockade.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of DUX4 as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance in metastatic cancers. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms governing DUX4 de-repression in cancer and to develop DUX4-targeting therapies for the treatment of metastatic cancers. Our findings have significant implications for the development of more effective immunotherapies for patients with metastatic cancers.
Title: Investigating the Aetiology of Livestock Abortion in Tanzania: A Surveillance Platform for Improving Livestock Productivity and Public Health

    Abstract:

    Background: Livestock abortion is a significant disease syndrome affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. Despite its importance, there is a lack of data on the aetiology of livestock abortion, hindering effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health.

    Research Question: What are the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in Tanzania, and can a surveillance platform be established to investigate and inform interventions?

    Methods: A surveillance platform was established in Tanzania to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers (LFOs) and investigated by research teams. Samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate determinants of attribution, patterns of events, determinants of reporting, investigation, and attribution, and cases involving zoonotic pathogens.

    Main Findings: Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated. Attribution was achieved for 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection.

    Implications: This study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection, and application of molecular diagnostic platforms. Livestock abortion surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses, and identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance. An effective reporting and investigation system can be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas. The findings of this study support the establishment of a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa.

    **Title:** Nicotine Regulates Intestinal Stem Cell Proliferation and Tumorigenicity via α7-nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch Signaling

    **Background:** Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases, including colon cancer. Nicotine, the major constituent of cigarette smoke, has been implicated in the regulation of stem cell functions, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** Does nicotine regulate intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and tumorigenicity via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of nicotine on ISC proliferation and tumorigenicity in vivo and ex vivo using murine models. We also examined the role of α7-nAchR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling in nicotine-induced ISC proliferation and tumorigenicity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that nicotine increases the abundance and proliferative activity of ISCs in vivo and ex vivo. We also found that nicotine induces Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nAchR and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, but not in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of nicotine on ISCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nicotine enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, and DBZ inhibited nicotine-induced tumor growth.

    **Implications:** Our study identifies a nicotine-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings reveal the pivotal role of nicotine as a stimulant of cancer stem cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, explaining colon cancer development in cigarette smokers. The development of drugs that can block α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers. This study contributes to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggests an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.
Title: Elucidating the Collaborative Impact of Hsp110 and J-Domain Proteins on Hsp70-Dependent Aggregate Processing

    Abstract:
    The Hsp70 chaperone system plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which are associated with stress, aging, and disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of co-chaperones, including J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs), in regulating Hsp70 activity. Here, we investigate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes on Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. Our results demonstrate that Hsp110 plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining the final efficacy of the process. We show that Hsp110 stimulates the recruitment of Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surfaces, modifying aggregates into smaller species that are more readily processed by chaperones. Notably, Hsp110's stimulation of Hsp70 is stronger with class B JDPs than class A JDPs, and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we reveal that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction, which may improve disaggregation but also lead to inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Our findings emphasize the importance of a balanced interplay between co-chaperones and Hsp70 to unlock its disaggregating potential.

    Research Question:
    How do Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes collaborate to regulate Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing?

    Methods:
    We employed a combination of biochemical and biophysical assays to investigate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 and JDPs on Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Hsp110 stimulates the recruitment of Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surfaces, modifying aggregates into smaller species that are more readily processed by chaperones. We also demonstrate that Hsp110's stimulation of Hsp70 is stronger with class B JDPs than class A JDPs, and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we reveal that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction, which may improve disaggregation but also lead to inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the importance of a balanced interplay between co-chaperones and Hsp70 to unlock its disaggregating potential. The results suggest that Hsp110 plays a critical role in the initial stages of disaggregation, and that its stimulation of Hsp70 is stronger with class B JDPs than class A JDPs. The disruption of the JDP-Hsp70 interaction by Hsp110 may improve disaggregation, but also lead to inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the collaborative impact of Hsp110 and JDPs on Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. The results emphasize the importance of a balanced interplay between co-chaperones and Hsp70 to unlock its disaggregating potential, and highlight the critical role of Hsp110 in the initial stages of disaggregation.

    **Title:** Wearable Digital Insoles for Objective Gait Analysis in Knee Arthropathy: A Machine Learning Approach

    **Research Question:** Can wearable digital insoles accurately measure osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures and identify individuals with knee arthropathy using machine learning algorithms?

    **Methods:** We developed a machine learning model trained on force plate data collected from participants with knee arthropathy and controls. The model was then validated using a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the machine learning model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROC] = 0.86; area under the precision-recall curve [auPR] = 0.90) and of a separate, independent digital insole dataset (auROC = 0.83; auPR = 0.86). Furthermore, we demonstrated that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods, which are often limited by expensive equipment, large-scale facilities, and highly trained staff. The use of wearable digital insoles has the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring, particularly for individuals with musculoskeletal conditions such as knee arthropathy.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that wearable digital insoles can accurately measure osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures and identify individuals with knee arthropathy using machine learning algorithms. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines and supports the clinical development of at-home gait assessments. The use of digital insoles has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and monitoring of musculoskeletal conditions, enabling more frequent and comprehensive assessments, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

    **Title:** Human Amniotic Membrane-Derived Biologics as Non-Opioid Therapies for Post-Surgical Pain

    **Research Question:** Can human amniotic membrane-derived biologics, such as Clarix Flo (FLO) and its purified component, heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3), be used as effective non-opioid treatments for post-surgical pain?

    **Methods:** In this study, we investigated the analgesic effects of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 on post-surgical pain in mice. We used a plantar-incision model to induce pain hypersensitivity and evaluated the effects of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 on nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We also used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that local application of FLO attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity in mice without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive DRG neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified HC-HA/PTX3 from human amniotic membrane and found that it replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. The identification of HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition suggests that it may be a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that human amniotic membrane-derived biologics, such as FLO and HC-HA/PTX3, can be used as effective non-opioid treatments for post-surgical pain. The underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 involve CD44-dependent pathways and cytoskeleton rearrangements that inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons. These findings have significant implications for the development of non-opioid therapies for post-surgical pain.

    **Title:** Investigating the Correlation between Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) Cell Pigmentation and Gene Expression in Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived RPE Cells (iPSC-RPE)

    **Research Question:** Do the levels of pigmentation in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells (iPSC-RPE) correlate with their gene expression profiles at the single-cell level?

    **Methods:** We utilized our Automated Live Imaging and Cell Picking System (ALPS) to photograph each iPSC-RPE cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. We categorized iPSC-RPE cells into four clusters based on gene expression and analyzed the correlation between color intensity and gene expression profiles.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells does not project any specific gene expression profiles. We found a weak correlation between the color intensity and the expression levels of genes related to retinoid recycling, which is an important feature of RPE cells. The correlation coefficients for genes such as RDH11, BCO1, RDH10, DHRS3, and RDH5 were 0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.11, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the color of iPSC-RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional characteristics. This is supported by previous studies showing that poorly pigmented stem cell-derived RPE cells can become highly pigmented when transplanted, and that iPSC-RPE cells can become heavily pigmented after engraftment.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells is not strongly correlated with their gene expression profiles. We propose that the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition that does not necessarily reflect their functional characteristics. These findings have important implications for the use of iPSC-RPE cells in regenerative medicine and highlight the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying RPE cell pigmentation.

    **Title:** MarmoAAP: A Novel Behavioral Apparatus for Investigating Cooperative Behaviors in Common Marmosets

    **Research Question:** Can a novel behavioral apparatus, MarmoAAP, be developed to study cooperative behaviors in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in a naturalistic setting, providing high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings?

    **Methods:** We designed and developed MarmoAAP, a modular and adaptable apparatus for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. The apparatus enables high-resolution behavioral data collection and integration with video and audio recordings, allowing for nuanced and comprehensive analyses of social interactions and cooperative behaviors.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. The apparatus provides a platform for investigating the neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors, enabling the examination of the intricate interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and cooperative interactions in common marmosets.

    **Implications:** MarmoAAP bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism. The apparatus and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while freely moving marmosets are engaged in tasks implemented by MarmoAAP, significantly increasing the number of trials available for analysis and ensuring ample statistical power when investigating the relationship between neural activity and behaviors.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that MarmoAAP is a significant contribution to the study of marmoset social behaviors in the field. The combination of a highly modular and adaptable design, high-resolution behavioral data, and integration with neural recordings positions our paradigm as a robust and versatile tool for unraveling the complexities of primate behavior. By leveraging MarmoAAP, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets, ultimately advancing our knowledge of primate cognition and social behavior.

    **Title:** Early Moderate Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Alters Genome Regulation in Offspring: Implications for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)

    **Research Question:** Does early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affect genome regulation in the developing offspring, and if so, what are the implications for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)?

    **Methods:** We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate PAE, simulating common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to assess CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol. We also conducted candidate gene testing of regions identified in prior studies as sensitive to early moderate PAE.

    **Main Findings:** Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential, indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) suggested that some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia.

    **Implications:** Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, highlighting a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions. A maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that early moderate PAE can alter genome regulation in the developing offspring, which may contribute to the development of FASD. Our findings suggest that maternal dietary interventions, such as a diet high in folate and choline, may mitigate some of the effects of PAE on DNA methylation. These results have important implications for the prevention and treatment of FASD.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of RNA Interference: An Intersecting Network of Regulators Governs Gene Silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Background:** RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for silencing genes in various organisms, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. While all genes are considered equivalent targets for RNAi, recent studies have revealed that loss of certain regulators of RNAi can selectively impair the silencing of specific genes.

    **Research Question:** How do differences in RNA metabolism and intersecting networks of regulators contribute to the selective silencing of genes in C. elegans?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 in RNAi-mediated gene silencing in C. elegans. We used quantitative models and exploratory simulations to analyze the interactions between these regulators and their impact on gene silencing.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that any two of RDE-10, MUT-16, and NRDE-3 are required for silencing the somatic gene unc-22, but each protein is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. Notably, the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. We also found that changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, and that animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that an intersecting network of regulators governs RNAi-mediated gene silencing in C. elegans, and that differences in RNA metabolism contribute to the selective silencing of genes. These results have implications for the development of RNAi-based therapies in humans and other organisms.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of RNAi and highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between regulators and target genes in RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Future studies are needed to test each aspect of our model and to explore the potential applications of RNAi in various organisms.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Tuberculous Meningitis Mortality: A Whole-Genome Transcriptome Analysis

    **Background:** Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a severe and life-threatening complication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Despite its high mortality rate, the underlying mechanisms of TBM pathogenesis remain poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality, and to determine the best predictors of death in Vietnamese adults with TBM, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and healthy controls.

    **Methods:** Whole-blood RNA sequencing was performed on 281 TBM patients, 295 PTB patients, and 30 healthy controls. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality. Multivariate elastic-net Cox regression was employed to select candidate predictors of death, followed by logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose the best predictors.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed distinct patterns of gene expression associated with TBM mortality in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were linked to TBM mortality. In HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes (MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4) were identified as strong predictors of TBM mortality.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight critical genes and pathways related to TBM mortality, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets. The study also identified a four-gene signature as a novel biomarker for predicting outcomes in TBM patients, regardless of HIV status.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TBM pathogenesis and mortality. The identification of key genes and pathways associated with TBM mortality has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for predicting outcomes in TBM patients.

    **Title:** Assessing the Performance of Commercial Antibodies for Human Proteins: A Scalable Characterization Approach

    **Research Question:** What is the scope of the problem of commercial antibodies failing to recognize their intended targets, and what is the feasibility of achieving at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in the human proteome?

    **Methods:** We developed a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins. We evaluated the antibodies in three common applications: Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunofluorescence (IF).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, yet approximately 50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on the application. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Notably, hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were used in a large number of published articles, highlighting the need for improved antibody characterization.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates the scale of the antibody specificity problem and suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome: mining the existing commercial antibody repertoire and using the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for the representation and comparison of antibody performance, an estimate of the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, and an assessment of the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods. Our results inform a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all human proteins and highlight the need for improved antibody characterization to ensure the accuracy and reliability of biomedical research. By making the raw data openly available, we contribute to the development of a comprehensive and standardized ecosystem to validate commercial antibodies.

    **Title:** A Novel Resource for Simultaneous Gene Expression Control in Drosophila: Combining GAL4/UAS with LexA and QF Systems

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a set of reagents that facilitate the combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system (LexA or QF) in various Drosophila tissues, enabling researchers to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal?

    **Methods:** We generated a set of over 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in in Drosophila larvae, focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. Using FLP/FRT recombination, we isolated fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown using new compatible shRNA vectors and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate the successful integration of the LexA and QF systems with the GAL4/UAS system in various Drosophila tissues. We have generated a set of stocks, vectors, and protocols that enable researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously.

    **Implications:** This resource will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to study inter-organ communication and other complex biological processes that require independent control of gene expression in multiple tissues. The availability of these reagents will accelerate research in fields such as developmental biology, neurobiology, and disease modeling.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a novel resource that combines the GAL4/UAS system with the LexA and QF systems, enabling researchers to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal. This resource will facilitate the study of complex biological processes and will be a valuable tool for the Drosophila research community.
Title: Identification of a Novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3-Dependent Signaling Pathway Regulating Mossy Fiber-CA3 Synapse Function

    Abstract:
    The transcription factor Bcl11b has been implicated in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we investigated the role of Bcl11b in regulating mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Our study reveals that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b, which regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C1ql2 exerts its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 (25b+). Disruption of the C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or deletion of Nrxn3 in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major aspects of the Bcl11b and C1ql2 mutant phenotypes. Our findings identify a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. This study contributes to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.

    Research Question:
    What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Bcl11b in regulating mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the role of Bcl11b in regulating mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. We generated mice with conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus and analyzed the effects on mossy fiber-CA3 synapse structure and function. We also performed in vitro experiments using primary hippocampal neurons to investigate the role of C1ql2 and Nrxn3 (25b+) in regulating synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation.

    Main Findings:
    Our study reveals that C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b, which regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. We also demonstrate that C1ql2 exerts its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 (25b+). Disruption of the C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or deletion of Nrxn3 in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major aspects of the Bcl11b and C1ql2 mutant phenotypes.

    Implications:
    Our findings identify a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. This study contributes to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Bcl11b in regulating mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. The identification of a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway highlights the importance of this pathway in controlling synaptic function and provides a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction.

    **Title:** Zinc-Finger Protein Sfp1 Regulates Transcription and mRNA Stability through Co-Transcriptional Binding

    **Research Question:** How does the zinc-finger protein Sfp1 communicate with the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries to regulate gene expression?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and biochemical assays to investigate the role of Sfp1 in transcriptional regulation and mRNA stability.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that Sfp1 can regulate transcription by binding to promoters and gene bodies, where it affects RNA polymerase II (Pol II) configuration, leading to dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Furthermore, we found that Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Sfp1 plays a crucial role in regulating the mRNA life cycle, from transcription to degradation. The co-transcriptional binding of Sfp1 to nascent RNA imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking following promoter recruitment. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and mRNA stability, highlighting the dual-role of zinc-finger proteins like Sfp1.

    **Title:** Developmentally Controlled Programmed Cell Death Regulates Fungal Accommodation in Arabidopsis Roots

    **Research Question:** How does developmentally controlled programmed cell death (dPCD) influence fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots?

    **Methods:** We investigated the connection between dPCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators, smb-3 and bfn1-1, were analyzed for their effects on colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica.

    **Main Findings:** Mutations of smb-3 and bfn1-1 increased colonization by S. indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. Reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the functional link between dPCD and microbial accommodation in roots. Our findings suggest that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization. We propose that some adapted microbes manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BFN1 downregulation by S. indica.

    **Title:** Mechanical Force Potentiates Exopher Extrusion from Proteostressed Neurons: Implications for Neurodegenerative Disease

    **Research Question:** What factors regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers, from proteostressed neurons, and how do these processes contribute to neurodegenerative disease?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of mechanical force in exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) using a combination of genetic, molecular, and behavioral approaches. We analyzed the production of exophers from the ALMR neuron, a proteostressed neuron in C. elegans, under various conditions, including genetic disruption of germline, sperm, oocytes, and egg/early embryo production.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mechanical force potentiates exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. We also found that filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid can enhance ALMR exopher production, suggesting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. This has significant implications for our understanding of neurodegenerative disease, as large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying exopher extrusion and its role in neurodegenerative disease.
Title: DKK3: A Novel Driver of Synaptic Defects and Memory Impairment in Alzheimer’s Disease

    Abstract:
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and synaptic loss, leading to cognitive decline. Recent studies have implicated the Wnt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of AD, with the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) emerging as a potential contributor to disease progression. Here, we investigate the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. Our findings reveal that DKK3 expression is upregulated in AD brains and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages of the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse models of AD, extracellular DKK3 levels are elevated, and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway and a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. Conversely, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice. Our results demonstrate that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways and identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD.

    Research Question: What is the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains?

    Methods: We used hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse models of AD to investigate the expression and function of DKK3. We also performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies to examine the effects of DKK3 on synapse number and memory.

    Main Findings: Our results show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in AD brains and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages of the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse models of AD, extracellular DKK3 levels are elevated, and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway and a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. Conversely, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that DKK3 is a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. The upregulation of DKK3 in AD brains and its accumulation at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques indicate that DKK3 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. The blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway by DKK3 may contribute to the loss of excitatory synapses, while the activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway may lead to an increase in inhibitory synapses.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies DKK3 as a key contributor to synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD and suggest that DKK3 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

    **Title:** Pyoverdines from Environmental Pseudomonas spp. as a Novel Class of Antibacterials against Human Opportunistic Pathogens

    **Research Question:** Can pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., exhibit antibacterial properties against human opportunistic pathogens by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest?

    **Methods:** We conducted a screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, to identify pyoverdines with high antibacterial properties. We then elucidated the chemical structure of the most promising pyoverdine candidates to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Furthermore, pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and exhibited low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that pyoverdines from environmental Pseudomonas spp. have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens. The ability of pyoverdines to induce iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens makes them an attractive alternative to traditional antibiotics.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of pyoverdines as a novel class of antibacterials against human opportunistic pathogens. The low toxicity and limited resistance evolution of pyoverdines make them an attractive alternative to traditional antibiotics. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of pyoverdines as a sustainable solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Synaptic Mechanisms of Prefrontal Network Failure in Schizophrenia: A Recurrent Spiking Network Model

    **Research Question:** How do disruptions at the synaptic level contribute to the failure of prefrontal networks in schizophrenia, and what are the underlying circuit mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits to investigate the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyzed the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network to inform the biological data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony. This finding strongly parallels the dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists.

    **Implications:** Our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. These findings establish a theoretical basis and circuit mechanism explaining how reduction of NMDAR synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia could lead to the desynchronization of neural activity in prefrontal recurrent circuits.

    **Conclusions:** Our study addresses a crucial gap in our understanding of schizophrenia by elucidating the synaptic mechanisms underlying prefrontal network failure. By developing a recurrent spiking network model, we provide evidence that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations. Our findings have important implications for understanding the neural basis of schizophrenia and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting NMDAR synaptic function.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Dynamics of Angiogenic Morphogenesis: An Order-Disorder Transition in Tip-Stalk Cell Patterning

    **Research Question:** How do endothelial cells differentiate into Tip and Stalk phenotypes during angiogenesis, and what role does NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication play in this process?

    **Methods:** We combined a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses to investigate the dynamics of Tip-Stalk cell patterning. We used a Turing-like model to simulate the spatial patterning of Tip and Stalk cells in response to varying levels of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the regular spatial patterning of Tip and Stalk cells can undergo an order-disorder transition at a relatively high input level of VEGF. This transition is characterized by a robust but temporally unstable differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk phenotypes, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. We also found that sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that depends on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation that enables but does not instruct subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis. This implies that additional cues and self-organization mechanisms are required for effective vascular morphogenesis. Our analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the dynamics of angiogenic morphogenesis, highlighting the importance of NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication in regulating Tip-Stalk cell patterning. Our results support a dynamic view of angiogenic induction, where VEGF input can induce NOTCH signaling and formation of Tip cells that can behave as mini-sprouts. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of complex multicellular processes, including collective epithelial migration, and underscore the need for more refined models that integrate biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Role of Locus Coeruleus-Derived Dopamine in Hippocampal Memory Formation during Trace Fear Conditioning

    **Research Question:** What is the precise timing of locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus during learning and memory formation, and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are crucial for memory formation in the hippocampus?

    **Methods:** We employed optogenetic stimulation and pharmacological manipulations in mice to investigate the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) during trace fear conditioning. We also measured the release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the dHPC.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the LC and its projections to the dHPC respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation enhances long-term memory formation. We found that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dHPC, and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Notably, we demonstrate that hippocampal dopamine is essential for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long-term memory formation. The release of dopamine from the LC into the hippocampus appears to play a critical role in this process, whereas norepinephrine does not.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the temporal dynamics of LC-HPC communication during learning and memory formation. Our results highlight the importance of dopamine release from the LC in the hippocampus for trace fear memory formation, challenging the traditional view that norepinephrine is the primary neurotransmitter released by the LC. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for memory-related disorders.
