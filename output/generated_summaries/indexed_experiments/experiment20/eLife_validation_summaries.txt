    **Title:** GLP-1/Notch Signaling Facilitates Cell-Fate Reprogramming in C. elegans Germline through Antagonism with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2

    **Research Question:** How does the GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway contribute to cell-fate reprogramming in the C. elegans germline, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes to investigate the role of GLP-1/Notch signaling in cell-fate reprogramming in the C. elegans germline.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to its established role in maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors, we discovered that GLP-1/Notch signaling promotes cell-fate reprogramming by activating specific genes silenced by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). We identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. Notably, we found that GLP-1/Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions, with GLP-1/Notch activating genes repressed by PRC2.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling. The discovery of GLP-1/Notch's role in promoting cell-fate reprogramming highlights the complex interplay between signaling pathways and chromatin regulators in regulating cell fate decisions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel function of the GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway in facilitating cell-fate reprogramming in the C. elegans germline through antagonism with PRC2. The identification of UTX-1 as a critical GLP-1/Notch target provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. These findings contribute to our understanding of the intricate relationships between signaling pathways and chromatin regulators in regulating cell fate decisions, with potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

    **Title:** SKAP2-dependent Signaling in Neutrophils is Essential for Clearance of Klebsiella pneumoniae Infections

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the adaptor protein SKAP2 in host defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) pulmonary infections?

    **Methods:** We used a murine model of K. pneumoniae 43816 infection to investigate the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense. SKAP2-deficient (Skap2-/-) mice were compared to wild-type mice in terms of bacterial burden, neutrophil function, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Skap2-/- mice had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, indicating that SKAP2 is essential for protection against K. pneumoniae infections. SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils was found to be critical for K. pneumoniae-induced ROS production, which is a key mechanism for bacterial clearance. In contrast, neutrophil degranulation and phagocytosis were not affected by SKAP2 expression. Furthermore, we identified a signaling cascade involving Src family kinases (SFKs), Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PKC that is required for K. pneumoniae-induced ROS production, and SKAP2 was found to be proximal to their activation.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils for host defense against K. pneumoniae infections. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, indicating that SKAP2 plays a critical role in K. pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways. The sensitivity of K. pneumoniae to ROS is supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice and observations in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates that SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of host defense against K. pneumoniae infections and highlight the potential of SKAP2 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections.

    **Title:** Modeling the Hypnozoite Reservoir in Plasmodium vivax Malaria: Implications for Transmission and Control

    **Research Question:** How does the hypnozoite reservoir in the liver contribute to the transmission dynamics of Plasmodium vivax malaria, and what are the implications for malaria control interventions?

    **Methods:** We developed a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites, which was validated against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The model was then embedded in a P. vivax transmission model to simulate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the hypnozoite reservoir is over-dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, while others have intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P. vivax transmission. Incorporating hypnozoite-killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission, as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

    **Implications:** The hypnozoite reservoir is a critical component of P. vivax transmission dynamics, and its inclusion in malaria transmission models can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, blood, and liver. Our results suggest that targeting the hypnozoite reservoir through primaquine treatment can be an effective strategy for reducing P. vivax transmission.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of considering the hypnozoite reservoir in P. vivax malaria transmission models and highlights the potential benefits of incorporating hypnozoite-killing drugs into malaria control strategies. Our findings have important implications for the development of effective interventions to control and eliminate P. vivax malaria.

**Title:** Predicting Carbon Recovery in Amazonian Forests after Selective Logging: A Regional Analysis

**Research Question:** How do regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass influence carbon (C) recovery in Amazonian forests after selective logging?

**Methods:** We employed a novel modeling approach, calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots (175 ha total) across Amazonia, to link regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass with survivors' and recruits' C fluxes. We analyzed long-term (8-30 year) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west (21 ± 3 Mg C ha-1) than in the south (12 ± 3 Mg C ha-1), where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). We found that survivors play a crucial role in forest regrowth and that the main drivers of C recovery are the growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass when predicting C recovery in Amazonian forests after selective logging. We provide a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia, which can inform forest management and conservation efforts.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regional patterns of C recovery in Amazonian forests after selective logging. By understanding the key drivers of C recovery, we can develop more effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of human activities on C cycles in tropical forests. Our results have important implications for the management of Amazonian forests, which are a critical component of the global C cycle.

    **Title:** Distinguishing Neural Stem Cells from Neurosphere-Initiating Cells in the Adult Mouse Subventricular Zone

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ)?

    **Methods:** We prospectively identified and isolated NICs from the adult mouse SVZ using flow cytometry, and characterized them as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− (GEPCOT) cells. We also isolated pre-GEPCOT cells, which were quiescent and expressed higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2.

    **Main Findings:** GEPCOT cells were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo, whereas pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent and long-lived. GEPCOT cells were able to form neurospheres and undergo multilineage differentiation, whereas pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers such as Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted both GEPCOT and pre-GEPCOT cells, although pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent on Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a (p16Ink4a) repression.

    **Implications:** Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and provide a framework for studying their properties in vivo. The identification of GEPCOT cells as NICs highlights their role in neurogenesis, while the characterization of pre-GEPCOT cells as quiescent NSCs underscores their importance in maintaining the SVZ stem cell niche.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the relationship between NICs and NSCs in the adult mouse SVZ, and highlights the importance of distinguishing between these two cell populations. The identification of GEPCOT cells as NICs and pre-GEPCOT cells as quiescent NSCs has significant implications for our understanding of neurogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Piezo1 Channels Function as Independent Mechanotransducers at Physiologically Relevant Densities

    **Research Question:** Do Piezo1 ion channels interact functionally with each other at different densities, and if so, how does this impact their pressure sensitivity and open probability?

    **Methods:** We employed cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to investigate Piezo1 ion channels in cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions were also used to complement the electrophysiological data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability, even at non-physiological densities predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap. This suggests that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers.

    **Implications:** These findings are crucial for understanding how cells transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane. The ability of Piezo channels to function independently is essential for cells to detect and respond to mechanical forces in a spatially homogeneous manner.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that Piezo1 channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, do not exhibit strong intrinsic tendencies to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity. This property enables cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane. These results have significant implications for our understanding of mechanotransduction in cells and highlight the importance of Piezo channels in detecting and responding to mechanical forces in various physiological contexts.

    **Title:** Investigating the Effects of Volatility on Decision-Making: A Bounded Evidence Accumulation Model

    **Research Question:** How does an increase in noise, or volatility, affect decision speed, accuracy, and confidence in motion-selective regions of the visual cortex?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel sensory manipulation to mimic the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex in macaque areas MT/MST. This manipulation was verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. We used a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task to study the relationship between volatility and decision speed in both humans and monkeys.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model. Specifically, we found that an increase in noise led to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically, higher confidence in both humans and monkeys.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence for the bounded evidence accumulation model, which suggests that decisions arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. This model makes intriguing predictions about the noise itself, including that an increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and higher confidence. Our results support these predictions and have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision, or volatility, increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and provide a framework for understanding the joint effect of volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence. Our results support the bounded evidence accumulation model and highlight the importance of considering the role of noise in decision-making processes.

    **Title:** Regulation of Caenorhabditis elegans Lifespan by the Insulin-like Signaling Pathway and Calcineurin

    **Research Question:** How do the insulin-like signaling pathway and Calcineurin regulate lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of the insulin-like signaling pathway and Calcineurin in regulating lifespan in C. elegans using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown genes involved in the insulin-like signaling pathway and Calcineurin, and examined the effects on DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors in mammalian cells.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan in C. elegans by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16. Calcineurin (TAX-6•CNB-1) also limits lifespan, but the mechanism was unknown. We discovered that TAX-6•CNB-1 and UNC-43, the C. elegans Calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) orthologs, respectively, regulate lifespan through DAF-16. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that CAMKII (UNC-43) and Calcineurin (TAX-6•CNB-1) regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes raises the possibility that they would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control over DAF-16. However, our data suggest that insulin signaling dominates over CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling in regulating DAF-16 localization.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of lifespan in C. elegans and highlights the complex interplay between the insulin-like signaling pathway and Calcineurin in regulating DAF-16. These findings have implications for our understanding of aging and age-related diseases in mammals, where FOXO transcription factors, including FOXO3, are also regulated by CAMKII and Calcineurin.

    **Title:** Hierarchical Suppression of Motor Programs Underlies the Serial Organization of Grooming Behavior in Fruit Flies

    **Research Question:** How do nervous systems implement the serial execution of different movements to form motor sequences?

    **Methods:** We used genetically targeted activation of neural subsets in fruit flies to drive distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This enabled competition experiments to reveal the organizational principles governing the grooming sequence.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy.

    **Implications:** This study provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences. Our findings suggest that the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence.

    **Conclusions:** We propose a model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel, but selected serially through hierarchical suppression, which successfully reproduces the grooming sequence. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical suppression among many behaviors leads to the emergence of a sequence, and we anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism.

    **Significance:** This study contributes to our understanding of the neural control of serial action selection in an innate behavior common to most limbed animals—grooming. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of motor sequence generation and may shed light on the evolution of complex behaviors in animals.

    **Title:** Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) coordinates chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes by regulating cohesion resolution, kinetochore-microtubule interactions, and the spindle assembly checkpoint.

    **Research Question:** How do diverse processes, including cohesion resolution, kinetochore-microtubule interactions, and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), coordinate to ensure accurate chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the role of Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in regulating chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Sgol2 plays a crucial role in turning off the SAC, promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitating the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers), and limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin and silence the SAC depends on its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by the recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that Sgol2 is a key regulator of chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes, linking multiple processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation. The pleiotropic consequences of Sgol2 depletion, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and altered kinetochore-microtubule attachments, highlight the importance of Sgol2 in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that Sgol2 is a multifunctional protein that regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and Aurora B/C kinases. By demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes, we show that the pleiotropy observed in Sgol2-deficient oocytes is not due to secondary or tertiary pathology. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes and highlight the importance of Sgol2 as a key regulator of this complex process.

    **Title:** Experience-Dependent Changes in Brain Connectivity Require RNA Localization and Protein Synthesis: A Role for Netrin-1/DCC Signaling

    **Research Question:** Do local stimulation and synaptic activity regulate the trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites, and what is the role of netrin-1/DCC signaling in this process?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of imaging and biochemical techniques to investigate RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons. Imaging of RNA localization and translation revealed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. Investigation of the mechanisms that trigger local translation revealed a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues. We found that rRNA, three specific mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the sensory neuron, but translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation. Netrin-1/DCC signaling was identified as a key regulator of local translation at synapses and/or stimulated synapses.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. The release of netrin-1 from either the sensory neuron (SN) or motor neuron (MN) during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity triggers translation at sites of synaptic but not non-synaptic contacts.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that local stimulation and synaptic activity regulate the trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites, and that netrin-1/DCC signaling plays a critical role in this process. These findings have important implications for our understanding of experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity and synaptic plasticity, and highlight the importance of local translation in regulating gene expression in neurons.

    **Title:** Mosaic Knockdown of Molecular Regulators Reveals Cell-Driven Self-Organization in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Colonies

    **Research Question:** How do cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization emerge in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies, and can we genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns?

    **Methods:** We employed an inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in hiPSCs to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion (CDH1) and cortical tension (ROCK1). We created mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and induced mosaic knockdown (KD) to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation.

    **Main Findings:** Mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induction stimulated a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells. This approach enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that mechanical manipulation of hiPSC sub-populations can result in controllable cell-driven self-organization into repeatable patterns. By silencing target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells, we provide multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns. Ultimately, this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.

    **Title:** A Normative Theory for Set Size Effects in Visual Working Memory

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism driving the decrease in encoding precision in visual working memory as the number of encoded items increases?

    **Methods:** We propose a normative theory that posits the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model based on this theory and test its predictions using data from nine delayed-estimation experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Our model accounts well for the effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision, aligning with previous empirical findings. Notably, we find that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size, suggesting that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task.

    **Implications:** Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive "limitations" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints. This theory may also apply beyond working memory tasks, providing a normative formalism to explain set size effects in attention tasks. Furthermore, our model predicts a non-monotonic relation between population-level spiking activity and set size, which can be tested using neuroimaging experiments.

    **Conclusions:** Our normative theory provides a principled explanation for the decrease in encoding precision with increasing set size in visual working memory. The model's ability to account for both set size and probing probability effects, as well as the non-monotonic relation between set size and resource investment, supports its validity. These findings have implications for our understanding of cognitive limitations and the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and attention. Future studies can test the model's predictions and explore its applicability to other cognitive tasks.

    **Title:** A Plant Pathogen Effector Exploits Host Autophagy to Promote Disease Susceptibility

    **Research Question:** How do plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes to counteract host defenses?

    **Methods:** Using the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans as a model, we investigated the interaction between the pathogen effector PexRD54 and the host autophagy protein ATG8CL.

    **Main Findings:** We show that PexRD54 binds to ATG8CL with high affinity and stimulates the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes. Furthermore, PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes, thereby interfering with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses. This finding highlights the complex interplay between plant pathogens and host autophagy pathways.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that, in addition to disrupting autophagy, pathogens can also activate autophagy for their own benefit. Specifically, PexRD54 competes with the host cargo receptor Joka2 and depletes it out of ATG8CL autophagosomes to promote disease susceptibility. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-pathogen interactions and highlight the importance of autophagy in plant defense against pathogens.

    **Future Directions:** Future studies will need to consider the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection. Additionally, it will be interesting to determine whether other plant pathogens also secrete effectors that evolved an ATG8 interacting motif or target autophagy in other ways. These effectors would serve as valuable tools to dissect the mechanisms of defense-related selective autophagy.

    **Keywords:** autophagy, plant-pathogen interaction, PexRD54, ATG8CL, Joka2, Phytophthora infestans.

    **Title:** Elucidating Cardiac Fibroblast Responses to Simultaneous Environmental Stimuli: A Novel In Vitro Model of Cardiac Injury

    **Research Question:** How do cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) respond to a combination of mechanical strain and oxygen tension changes, mimicking early environmental changes in cardiac injury?

    **Methods:** We employed a multi-stimulus microdevice to apply cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to human primary CFs. We examined the effects of individual and combined stimuli on CF behavior, including proliferation, collagen production, and cytokine release.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that individual stimuli, such as mechanical strain or hypoxia, induce distinct CF responses, including proliferation, YAP translocation, and PDGF secretion. However, only the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility (2% strain) triggers the release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. This synergistic effect was not observed with individual stimuli.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between environmental stimuli and CF responses in cardiac injury. The combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility may play a crucial role in triggering pathological responses in CFs, leading to fibrotic remodeling. This understanding has significant implications for the development of in vitro models of cardiac disease and the design of reparative strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study presents a novel in vitro model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury. By finely controlling mechanical strain and oxygen regimes, we have elucidated the individual and synergistic contributions of environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease. This model provides a valuable tool for future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the development of therapeutic interventions. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between environmental stimuli and CF responses in the context of cardiac injury, and suggest that the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility may be a critical trigger for pathological responses in CFs.

    **Title:** Alternative Isoforms of the DOMINO Nucleosome Remodeling ATPase Specify Distinct Chromatin Regulators in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** How do the alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase (DOM-A and DOM-B) contribute to transcriptional regulation in Drosophila, and what are the mechanisms underlying their distinct functions?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the functions of DOM-A and DOM-B in Drosophila cells. We used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze the effects of knockdowns of DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60, and H2A.V on transcription. We also performed biochemical assays to examine the ATPase activity of DOM-A and its ability to acetylate histone H4.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that DOM-A and DOM-B form distinct multi-subunit complexes that are necessary for transcriptional regulation. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. In contrast, the DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. Our data also suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of chromatin regulation in Drosophila and highlight the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators. The distinct functions of DOM-A and DOM-B illustrate how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation, as seen in yeast and humans, where nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification.

    **Conclusions:** Our work demonstrates that the alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase specify distinct chromatin regulators in Drosophila, with DOM-A functioning as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex and DOM-B incorporating H2A.V into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner. These findings have implications for our understanding of chromatin regulation and highlight the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.

    **Title:** Muscle β-Catenin Regulates Presynaptic Differentiation via Transcriptional Regulation of Slit2

    **Research Question:** What functions of muscle β-Catenin (Ctnnb1) are critical for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, and how does it regulate presynaptic differentiation?

    **Methods:** We employed an in vivo transgenic approach to dissect the functions of muscle Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation. We generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type or Ctnnb1 mutants that were impaired in transcriptional regulation or cell-adhesion signaling.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the transcriptional activity of muscle Ctnnb1 is essential for presynaptic differentiation, as a Ctnnb1 mutant lacking the transactivation domain (TAD) was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits caused by Ctnnb1 mutation. In contrast, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. We identified Slit2 as a potential retrograde factor that mediates the effects of muscle Ctnnb1 on presynaptic differentiation. Transgenic expression of Slit2 in muscle cells was able to diminish presynaptic deficits caused by Ctnnb1 mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density, and depressed miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation via transcriptional regulation of Slit2, a protein that repels or collapses neuronal axons. This retrograde pathway is critical for NMJ formation and maintenance. The identification of Slit2 as a key mediator of muscle Ctnnb1's effects on presynaptic differentiation provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NMJ formation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the transcriptional activity of muscle Ctnnb1 is essential for presynaptic differentiation, and that Slit2 is a critical downstream effector of muscle Ctnnb1 in this process. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NMJ formation and maintenance, and may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions in neuromuscular disorders.

    **Title:** Force Transduction at Cell-Cell Adhesions Regulates Tissue Development, Maintenance, and Adaptation

    **Research Question:** How do mechanical forces transmitted through cell-cell adhesions regulate tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation in dynamic epithelial tissues?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel computational and experimental approach to quantify force transmission in cell clusters with sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution. We applied this technology to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters and analyzed the dynamics of force transmission at individual cell-cell junctions and the multi-cellular scale.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that basal force fluctuations are coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell-cell force exchange depends on the cell position within a cluster and is adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell requires coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors.

    **Implications:** These findings provide insights into the mechanisms that control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues. Our results highlight the importance of force transmission through cell-cell adhesions in regulating tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that force transduction at cell-cell adhesions plays a crucial role in regulating tissue mechanics. The development of our computational and experimental approach provides a valuable resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation, and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for tissue-related diseases.

    **Key Takeaways:**

    * Force transmission through cell-cell adhesions is essential for tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Structural and Biochemical Properties of Huntingtin and the Impact of Polyglutamine Expansion in Huntington’s Disease

    **Research Question:** How does the polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease, and what are the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin that are affected by this expansion?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry, to investigate the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid structure, with the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions forming a circumscribed central cavity. Notably, we found that the polyglutamine expansion increases the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects intramolecular interactions among the domains.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin and the impact of the polyglutamine expansion on its structure and function. Our results suggest that the polyglutamine expansion may confer a novel property on huntingtin, enabling quantitative or qualitative modulation of its function according to the size of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying Huntington’s disease. These findings have significant implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the polyglutamine expansion and its impact on huntingtin structure and function. Our results demonstrate that the polyglutamine expansion affects the α-helical properties of huntingtin and its intramolecular interactions, providing an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease.

    **Title:** NCOA4-mediated Ferritinophagy: Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Iron-Dependent Regulation

    **Research Question:** How does NCOA4, a selective cargo receptor, regulate the autophagic turnover of ferritin in response to changes in intracellular iron levels?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches to investigate the interaction between NCOA4 and ferritin (FTH1), as well as the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in regulating NCOA4 abundance. We used zebrafish and cultured cells to study the physiological relevance of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that NCOA4 directly interacts with FTH1 via a conserved C-terminal domain and a key arginine residue on FTH1. This interaction is essential for the delivery of ferritin to lysosomes via autophagosomes. We also show that NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Under high iron conditions, the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase promotes NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, reducing NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. Conversely, under low iron conditions, NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and explain how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4 activity. We show that NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation in zebrafish and cultured cells, highlighting the importance of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of ferritinophagy and the role of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes. The identification of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction and the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in regulating NCOA4 abundance sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ferritinophagy. These findings have important implications for our understanding of iron metabolism and the development of therapeutic strategies for iron-related disorders.

    Title: Hierarchical Organization of the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex: Unveiling the Apex of Higher-Level Cognition

    Research Question: How is the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) functionally organized to support higher-level cognition?

    Methods: We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling to investigate the hierarchical organization of the LPFC in humans. We examined the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC and modeled interactions among LPFC sub-regions to determine whether and how cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing.

    Main Findings: Our results revealed rostral/caudal gradients of abstraction in the LPFC, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract levels of cognitive control. Dynamic causal modeling revealed asymmetrical LPFC interactions indicative of hierarchical processing, with the mid LPFC positioned as the apex of the hierarchy. We found that cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards mid LPFC, consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. Furthermore, the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with the mid LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior. The relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned mid LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy, contrary to dominant assumptions. Our results also indicate that cognitive demands elicit top-down influences from rostral to mid LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid LPFC, suggesting that mid LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action.

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for a hierarchical organization of the LPFC, with the mid LPFC playing a critical role in integrating information for control operations. The strengths of these dynamics were related to higher-level cognitive ability, suggesting that the functional organization of the LPFC is intimately tied to cognitive capacity. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of higher-level cognition and may inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for cognitive disorders.
Title: Identification of TBC1D3 as a Hominoid-Specific Gene Regulating Cortical Expansion and Folding through Generation of Outer Radial Glia

    Abstract:
    The evolution of higher intelligence in hominoids is often linked to cortical expansion and folding. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 in regulating cortical development. We found that expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promoted the generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with the morphology of outer radial glia (oRGs), which are abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of oRGs. Notably, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Our findings suggest that TBC1D3 is a hominoid gene required for oRG generation and regulation of cortical expansion and folding.

    Methods:
    We used in utero electroporation to express TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5). We also examined the effect of TBC1D3 expression on the intrinsic stemness signaling pathways in basal progenitors (BPs) using flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15.

    Main Findings:
    We found that TBC1D3 expression in vRGs caused delamination and promoted the generation of self-renewing BPs with the morphology of oRGs. Down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of oRGs. Localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that TBC1D3 is a hominoid gene required for oRG generation and regulation of cortical expansion and folding. This study provides proof-of-concept that brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution.

    Conclusions:
    We have identified TBC1D3 as a hominoid-specific gene that regulates cortical expansion and folding through the generation of oRGs. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding and suggest that TBC1D3 is a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding.

    **Title:** Stepwise Ubiquitination of NPR1 Regulates Immune-Induced Transcriptome Reprogramming in Plants

    **Research Question:** Does ubiquitination of the immune coactivator NPR1 play a transcriptional role prior to its proteasomal degradation, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of ubiquitination in NPR1-mediated immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and molecular biology approaches.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a stepwise process, initiated by the Cullin-RING E3 ligase CRL3, which promotes chromatin association and expression of target genes. The subsequent extension of ubiquitin chains by the E4 ligase UBE4 leads to proteasomal degradation of NPR1. However, we also identified two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases, UBP6/7, which counteract UBE4 activity and enhance NPR1 longevity.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that the sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases, balanced by opposing deubiquitinases, fine-tune the activity of NPR1 without requiring its sacrificial turnover. This suggests that ubiquitination can act as a transcriptional signal, allowing NPR1 to activate its target genes prior to degradation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming in plants. We propose that the initial ubiquitination of NPR1 by CRL3 enhances its transcriptional coactivator activity, while the subsequent extension of ubiquitin chains by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation. The opposing activities of UBP6/7 deubiquitinases further fine-tune NPR1 activity, allowing for a dynamic regulation of immune responses. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between ubiquitination, proteasomal degradation, and transcriptional regulation in plants.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Biogenesis of 24 Nucleotide Small Interfering RNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 nt siRNAs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, and what are the roles of nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), and DICER-like 3 (DCL3) in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches to investigate the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We analyzed the accumulation of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) in dcl3 mutants and demonstrated that these RNAs are diced into 24 nt siRNAs by DCL3 in vitro.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt in length and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. We also found that the 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and highlight the essential roles of Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 in this process. Our results also suggest that P4R2 RNAs are the immediate precursors of siRNAs, which are diced into 24 nt siRNAs by DCL3.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and provides new insights into the roles of Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 in this process. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome stability in plants.

**Title:** Emergence of Mature Cortical Network Dynamics: A Discrete Transition Period in Early Postnatal Development

**Research Question:** How do immature neural networks develop into their mature form, enabling complex computations underlying cognition, during early postnatal development?

**Methods:** We employed high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice to investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development.

**Main Findings:** Our study reveals that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, followed by the emergence of spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that facilitates a transition in network operation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that a transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. This period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations. We propose that the emergence of mature cortical network dynamics is preceded by a discrete, relatively quiescent, evolutionarily conserved transition period during early postnatal development. This period is characterized by a nadir in oscillations and neural spiking, signaling the shift from local, loosely correlated, putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. Our findings have implications for understanding the development of cognitive functions and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Modeling the Coexistence of Multiple Strains in Plasmodium falciparum Populations: The Role of Immune Selection in Structuring Parasite Diversity

    **Research Question:** How does immune selection influence the coexistence of multiple strains in Plasmodium falciparum populations that undergo sexual recombination, and what are the implications for malaria control?

    **Methods:** We developed an agent-based model that extends earlier ‘strain theory’ to address the var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum, which encodes the major surface antigen PfEMP1. The model tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts, considering the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression.

    **Main Findings:** Our model shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes. The degree of antigenic overlap between these repertoires depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune selection in structuring parasite diversity.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that immune selection plays a crucial role in shaping the diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations, even in the presence of high levels of sexual recombination. This has significant implications for malaria control, as it implies that vector control strategies that reduce transmission may not always drastically reduce var gene diversity. A reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse, highly non-overlapping var repertoires will remain, potentially limiting the effectiveness of control measures.

    **Conclusions:** Our agent-based model provides new insights into the coexistence of multiple strains in Plasmodium falciparum populations and highlights the importance of immune selection in structuring parasite diversity. These findings have important implications for the development of effective malaria control strategies, emphasizing the need to consider the complex interactions between parasite populations and the host immune system.

    **Title:** Deamidation of UBC13 by Shigella flexneri Effector OspI Disrupts Polyubiquitination Activity and Silences NF-κB Inflammatory Response

    **Research Question:** How does the deamidase OspI from Shigella flexneri inhibit the polyubiquitination activity of the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, leading to silencing of the NF-κB inflammatory response?

    **Methods:** We employed biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the effects of OspI-mediated deamidation of UBC13 on its interaction with TRAF6 RING-domain (TRAF6RING) and subsequent polyubiquitination activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that OspI deamidates a glutamine residue (Q100) in UBC13, converting it to glutamate (E100), which disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING. Specifically, deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface, preventing transient interactions necessary for complex formation. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of TRAF6RING further inhibits transient interactions.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight a novel mechanism by which a post-translational modification (deamidation) can perturb the conformation and stability of transient protein complexes, leading to inhibition of protein-protein association. This mechanism may have broader implications for understanding how pathogens manipulate host cell signaling pathways to evade immune responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that OspI-mediated deamidation of UBC13 is a key mechanism by which Shigella flexneri suppresses the NF-κB inflammatory response. By disrupting the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, OspI prevents the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are essential for NF-κB activation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of Shigella flexneri pathogenesis and highlight the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating protein-protein interactions.

**Title:** Bidirectional Manipulation of Cortical Interneurons Reveals Asymmetry in Computational Functions

**Research Question:** Do bidirectional manipulations (activation and inactivation) of specific cortical interneuron types provide internally consistent insights into their computational roles?

**Methods:** We used single-unit recordings in the auditory cortex of awake mice to investigate the effects of optogenetic manipulation of somatostatin-positive (Sst+) and parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons on tone-responses.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that inactivation of Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivation of Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. In contrast, activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry and found that small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons' computational functions.

**Implications:** Our findings challenge the assumption that bidirectional manipulations provide a straightforward way to identify the functions supported by specific cortical interneuron types. Instead, our results suggest that the effects of activation and inactivation can be context-dependent and influenced by various factors, such as the type of interneuron and the experimental conditions.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the complexities of interneuron function and the need for a more nuanced approach to understanding their computational roles. By using a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying interneuron function and develop more effective strategies for manipulating and interpreting the results of bidirectional manipulations. Our findings have implications for the broader goal of establishing the ways in which we can use causal strategies to gain insight into interneuron function.

    Title: Phase-Specific Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Enhances Working Memory Performance by Modulating Large-Scale Brain Synchronization

    Background: Working memory (WM) is an emergent property of large-scale network interactions, and oscillatory activity is thought to contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, the causal evidence for how oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited.

    Research Question: Can transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) be used to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM, and if so, does it improve performance in a demanding WM task?

    Methods: Two experiments were conducted using tACS to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms in a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands. Participants performed a verbal WM task while undergoing fMRI and tACS.

    Main Findings: Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data revealed tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network.

    Implications: Our findings demonstrate a direct link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization across a right frontoparietal network activated by the task. We show that manipulations of tACS phase modulate the underlying brain activity and that tACS can influence long-range connectivity in a phase- and brain state-dependent manner.

    Conclusions: Our results provide causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding WM performance and reveal the neural correlates associated with this process. We demonstrate that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and those modulations are detectable using fMRI. These findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for WM-related disorders.

    **Title:** Identification of Pitx2 as a Key Regulator of Embryonic Polarity in Amniotes

    **Research Question:** How is embryonic polarity determined in amniote embryos, which remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation, in contrast to invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates, where polarity is specified by maternal determinants?

    **Methods:** A molecular screen was conducted to identify upstream regulators of cVg1, a transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation in chick embryos. Bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments were used to identify the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate regulator of cVg1 expression.

    **Main Findings:** We show that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation and acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1, and Nodal are also key actors in left-right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.

    **Implications:** Our findings implicate Pitx2 as the earliest gene described to date that regulates the position of the embryonic axis, as well as embryonic regulation/regeneration and twinning. This suggests that Pitx2 plays a crucial role in the earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity in amniotes.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of embryonic polarity determination in amniotes, which differ from those in invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates. The identification of Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression highlights its importance in axis formation and left-right asymmetry. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of embryonic development and the conservation of developmental mechanisms across species. Further studies on Pitx2 and its downstream targets will be essential to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying embryonic polarity determination in amniotes.

    **Title:** Temporal Processing of Olfactory Stimuli in Drosophila Melanogaster Reveals Acceleration Encoding in Early Olfactory Circuits

    **Research Question:** How do early olfactory circuits in Drosophila melanogaster process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, and what is the role of projection neurons (PNs) in encoding dynamic odor information?

    **Methods:** We subjected Drosophila flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and PNs. We constructed a simple two-dimensional model to predict PN output based on OSN spike rate and its rate of change.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, with PNs strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. The two-dimensional model closely predicted PN output, indicating that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Drosophila's early olfactory system encodes dynamic odor information by signaling the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism enables animals to rapidly detect the onset of slowly rising odor stimuli, which is crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before their position drifts relative to adjacent plumes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that PNs play a critical role in processing temporal variation of olfactory stimuli in Drosophila melanogaster. By encoding acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli, PNs enable higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli. Our results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory processing in insects and have implications for understanding the neural basis of spatial orientation and navigation in animals.

    Title: Auxin-Dependent Regulation of Seed Coat Development in Flowering Plants

    Research Question: What is the role of auxin and the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 in regulating seed coat development in flowering plants?

    Methods: This study employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of auxin and AGL62 in seed coat development. The authors used Arabidopsis thaliana mutants and transgenic lines to analyze the effects of impaired auxin biosynthesis and signaling, as well as the ectopic expression of auxin in the central cell.

    Main Findings: The results show that fertilization of the central cell leads to the production of auxin, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing the Polycomb Group (PcG) block. Furthermore, mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 exhibit impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, resulting in seed abortion. The authors propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.

    Implications: The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seed coat development in flowering plants. The results suggest that auxin plays a dual role in driving both endosperm and seed coat development, and that AGL62 is a key regulator of auxin transport and seed coat development.

    Conclusions: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that auxin production in the fertilized central cell/endosperm is essential for seed coat development, and that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of seed development and the regulation of auxin-dependent processes in plants. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying seed coat development and the role of AGL62 in this process.

    **Title:** Systematic Dissection of the Tip Domain of T7 Phage Receptor Binding Protein Reveals Molecular Rules of Phage-Host Interactions

    **Research Question:** What is the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage Receptor Binding Protein (RBP) in governing phage activity and host range?

    **Methods:** We developed a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage genome engineering method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression) to create a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus. Using ORACLE, we systematically and comprehensively mutated the tip domain by making all single amino acid substitutions at every site (1660 variants) and quantified the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts.

    **Main Findings:** We generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. We discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. Furthermore, we engineered highly active T7 variants against a urinary tract pathogen, demonstrating the therapeutic utility of our approach.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range. The results indicate that ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wildtype phage that could become starting points for further engineering therapeutic phages. This approach presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our systematic dissection of the tip domain of T7 phage RBP provides new insights into the molecular rules of phage-host interactions. The high-throughput, locus-specific phage genome engineering method, ORACLE, enables the creation of large, unbiased libraries of phage variants, allowing for the identification of key functional regions and host-specific substitutional patterns. These findings have significant implications for the development of therapeutic phages against bacterial pathogens, including those causing urinary tract infections. Further experiments will be required to assess the in vivo efficacy of the engineered T7 variants.

**Title:** Neural Basis of Compensatory Mechanisms in Congenital Amusia: A Functional Connectivity Study

**Research Question:** How do individuals with congenital amusia compensate for their unreliable pitch processing during speech perception, and what is the neural basis of this compensatory mechanism?

**Methods:** We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of pitch processing in individuals with congenital amusia (N = 15) and controls (N = 15). Participants read sentences with a comma indicating a grammatical phrase boundary and then heard two spoken sentences that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues. They selected the best match for the written sentence.

**Main Findings:** We detected prominent reductions in functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions in the amusia group, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that individuals with congenital amusia have learned to down-weight pitch cues during speech perception due to the unreliability of their pitch processing. This compensatory mechanism is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas that integrate information from perceptual regions.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for a neural basis of compensatory mechanisms in congenital amusia. The reduced functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions in individuals with amusia suggests that they rely more heavily on other dimensions, such as duration, to process spoken language. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of speech perception and the development of compensatory strategies in individuals with congenital amusia. Future studies should investigate the neural basis of speech encoding in pitch-related language tasks within regions of interest selected with a whole-brain data-driven approach.

    **Title:** Emergence of Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2): A Contagious Cancer Exploiting Partial Histocompatibility between Tumour and Host

    **Background:** The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is plagued by two contagious cancers: Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2). While DFT1 has lost major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, allowing it to evade the host's immune response, the mechanisms underlying DFT2's contagious nature remain unclear.

    **Research Question:** Do DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, and if so, how do these molecules impact the tumour's ability to evade the host's immune response?

    **Methods:** We examined the expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 cells in vitro and in vivo using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to DFT1, DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. Furthermore, MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo, suggesting that MHC class I-negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that DFT2 cells exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host by expressing MHC class I molecules that are common among host devils. This may facilitate the tumour's ability to evade the host's immune response and transmit more widely. The emergence of MHC class I-negative subclones in vivo suggests that DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the contagious nature of DFT2. We propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, and that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2. Further research is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution.

    **Title:** Parallel Processing in the Granular Retrosplenial Cortex: Unveiling the Neural Codes for Spatial and Non-Spatial Behaviors

    **Background:** The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a critical role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, yet the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of precise sublaminar organization and distinct principal neuronal subtypes in the RSG.

    **Research Question:** How do parallel circuits in the superficial RSG process disparate inputs to support spatial orientation computations?

    **Methods:** We employed optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to investigate the neural codes underlying spatial and non-spatial behaviors in the RSG.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal a double dissociation between two types of principal pyramidal neurons in layer 3 of the RSG: low-rheobase (LR) neurons and regular-spiking (RS) cells. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit LR neurons, while claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information, preferentially control RS cells. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1 enables this parallel processing.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum. The observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights a superficial retrosplenial circuit enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents. The parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype, LR neurons, ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG. Future studies should investigate how these two parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices to gain a mechanistic understanding of retrosplenial computations.

    **Title:** Seizure Activity Promotes Prion-like Spreading of Tauopathy after Traumatic Brain Injury

    **Background:** Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for dementias, including tauopathies such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying the prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of tractable animal models.

    **Research Question:** Do seizures play a role in promoting the spread of tauopathy after TBI?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel zebrafish model expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Zebrafish larvae were subjected to a novel TBI paradigm, which produced various TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions.

    **Main Findings:** Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death, suggesting a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Our data reveal a substantial burst of neural activity occurs during TBI, and zebrafish larvae exposed to TBI exhibit a significantly higher propensity for spontaneous seizures.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that post-traumatic seizures are a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy. Manipulating seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation, revealing a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel in vivo TBI model implicates seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, offering potential therapeutic targets. These findings highlight the utility of zebrafish as a tractable model for studying TBI and tauopathy, and suggest that anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures may be a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy. Further work is warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of these findings.

    Title: Disentangling Spatial Topography and Functional Connectivity in Resting-State fMRI Data

    Research Question: To what extent do the spatial arrangement of cortical regions interact with measures of brain connectivity, and how do these interactions relate to non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle?

    Methods: This study employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) to investigate the relationship between the spatial configuration of functional brain regions and measures of brain connectivity. We used partial canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to examine the influence of spatial topography on derived measures of functional connectivity.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modeling of brain connectivity. We found that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle, suggesting that cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions may be misinterpreted as changes in functional connectivity.

    Implications: Our findings have significant implications for the interpretation of functional imaging data and cognitive traits. We propose that the spatial arrangement of functional brain regions may be a confounding factor in studies that aim to investigate the relationship between functional connectivity and behavior. Therefore, it is essential to disambiguate the influence of spatial topography to enable the estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of considering the spatial configuration of functional brain regions when interpreting functional imaging data. Our results suggest that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is a critical factor in determining the relationship between brain connectivity and behavior. By accounting for this spatial variability, researchers can gain a more accurate understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive traits and behavior. Ultimately, this study contributes to the development of more accurate and reliable methods for estimating functional connectivity and its relationship to behavior and lifestyle.

    **Title:** Revisiting the Role of TBP2 in Skeletal Muscle Gene Expression and Regeneration

    **Research Question:** Does TBP2 replace TBP in the transcription pre-initiation complex to control cell type-specific gene expression in skeletal muscle cells?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of TBP2 in skeletal muscle gene expression and regeneration using TBP2 null mice, C2C12 myoblasts, and primary mouse muscle stem cells (MuSCs). We analyzed the expression of TBP2 and TBP in myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts and primary mouse MuSCs, and examined the regeneration potential of TBP2 null mice after injury.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts or primary mouse MuSCs, and that TBP2-deficient mice have an intact regeneration potential after injury. Furthermore, we found that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. We also detected reduced amounts of TFIID subunits and TBP in myoblast differentiation, which form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the previous proposal that TBP2 replaces TBP in the PIC to control cell type-specific gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Instead, our results suggest that limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP are required to promote muscle-specific gene expression.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. Our findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression and regeneration, and highlight the need for further investigation into the role of TFIID-TBP in muscle cell differentiation.

    **Title:** Stimulation-Induced Neuroplasticity in Large-Scale Cortical Networks

    **Research Question:** How does brain stimulation modulate the excitability of neural circuits and drive neuroplasticity in large-scale networks?

    **Methods:** We employed a large-scale optogenetic interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocorticographic activity across primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex in two macaques. We tracked two measures of network connectivity: the network response to focal stimulation and baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes.

    **Main Findings:** Within minutes of stimulation in S1 or M1, we observed significant strengthening of gross functional connectivity between these areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network, reflecting correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity consistent with Hebbian plasticity models.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network, supporting a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that brain stimulation can modulate the excitability of neural circuits and drive neuroplasticity in large-scale networks. The observed changes in network connectivity are consistent with Hebbian plasticity models, suggesting that stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner. These findings have important implications for the development of novel neurorehabilitation strategies that leverage stimulation-based approaches to promote functional reorganization in the brain. Future studies should investigate intermediate time-frames and detailed cortical mapping to further elucidate the relationship between stimulation-induced plasticity and Hebbian learning.

    **Title:** Neural Consequences of Primary Visual Cortex Lesion in a Rhesus Macaque: Implications for Residual Visual Function

    **Research Question:** What are the neural consequences of a primary visual cortex (V1) lesion in a Rhesus macaque, and how do these consequences impact residual visual function?

    **Methods:** A rare case study of a Rhesus macaque (monkey S) born without V1 was conducted using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional connectivity analysis. Visual stimulation under anesthesia with checkerboards and full-field moving dots was used to activate visual structures outside of the lesion.

    **Main Findings:** Despite the absence of V1, monkey S's in-group behavior was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. Visual cortical activation was sparse, but included face patches. Functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Subcortical responses to visual stimulation were robust, but there was little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that residual visual function in the absence of V1 may be supported by an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests that either or both could support residual visual abilities. However, the lack of consistent visual cortex activation, possibly due to anesthesia, makes this question difficult to answer.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the neural consequences of a V1 lesion in a Rhesus macaque. The findings suggest that residual visual function may be supported by an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas, rather than strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT. These results have implications for the development of rehabilitation methods for human patients with V1 lesions. Further research is needed to fully understand the neural mechanisms underlying residual visual function in the absence of V1.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanism of IFI16-Mediated Recognition of Foreign dsDNA in the Host Nucleus

    **Research Question:** How does the innate immune sensor IFI16 distinguish between foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA of pathogenic origin and host genomic material inside the nucleus?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, including time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying IFI16-mediated recognition of foreign dsDNA.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. Notably, we show that nucleosomes act as barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism enables IFI16 to distinguish between friend and foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of IFI16-mediated recognition of foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus. We propose that the 1D-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, our results suggest that chromatinization acts as a key feature that allows IFI16 to distinguish host from foreign DNA in the nucleus.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves the central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways. The 1D scanning mechanism of IFI16 allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular basis of innate immunity and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases.
Title: Spatially Targeted Optical Microproteomics (STOMP): A Novel Technique for Interrogating Micron-Scale Regions of Interest in Mammalian Tissue

    Abstract:

    Research Question: Can a novel proteomics technique, Spatially Targeted Optical Microproteomics (STOMP), be developed to interrogate micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without genetic manipulation?

    Methods: STOMP combines two-photon laser scanning microscopy with photochemical affinity labeling and mass spectrometry. Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging along with two-photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI, to a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.

    Main Findings: As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. Gel electrophoresis of the indiscriminately photo-tagged proteins reveals a very different pattern of protein bands compared to the specimen in which amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for STOMP analysis. The predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample is Aβ, which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment due to its low overall abundance.

    Implications: STOMP has the potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification. This technique can be applied to various biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue.

    Conclusions: STOMP represents the first application of two-photon microscopy to affinity photolabeling, offering single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution that is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art LCM. This novel technique has great potential to provide clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease and advance research in cell biology.

    **Title:** Disruption of Frizzled3 (Fz3) Gene Impacts Axonal Growth and Survival in Cranial and Spinal Motor Neurons

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Frizzled3 (Fz3) in axonal growth and survival of cranial and spinal motor neurons during embryonic development?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of Fz3 gene disruption on axonal growth and survival in cranial and spinal motor neurons in Fz3−/− mice. We analyzed the morphology of motor axons in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, phrenic nerve, and dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Fz3−/− mice exhibit defects in axonal growth, with dorsal axons stalling at a precise location in the nerve plexus. In contrast to other axon path-finding mutants, Fz3−/− dorsal axons do not reroute to alternative trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death, suggesting that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule.

    **Implications:** Our findings implicate planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in motor axon growth and highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell-cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth. We also provide in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons require survival signals from intermediate targets to survive.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that Fz3 plays a crucial role in axonal growth and survival of cranial and spinal motor neurons during embryonic development. The absence of Fz3 leads to stalling of motor axons and subsequent cell death, suggesting that Fz3 is essential for the proper growth and guidance of motor axons. These findings have important implications for our understanding of PCP signaling and its role in axonal growth and development. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which Fz3 regulates axonal growth and survival in motor neurons.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Regulatory Roles of Transposable Elements in Early Mouse Development

    **Research Question:** Do transposable elements (TEs) play significant roles in establishing gene regulatory networks in early mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genetic editing approaches to investigate the regulatory functions of TEs in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Specifically, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR-mediated genetic excision to test the roles of long terminal repeat (LTR) TE families, including RLTR13D6 elements, in gene regulation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that a subset of TEs, particularly those belonging to the RLTR13D6 family, contribute to the establishment of tissue-specific gene expression programs in ESCs and TSCs. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data revealed that a large number of TEs are involved in regulating gene expression, and genetic editing experiments confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey using CRISPRi of RLTR13D6 elements in ESCs revealed that only a minority of these elements play significant roles in gene regulation.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of functional experiments in evaluating the gene regulatory roles of TEs, as some TEs may play only minor, redundant, or no role in gene regulation despite strong correlative evidence at the level of chromatin composition and conformation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a subset of TEs are essential for gene regulation in early mouse development, underscoring the complex and multifaceted nature of TE-mediated gene regulation. The results also emphasize the need for extensive genetic work to evaluate the proportion of TE+ enhancers that act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and development of gene regulatory networks in mammals.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Evolutionary Paths of C4 Photosynthesis: A Meta-Analysis and Bayesian Approach

    **Research Question:** How did C4 photosynthesis independently evolve in at least 60 plant lineages, and what are the underlying evolutionary drivers of this complex trait?

    **Methods:** We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3–C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterize a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. We developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. We found that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers, and that alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral lineage and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis.

    **Implications:** Our study provides insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages, C4 photosynthesis. We propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space. Our findings suggest that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis, which may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of a novel Bayesian approach to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. Our results have significant implications for understanding the evolution of complex traits and may benefit efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through genetic engineering of C3 species.

    **Title:** Revisiting the Evolution of Nucleotide Specificity in the Bacterial Cytoskeletal Protein SpoIVA

    **Research Question:** What drove the evolution of SpoIVA, a bacterial cytoskeletal protein, from a GTPase to an ATPase, and what is the role of nucleotide specificity in its function?

    **Methods:** We reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity, creating SpoIVAGTPase, and examined its function in vitro and in vivo. We also investigated the effects of varying ATP and GTP concentrations on SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase polymerization.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SpoIVAGTPase, although functional in vivo, failed to polymerize due to its inability to form an NDP-bound intermediate required for polymerization. Furthermore, incubation with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization, suggesting that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, is critical for specific biological functions. We also found that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation were the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that the nucleotide base, not just the energy released from hydrolysis, plays a crucial role in specific biological functions. This finding has implications for our understanding of the evolution of nucleotide specificity in proteins and highlights the importance of considering the chemical properties of nucleotides in protein function.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the evolution of SpoIVA from a GTPase to an ATPase was driven by the selective pressure of increased ATP levels at the end of sporulation. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of nucleotide specificity in proteins and underscores the importance of considering the chemical properties of nucleotides in protein function. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of protein function and the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting protein-nucleotide interactions.

    **Title:** Long-term Consequences of Early-Life Leptin Signaling Deficiency on Metabolic and Neuroendocrine Development

    **Research Question:** What are the long-term effects of early-life leptin signaling deficiency on metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental processes in mice?

    **Methods:** We investigated the consequences of leptin signaling deficiency in early life by restoring leptin signaling in mice null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene at either the fourth or tenth week of age.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that early-life leptin signaling deficiency led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Reactivation of LepR in adulthood also resulted in persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt, and Prlh mRNA expression, as well as defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Notably, defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. The results indicate that changes in leptin signaling during development can affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of leptin signaling during early life for long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life. These results have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases, particularly in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide.

    **Title:** Heterotrimeric G Proteins Regulate Immune Signaling in Arabidopsis through Dynamic Interactions with the FLS2-BIK1 Receptor Complex

    **Research Question:** How do heterotrimeric G proteins regulate immune signaling in Arabidopsis in response to bacterial flagellin epitope flg22?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in FLS2-mediated immune responses in Arabidopsis. We generated mutants of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2, and analyzed their effects on FLS2-mediated immune responses.

    **Main Findings:** We found that XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 in the pre-activation state, and functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following flg22 activation, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus, enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that heterotrimeric G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms. The G proteins play a crucial role in maintaining the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state, and their regulation of BIK1 stability contributes to the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in flg22-induced immune responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant immune signaling and highlight the importance of heterotrimeric G proteins in regulating immune responses in Arabidopsis. The dynamic interactions between XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2 with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex reveal a complex regulatory network that ensures optimal immune activation in response to bacterial flagellin epitope flg22.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Spatial Structure of the Arabidopsis Circadian Clock: Single-Cell Oscillations and Cell-to-Cell Coupling

    **Research Question:** How robust is the Arabidopsis circadian clock at the single-cell level, and how is clock timing coordinated across the plant?

    **Methods:** We used a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) to examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single-cell level over several days under constant environmental conditions.

    **Main Findings:** Our data reveal robust single-cell oscillations, albeit desynchronized, with two waves of clock activity observed: one going down and one up the root. We also find evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, especially in the root tip. A simple model suggests that cell-to-cell coupling and measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points. We estimate the coupling strength between cells and find evidence of coupling, especially strong in the root tip. Our findings support a more decentralized model of clock coordination in plants.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the Arabidopsis circadian clock is robust at the single-cell level and that cell-to-cell coupling plays a crucial role in coordinating clock timing across the plant. The observed waves of clock gene expression and variable clock periods at each position in the root contribute to desynchronization of oscillating single cells, leading to damping of rhythms at the whole plant level. Our results provide new insights into the spatial structure and coordination of the plant circadian clock system, challenging previous hierarchical models and supporting a more decentralized model of clock coordination in plants.

    **Title:** Neural Biomarkers for Multi-Talker Speech Intelligibility in Adults with Clinically Normal Hearing

    **Research Question:** Can we identify objective physiological markers that predict individual differences in multi-talker speech intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of psychophysical and neurophysiological tests, including ear canal EEG recordings, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral frequency modulation (FM) thresholds, to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying multi-talker speech intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing.

    **Main Findings:** We found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely among individuals with clinically normal hearing, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to FM cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. Specifically, combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. Furthermore, we identified a significant correlation between pupil recruitment functions and speech intelligibility threshold, suggesting that individuals with steeper pupil recruitment functions had more difficulty in the multi-talker speech task.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of hearing difficulties in adults with clinically normal hearing. The disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception identified here could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders. Our results suggest that objective physiological markers, such as neural phase-locking to FM cues and pupil-indexed listening effort, may be used to identify individuals with clinically normal hearing who struggle to follow conversations in noisy social environments.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a novel approach to understanding the neural mechanisms underlying multi-talker speech intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing. By combining psychophysical and neurophysiological tests, we have identified a set of neural biomarkers that can account for nearly 80% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. These findings have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of hearing difficulties in adults with clinically normal hearing, and may lead to the development of more effective interventions for individuals who struggle to communicate in noisy social environments.

    **Title:** Noninvasive Measurement of Single-Cell Blood Flow in the Mammalian Retina using 15 kHz Adaptive Optics Imaging

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a noninvasive imaging technique to measure single-cell blood flow in the full range of vessel sizes in the mammalian retina, without the need for surgery or contrast dye?

    **Methods:** We employed 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the C57BL/6J mouse retina. We used ultrafast camera capture to image blood cells without foreign contrast agents, and paired this with an automated analysis workflow to measure the velocity of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that we can measure single-cell velocity and flow rate in the smallest to largest vessels in the living mouse retina, with a range of 0.0002-1.55 µL min-1 across vessel diameters of 3.2-45.8 µm. We achieved high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second, without the need for exogenous contrast agents.

    **Implications:** This noninvasive imaging technique has significant implications for the study of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries, and may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the central nervous system. The eye may also serve as a window to systemic microvascular health.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of noninvasive measurement of single-cell blood flow in the mammalian retina using 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging. This technique has the potential to revolutionize the study of microvascular diseases and may be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation. Our method of noninvasively studying the retina may provide new insights into the dynamics of microcirculation in the CNS, and may ultimately lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of microvascular diseases.

    Title: Unraveling the Mechanisms of Symbiotic Signaling: SYMRK Plays a Central Role in Discriminating between Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis

    Research Question: What is the role of Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) in discriminating between arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis, and how do Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1) and NFR5 contribute to this process?

    Methods: We employed ectopic expression of NFR1, NFR5, and SYMRK in Lotus japonicus roots, as well as co-immuno-enrichment experiments to investigate the association between SYMRK and NFR1/NFR5.

    Main Findings: Our results show that ectopic expression of NFR1, NFR5, or SYMRK leads to spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in roots of L. japonicus. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signaling independently of either NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. Notably, only SYMRK overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis development.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that SYMRK plays a central role in discriminating between AM and root nodule symbiosis, and that NFR1 and NFR5 contribute to this process by associating with SYMRK. The simultaneous complex formation of SYMRK with NFR1 and NFR5 may explain the loss of signaling specificity, leading to the release of both negative regulatory mechanisms or an unbalanced stoichiometry of SYMRK and putative specific negative regulators of AM- and root nodule symbiosis signaling.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of symbiotic signaling and highlights the importance of SYMRK in discriminating between AM and root nodule symbiosis. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms, and may contribute to the development of novel strategies for improving plant-microbe interactions in agriculture.

Our approach improves processing speed by >2x compared to current methods without compromising accuracy.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate the versatility of DeepPoseKit in multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. Our results show that Stacked DenseNet offers considerable improvements over state-of-the-art models, achieving fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability.

    **Implications:** DeepPoseKit reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior, enabling researchers to collect larger, higher-resolution, and more reliable behavioral datasets. This, in turn, has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment.

    **Conclusions:** We present DeepPoseKit as a user-friendly and efficient software toolkit for estimating animal posture from images and videos. Our approach addresses the limitations of current methods in speed and robustness, making it a valuable resource for researchers across the behavioral sciences. The code, documentation, and examples for DeepPoseKit are freely available under a permissive open-source license, facilitating widespread adoption and further development. By providing a fast and accurate method for animal pose estimation, DeepPoseKit has the potential to transform our understanding of animal behavior and its underlying mechanisms.

    **Title:** Disruption of Glycolytic Flux Triggers NLRP3-Mediated Inflammatory Signaling and Pyroptosis in Innate Immune Cells

    **Research Question:** How do innate immune cells, such as macrophages, sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens and initiate pro-inflammatory responses?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of glycolytic flux in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) challenged with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium).

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that disruption of glycolytic flux, resulting from a drop in NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, triggers NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis in BMDMs. This signal can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. Furthermore, we found that S. typhimurium infection impairs NADH production, leading to mitochondrial ROS production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens. We propose that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, activating NLRP3 to initiate inflammatory responses.

    **Conclusions:** Disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, mediated by mitochondrial redox changes. Our findings suggest that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and S. typhimurium effectively limited glycolysis, resulting in NLRP3-mediated inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. Supplementation of the glycolytic product pyruvate resulted in significant reductions in caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and cell death induced by S. typhimurium.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Critical Role of PALB2 DNA Binding in Homology-Directed Repair and Chromosome Maintenance

    **Research Question:** What is the functional significance of PALB2 DNA binding in homology-directed repair (HDR) and chromosome maintenance?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and cell-based assays to investigate the DNA-binding properties of PALB2 and its role in HDR. We identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2 and generated mutations that reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency by 50%. We also characterized the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (N-DBD) of PALB2 and its ability to stimulate RAD51 strand exchange reactions.

    **Main Findings:** Our data reveal that PALB2 possesses a versatile DNA interaction property, which is essential for its function in HDR. We identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2 and demonstrated that mutations in this region significantly reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency. Furthermore, we found that the N-DBD of PALB2 stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro and can use RNA as a substrate. Notably, PALB2 N-DBD supports both forward and inverse strand exchange even in the absence of RAD51.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the critical role of PALB2 DNA binding in chromosome maintenance and HDR. We suggest that PALB2 interaction with DNA is essential for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and efficient DNA repair in cells. Moreover, our data reveal a novel activity of PALB2, which is distinct from its role as a scaffold protein linking BRCA1 and BRCA2 during HDR.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study provides new insights into the functional significance of PALB2 DNA binding in HDR and chromosome maintenance. The identification of a major DNA-binding site of PALB2 and the characterization of its N-DBD provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PALB2 function. Our findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting PALB2 in the context of breast cancer and Fanconi anemia.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Antiparallel Architecture of Prokaryotic Actin Homologue MreB: Implications for Cell Shape Maintenance and Antimicrobial Resistance

    **Research Question:** How do prokaryotic actin homologues, such as MreB, assemble and function in cell shape maintenance, and how do antimicrobial agents interact with these proteins?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including crystallography, electron microscopy, and site-specific cross-linking, to investigate the structure and function of MreB from Caulobacter crescentus.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that MreB forms pairs of antiparallel protofilaments, a novel architecture unprecedented among actin-like proteins. Crystal structures of Caulobacter MreB in different nucleotide and polymerization states demonstrate conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. We also show that a protofilament doublet is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance and that in vivo site-specific cross-linking confirms the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in E. coli. Furthermore, 3D cryo-EM reveals that pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes.

    **Implications:** The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments ensures that each subunit can interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome, facilitating cell shape maintenance. The non-polar nature of MreB filaments explains common assembly and disassembly kinetics for both filament ends. Our findings also shed light on the inhibitory mechanism of antimicrobial agents A22/MP265, which bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilizing double protofilaments.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of MreB, a prokaryotic actin homologue, and reveals a novel architecture of actin-like protofilament pairs that is unprecedented among the actin family of proteins. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of cell shape maintenance and antimicrobial resistance in prokaryotes.

    **Title:** Divergence in the Floral Regulator APETALA1 Contributes to Species-Specific Differences in Petal Number Robustness between Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic basis for the difference in petal number robustness between Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta, two closely related species?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to investigate the role of the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 (AP1) in controlling petal number in A. thaliana and C. hirsuta.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that divergence in AP1 can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness between A. thaliana and C. hirsuta. We found that A. thaliana AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling petal number in C. hirsuta. In contrast, C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of A. thaliana AP1, resulting in variable petal number. We also identified upstream regulatory regions of AP1 that contribute to this divergence.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that AP1 divergence likely exposed cryptic genetic variation in C. hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of C. hirsuta. Furthermore, our results indicate that AP1 is a key regulator of flower development in A. thaliana, acting early to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs.

    **Conclusions:** This study identifies AP1 as a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals in A. thaliana to a variable petal number in C. hirsuta. Our results highlight the importance of AP1 in controlling petal number robustness and suggest that AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to within-species variation in C. hirsuta petal number. Instead, the decanalization of petal number in C. hirsuta reflects its robustness to genetic variation.

    **Title:** Aberrant Proinsulin Misfolding and Disulfide-Linked Complexes in Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes

    **Research Question:** What is the role of proinsulin misfolding and disulfide-linked complexes in the development of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes?

    **Methods:** We investigated the biosynthesis of insulin in pancreatic islets from human and rodent models, including genetically obese mice and leptin receptor-deficient mice. We used Western blotting and non-reducing SDS-PAGE to analyze the formation of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes.

    **Main Findings:** We found that a subset of proinsulin molecules in normal pancreatic islets contains at least one free cysteine thiol, and that non-native proinsulin enters intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes in islets with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding environment. In genetically obese mice, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and in leptin receptor-deficient mice, the increase of such complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. We identified Proinsulin-Cys(B19) and Cys(A20) as necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. The formation of aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes may contribute to the development of insulin deficiency and diabetes.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that proinsulin misfolding and disulfide-linked complexes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The identification of Proinsulin-Cys(B19) and Cys(A20) as key residues involved in the formation of disulfide-linked complexes provides a structural basis for understanding aberrant proinsulin complex formation. Our findings highlight the importance of ER folding environment and β-cell function in the development of insulin deficiency and diabetes. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting proinsulin misfolding and disulfide-linked complexes in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.

    **Title:** Suv39h1’s Nucleic Acid-Binding Activity Integrates with H3K9me3 Recognition to Establish Pericentric Heterochromatin

    **Research Question:** How does Suv39h1, the major histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase, target specific chromosomal regions to assemble silent heterochromatin?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the targeting mechanisms of Suv39h1, including in vitro binding assays, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Suv39h1’s chromodomain (CD) binds nucleic acids, with a higher affinity for RNA than DNA. This nucleic acid-binding activity is essential for Suv39h1’s function in heterochromatin assembly and is independent of its recognition of trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3). We also found that Suv39h1 binds major satellite RNAs in vivo and that knockdown of these RNAs reduces Suv39h1 retention on pericentric heterochromatin. Furthermore, mutational studies revealed that both the nucleic acid-binding and H3K9me3-binding activities of Suv39h1-CD are crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating Suv39h1’s target specificity and that Suv39h1’s nucleic acid-binding activity integrates with its recognition of H3K9me3 to establish and maintain pericentric heterochromatin. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying heterochromatin assembly and the regulation of gene expression.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that Suv39h1’s nucleic acid-binding activity plays a critical role in its targeting and retention on pericentric heterochromatin, and that this activity cooperates with its recognition of H3K9me3 to establish and maintain pericentric heterochromatin. These findings provide new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying heterochromatin assembly and highlight the importance of nucleic acid-binding activity in Suv39h1’s function.

**Title:** Covert Attention Activates Spatially Structured Receptive Fields in Entorhinal Cortex

**Research Question:** Do neurons in the entorhinal cortex exhibit spatially structured receptive fields in response to movements of covert attention, independent of physical movement?

**Methods:** We recorded the activity of 141 neurons in the entorhinal cortex of two rhesus macaque monkeys performing a covert attention tracking task. The monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while attending to a small dot moving around a computer monitor. We evaluated the standard gridness measure to assess the spatial structure of the receptive fields.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that a significant population (14%) of entorhinal cells exhibited spatially structured receptive fields with a triangular tiling of space in response to movements of covert attention, without any physical movement. This is in contrast to recordings obtained in the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed.

**Implications:** Our findings provide strong evidence that the activation of cells in entorhinal cortex with spatially structured firing fields does not require physical movement through an environment. This suggests that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex may participate in a range of cognitive functions, including attentional processes. The overlap between the neural substrate for overt and covert attention (Corbetta et al., 1998) supports the hypothesis that grid cells can represent not only gaze location but also the locus of attention in general.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that entorhinal cortex neurons can exhibit spatially structured receptive fields in response to movements of covert attention, independent of physical movement. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of spatial cognition and attentional processes. The ability of entorhinal cortex neurons to represent spatial information in the absence of physical movement suggests a more general role for grid cells in cognitive functions beyond navigation. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its implications for our understanding of the neural basis of cognition.

    Title: Achieving Reproducibility in Rodent Behavior: A Standardized Task for Decision-Making in Mice

    Research Question: Can a complex mouse behavior be reproduced across multiple laboratories, and what are the implications for achieving reproducibility in neuroscience?

    Methods: We developed and implemented a standardized task to probe decision-making in head-fixed mice, which assays perceptual and value-based decision-making. We standardized training protocols, experimental hardware, software, and procedures across seven laboratories in three countries. A total of 140 mice were trained, and 5 million mouse choices were collected into a publicly available database.

    Main Findings: Despite variable learning speeds across mice and laboratories, once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results demonstrate that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories.

    Implications: Our findings establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. This study suggests a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches. By making data and techniques fully available to the broader community, we can accelerate the development of new adaptations and variations of our approach, and improve the quality and reproducibility of neural correlates of decision-making studies.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, and highlights the importance of collaborative open-science approaches in achieving reproducibility in neuroscience. By providing a standardized task and open-access tools, we aim to catalyze the use of mice in high-quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making, and ultimately advance our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.
Title: Deciphering the Intestinal Transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea Reveals Evolutionary Conservation of Digestive Physiology and Cell Types

    Abstract:
    The intricate mechanisms governing the proper function and repair of the digestive system in animals remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm capable of regenerating all organs, including the gut. Our research aimed to identify novel genes and cell types involved in intestinal physiology and regeneration.

    Methods:
    We utilized LCM to isolate intestinal cells from S. mediterranea and subjected them to RNA-seq analysis. This approach enabled the identification of hundreds of genes with intestinal expression previously undetected by other methods. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans.

    Main Findings:
    Our study revealed the regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly among intestinal goblet cells. We identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, which specifically regulate regeneration (gli-1) and maintenance (RREB2) of goblet cells. Furthermore, we discovered 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for the production and/or maintenance of goblet cells.

    Implications:
    The characterization of the planarian intestinal transcriptome provides a foundational resource for investigating mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration. Our findings highlight the evolutionary conservation of intestinal gene expression and indicate that physiological roles performed by multiple human digestive organs are consolidated in the planarian intestine.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides a comprehensive atlas of intestinal gene expression and cell types in S. mediterranea, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms governing digestive physiology and regeneration. The identification of gli-1 and RREB2 as key regulators of goblet cell differentiation and maintenance sets the stage for further studies of this cell type. The planarian intestinal transcriptome serves as a valuable resource for investigating the complex processes involved in gastrointestinal function and regeneration, ultimately contributing to our understanding of human digestive biology.

    **Title:** Divergent Sensory Coding Mechanisms in Mormyrid Fish Reveal Adaptations for Social Communication

    **Research Question:** How do evolutionary differences in sensory perception relate to the physiological coding of stimuli in Mormyrid fish, and what are the implications for social communication?

    **Methods:** We investigated the peripheral sensory coding mechanisms of Mormyrid fish, which communicate through electric organ discharges (EODs) with variable interpulse intervals (IPIs). We compared the responses of two types of sensory receptors: spiking receptors, which encode signal waveform into spike-timing differences, and oscillating receptors, which produce spontaneously oscillating potentials.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics and are correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. In contrast, spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony and suggest that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. We hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments, with oscillating receptors facilitating detection of communication signals from large groups of fish.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism for peripheral sensory coding in Mormyrid fish, where oscillating receptors respond to stimuli with phase resets, resulting in transient synchrony that encodes signal timing and location. This mechanism is specialized for detecting signals from groups of conspecifics and is correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. Our findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of sensory perception and social communication in animals.

    **Title:** Atomic Structure of Bacteriophage BPP-1 Reveals Novel Fold Topology and Insights into Phage-Display Engineering

    **Research Question:** What is the atomic structure of bacteriophage BPP-1 and how does it contribute to our understanding of phage-display engineering?

    **Methods:** We employed single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the BPP-1 head at 3.5 Å resolution. The atomic model was derived from the cryoEM map, revealing the fold topology of the major capsid protein (MCP) and cement protein (CP).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that BPP-1 MCP and CP adopt two characteristic folds of major virus lineages: jellyroll and HK-97/Johnson. Strikingly, the topology of the Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted compared to the previously known topology of the Johnson fold. We demonstrate that this new topology is the only feasible alternative to the old topology, and that β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail.

    **Implications:** The atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive to stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses. Our findings have significant implications for phage-display engineering, as the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first atomic structure of BPP-1 at 3.5 Å resolution, revealing a novel fold topology of the Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP. Our results highlight the importance of non-covalent interactions in the formation of the BPP-1 capsid and demonstrate the potential of BPP-1 as a model system for phage-display engineering. The atomic structure of BPP-1 will facilitate further research into the mechanisms of phage-display engineering and the development of novel biotechnological applications.

Title: **Adaptation of Dengue Virus Populations to Host Environments Reveals Balancing Act between Beneficial and Deleterious Mutations**

**Research Question:** How do dengue virus (DENV) populations adapt to the distinct environments of human and mosquito hosts, and what are the relative contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to this adaptation?

**Methods:** We employed serial passage of DENV in human and mosquito cell lines, followed by ultra-deep sequencing to estimate the fitness effects of all single-nucleotide variants in these populations. This approach allowed us to quantify the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population.

**Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the continuous influx of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations, shaping the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially mapped to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and clustered to defined regions in the genome. These phenotypically redundant adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. Notably, the evolutionary constraints observed in our simple system mirrored trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating that our findings recapitulate key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between beneficial and deleterious mutations in shaping the evolution of viral populations. The identification of host-specific beneficial mutations and their clustering in specific regions of the DENV genome provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of selection and adaptation operating on DENV populations in cells and host populations.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that adaptation of DENV populations relies on a balance between the dynamics of rare beneficial mutations and the significant and constantly replenished load of deleterious alleles. The identification of "hotspots" of host-specific selection in the DENV genome and proteome provides a framework for understanding the evolutionary paths of DENV in distinct cellular environments. These findings have important implications for the development of effective strategies to combat DENV infection and transmission.

    **Title:** Membrane Nanodomains Dictate KRasG12D Diffusion and Trafficking in U2OS Cells

    **Research Question:** How do membrane nanodomains influence the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D, an active KRas mutant, in U2OS cells?

    **Methods:** We employed single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and detailed trajectory analysis to investigate the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D in U2OS cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that KRasG12D exhibits distinct membrane diffusion and trafficking properties, partitioning into three states: an immobile state (~70 nm domains), an intermediate mobility state (~200 nm domains), and a fast diffusion state. Notably, KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling, revealing how membrane organization dictates membrane diffusion and trafficking of Ras. The results suggest that membrane nanodomains play a crucial role in regulating KRasG12D diffusion and trafficking, with implications for Ras multimer formation and signaling.

    **Conclusions:** We propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D. Our study sheds new light on the complex nanodomains that organize on the membrane to regulate Ras diffusion and trafficking, offering useful guidance for future experiments aimed at determining the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and defining the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Signaling Gradient Formation in Zebrafish Embryos: A Source-Sink Mechanism Revealed

    Abstract:

    Background: Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play a crucial role in patterning the dorsoventral (DV) embryonic axis of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates suggests that BMP gradient formation is achieved through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often accompanied by ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear.

    Research Question: What is the mechanism of BMP signaling gradient formation in zebrafish embryos?

    Methods: We employed a robust quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient in wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos. We combined these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation.

    Main Findings: Our analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a bmp transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism. Surprisingly, our results support a fourth model, a source-sink mechanism, where a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acts as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. We measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of BMP signaling gradient formation in zebrafish embryos, challenging the prevailing view of a counter-gradient mechanism. The source-sink mechanism highlights the importance of BMP antagonist distribution in shaping the BMP signaling gradient.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals a novel mechanism of BMP signaling gradient formation in zebrafish embryos, shedding light on the complex interactions between BMP ligands and antagonists during development. The source-sink mechanism provides a new framework for understanding the patterning of the DV axis in vertebrates and invertebrates, with implications for our understanding of developmental biology and disease.

    **Title:** Characterization of MFSD1, a Novel Lysosomal Transporter, and Its Essential Accessory Subunit GLMP

    **Research Question:** What is the role of MFSD1, a hitherto uncharacterized lysosomal family member of the major facilitator superfamily, in cellular degradation and homeostasis?

    **Methods:** We generated Mfsd1 knockout (KO) mice to investigate the physiological functions of MFSD1. Lysosomes from wildtype and Mfsd1 KO mice were isolated by differential centrifugation and sucrose-gradient centrifugation. Proteomics analysis revealed GLMP as an essential accessory subunit for MFSD1. Physical interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP was confirmed.

    **Main Findings:** MFSD1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady-state conditions, is not N-glycosylated, and is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues. Its transport to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus. Mfsd1 KO mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics analysis of isolated lysosomes from Mfsd1 KO mice revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. GLMP is essential for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes and vice versa. Glmp KO mice mimic the phenotype of Mfsd1 KO mice.

    **Implications:** Our data reveal a tightly linked MFSD1/GLMP lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex. The deficiency of MFSD1 leads to drastically reduced levels of GLMP and vice versa. These findings suggest that MFSD1 and GLMP play essential roles in the homeostasis of the liver and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs).

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a detailed characterization of MFSD1, a novel lysosomal transporter, and its essential accessory subunit GLMP. The MFSD1/GLMP complex is crucial for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes, and its deficiency leads to severe liver disease and splenomegaly. These findings highlight the importance of MFSD1 and GLMP in cellular degradation and homeostasis, and provide new insights into the regulation of lysosomal function.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Kinesin’s Microtubule-Attached Cycle: Insights from High-Resolution Cryo-EM Reconstructions

    Abstract:

    Background: Microtubule-based transport by kinesin motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, is essential for various cellular processes in eukaryotes. Understanding the molecular mechanism of kinesin’s microtubule-attached cycle is crucial for elucidating its function.

    Research Question: What is the structural basis of kinesin’s nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules, and how do microtubules regulate kinesin’s affinities for ADP and ATP?

    Methods: We obtained high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of the human monomeric kinesin motor domain (K349) attached to microtubules in two different chemical states: no-nucleotide and ADP•aluminum fluoride (ADP•Al•Fx). We developed atomic models for these states and compared them with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin.

    Main Findings: Our results reveal a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved ‘linchpin’ residue in kinesin (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft, tightly coupling to translocation of cargo via kinesin’s ‘neck linker’ element. This structural transition is reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in myosin and F1-ATPase motors.

    Implications: Our findings provide a structural basis for kinesin’s nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules, revealing how microtubules regulate kinesin’s affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops. This uncouples the motor’s nucleotide affinity from its microtubule affinity, allowing microtubules to regulate kinesin’s activity.

    Conclusions: Our study elucidates the mechanism of kinesin’s microtubule-attached cycle, providing insights into the structural basis of kinesin’s nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules. These findings have significant implications for understanding the regulation of kinesin’s activity and its role in various cellular processes.

    **Research Question:** How do cells maintain the essential functions of mitochondria by recognizing and removing misfolded proteins?

    **Methods:** We used temperature-sensitive (ts-) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins, sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, as model substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the quality control (QC) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins.

    **Main Findings:** We found that ts- proteins are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts is ubiquitinated primarily by San1. Mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. Additionally, the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1, and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are implicated in their degradation.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguish it from other cellular QC pathways. This pathway highlights the importance of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the turnover of misfolded mitochondrial proteins.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial protein quality control and suggest that the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex plays a crucial role in the degradation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates. This study has significant implications for our understanding of mitochondrial function and dysfunction, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial protein misfolding. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this novel QC pathway and its relevance to human disease.

    **Title:** Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD) in the Epidermis: A Novel Mechanism of Cell Proliferation Regulation

    **Research Question:** How is extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity regulated and propagated in the epidermis, and what is its role in cell cycle progression?

    **Methods:** We used transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK to visualize ERK activity in living epidermal cells at single-cell resolution. Long-term imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, which we termed Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD). We investigated the mechanism of ERK propagation and its role in cell cycle progression.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SPREADs are bursts of ERK activation that originate from a few cells and propagate radially up to 50 μm over 30 minutes. The frequency of SPREADs correlates with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs are stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagates as a trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, we found that SPREADs are associated with G2/M cell cycle progression.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronized in a living tissue. The discovery of SPREADs reveals a novel mechanism of ERK activity regulation, which is essential for homeostasis in the epidermis and other tissues.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ERK activity is dynamically regulated in the epidermis through SPREADs, which are bursts of ERK activation that propagate radially and are associated with cell cycle progression. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how growth signal activation is generated and propagated throughout the tissue, and highlight the importance of ERK activity regulation in maintaining tissue homeostasis.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Principles of Circadian Rhythm Entrainment: A Mathematical Framework for Predicting Clock Behavior in Varying Environments

    **Research Question:** What are the underlying principles that govern the entrainment of circadian rhythms in response to external cues, and can a mathematical framework be developed to predict clock behavior in various environmental conditions?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments using the cyanobacterial circadian clock as a model system. The authors reconstituted the core oscillator responsible for driving genome-wide transcriptional rhythms using purified Kai proteins and simulated seasonal effects by driving the Kai proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24-hour cycle.

    **Main Findings:** The results show that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day length. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. A general mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues was developed, which successfully predicts clock behavior under many cycling environments.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study provide new insights into the principles of circadian rhythm entrainment and suggest that the ability to track midday is an intrinsic property of the core oscillator. The mathematical framework developed in this study can be used to guide the design of experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features and may be applicable to clocks in many organisms.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that the entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a mathematical framework with a small number of parameters. The precisely defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, and the model is general, making it useful for other organisms as well. The results of this study have significant implications for our understanding of circadian biology and may lead to the development of new approaches for predicting and manipulating clock behavior in various environmental conditions.

    **Title:** Meis1 Inactivation Disrupts Sympatho-Vagal Regulation of Cardiac Rhythmicity and Increases Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death

    **Background:** Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of premature death in the general population, yet its origins remain unidentified in many cases. Genome-wide association studies have implicated Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD.

    **Research Question:** Does Meis1 inactivation in the mouse neural crest lead to altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity and increased susceptibility to SCD?

    **Methods:** We used a mouse model to inactivate Meis1 in the neural crest and examined the effects on cardiac rhythmicity, sympathetic target-field innervation, and endosomal machinery.

    **Main Findings:** Meis1 inactivation in the mouse neural crest resulted in altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, increasing susceptibility to SCD. We demonstrated that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1-deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. Furthermore, we showed that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, leading to impaired traffic of Rab5+ endosomes in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that Meis1 plays a crucial role in the differentiation of sympathetic neurons and that its inactivation leads to neurodevelopmental defects, resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. We position Meis1 as a novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation by its role in distal target-field innervation.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of Meis1 in the regulation of cardiac rhythmicity and increases our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SCD. Our findings suggest that Meis1 mutations could mediate susceptibility to unexplained SCD by disrupting sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions. These results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent SCD.

**Title:** Mechanical Instabilities and Interfacial Energies Drive Biofilm Morphogenesis in Vibrio cholerae

**Research Question:** How do mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies contribute to the morphogenesis of biofilms in Vibrio cholerae?

**Methods:** We employed a multi-disciplinary approach combining mechanical measurements, theory and simulation, quantitative image analyses, surface energy characterizations, and mutagenesis to investigate the morphogenesis of Vibrio cholerae biofilms.

**Main Findings:** Our study reveals that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis program of growing biofilms. We demonstrate that interfacial energy is a key driving force for mechanomorphogenesis, dictating the generation of new and the annihilation of existing interfaces. Furthermore, we show that feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that mechanical principles play a crucial role in biofilm morphogenesis, and that exploiting these principles could lead to new strategies for addressing biofilm-related problems. The morphogenesis principles discovered in bacterial biofilms, which rely on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, are likely to be generally applicable to morphogenesis processes in tissues in higher organisms.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying biofilm morphogenesis and highlights the importance of mechanical forces in shaping biofilm surface morphology. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of morphogenesis processes in eukaryotes and suggest that biofilms represent a tractable model system for investigating the general role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis. Moreover, our study provides a framework for morpho-engineering biofilms, which could lead to the discovery of new genes and/or compounds that alter biofilm morphology by altering mechanics. Ultimately, this research has the potential to contribute to the development of novel strategies for addressing biofilm-related problems in various fields, including medicine and biotechnology.

    **Title:** Dynamic Regulation of NRSF Target Genes Contributes to Epileptogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF/REST) in the development of epileptic neuronal networks following insults such as severe seizures?

    **Methods:** We employed large-scale transcriptome arrays, quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate the mechanisms underlying NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis.

    **Main Findings:** We found that epilepsy-provoking seizures increased NRSF levels in the mature hippocampus several-fold, yet surprisingly, only a subset (∼10%) of potential NRSF target genes were repressed. Notably, the repressed gene-set was rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked. Furthermore, we discovered that genes selectively repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, making them sensitive to moderate fluctuations of NRSF levels.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a crucial role in influencing neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts. Specifically, the repression of a subset of NRSF target genes, which code for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function, may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms generating epileptic neuronal networks following insults such as severe seizures. Our results highlight the importance of NRSF in regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function, and suggest that dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes may be a key factor in the development of epilepsy. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying epilepsy and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disorder.

    **Title:** Emergence of Feature Selectivity in Parallel Olfactory Pathways via Distinct Lateral Inhibitory Circuits

    **Research Question:** How do local circuits in parallel sensory pathways, such as those formed by mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory system, maintain or enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features?

    **Methods:** We investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory system of mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells, which likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying feature selectivity in parallel sensory pathways and highlight the importance of lateral inhibitory circuits in shaping the responses of mitral and tufted cells. These results have implications for our understanding of sensory processing in the olfactory system and may be relevant to other sensory systems, such as the visual system, where parallel processing is also a key feature.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the emergence of feature selectivity in parallel sensory pathways is not solely dependent on the properties of individual neurons, but rather on the interactions between neurons within local circuits. The distinct lateral inhibitory circuits in mitral and tufted cells allow them to encode different aspects of the stimulus, enabling the olfactory system to process complex odor information more efficiently. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sensory processing and may have implications for the development of novel computational models of sensory systems.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular and Supramolecular Determinants of Allostery in the M2 Muscarinic Receptor: A Comparative Study of Monomers and Oligomers

    Abstract:
    The M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allostery in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has been extensively studied, yet the molecular and supramolecular determinants of its allosteric effects remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the allosteric properties of monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor using a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Our results reveal that allosteric effects in monomers are exclusively negative and arise from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, allosteric effects in oligomers can be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arise from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. Molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic level further elucidated the complex behavior of oligomers, which is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. These findings provide new insights into the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor and highlight the importance of considering the oligomeric nature of GPCRs in understanding their allosteric behavior.

    Research Question:
    What are the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor, and how do they differ between monomers and oligomers?

    Methods:
    We employed a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects to compare the allosteric properties of monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor. Molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic level were used to examine the electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that allosteric effects in monomers are exclusively negative and arise from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, allosteric effects in oligomers can be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arise from interactions within and between the constituent protomers.

    Implications:
    These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor and highlight the importance of considering the oligomeric nature of GPCRs in understanding their allosteric behavior.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor and demonstrates the complex behavior of oligomers, which is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting GPCRs and highlight the need for further research into the oligomeric nature of these receptors.

    **Title:** Histone Modification by SETD2 Facilitates DNA Damage Response and Repair

    **Research Question:** What is the role of SETD2, a histone methyltransferase, in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)?

    **Methods:** We employed RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of SETD2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells to investigate its role in DNA damage response (DDR) and repair. We used reporter assays to assess ATM activation, γH2AX and 53BP1 phosphorylation, and RAD51 presynaptic filament formation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SETD2 is necessary for ATM activation upon DNA DSBs, and its depletion impairs homologous recombination repair of DSBs by reducing RAD51 presynaptic filament formation. Furthermore, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome, and exhibited decreased cell survival after DNA damage.

    **Implications:** These findings reveal a novel role for SETD2 in establishing chromatin states that coordinate the DDR and repair of DSBs. The loss of SETD2 in ccRCC may provide an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that SETD2 acts as a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. Unlike other histone modifications that promote the DDR, SETD2 does not increase H3K36me3 levels at DNA damage sites or recruit SETD2 to DSBs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR and highlight the importance of chromatin states in maintaining genome integrity. The identification of SETD2 mutations in several cancers, including ccRCC, underscores the need for further studies to elucidate the role of SETD2 in cancer development and progression.

    **Title:** A Missense Variant in Rasgrp1 Disrupts mTOR Signaling and Triggers Autoimmune Dysregulation in CD4+ T Cells

    **Research Question:** How does a missense variant in the Rasgrp1 gene, Rasgrp1Anaef, contribute to the development of autoimmune dysregulation in CD4+ T cells?

    **Methods:** We generated a mouse model of Rasgrp1Anaef, a missense variant with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. We analyzed the effects of Rasgrp1Anaef on CD4+ T cell development, function, and autoantibody production in vivo and in vitro.

    **Main Findings:** Rasgrp1Anaef mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and accumulate a CD44hi Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in Rasgrp1Anaef is mostly normal in vivo. However, CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. We identified CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in Mtor. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in Rasgrp1Anaef naïve CD4+ T cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells. The Rasgrp1Anaef missense variant increases tonic mTOR signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells, leading to two abnormalities: (1) constitutive increase in CD44 expression and (2) gradual accumulation of peripheral Helios+ CD44hi CD4 cells and autoantibodies.

    **Conclusions:** Genetic reduction of mTOR function in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalizes CD44 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells and abolishes excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in Rasgrp1Anaef mice. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases and highlight the importance of mTOR signaling in regulating CD4+ T cell function.

    **Title:** Arid1a Modulates Kras-Dependent Acinar Cell Reprogramming in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

    **Research Question:** How do mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family, specifically Arid1a, contribute to the initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the presence of oncogenic KrasG12D?

    **Methods:** We employed a mouse model with inducible and reversible suppression of Arid1a in the pancreas, concurrent with oncogenic KrasG12D expression, to investigate the role of Arid1a in PDAC initiation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that postnatal silencing of Arid1a following sustained KrasG12D expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. Furthermore, suppression of Arid1a in adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic Kras mutations accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous, pancreatic cancer precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Arid1a acts as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and underscore the importance of timing and genetic context in the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis. We propose that Arid1a provides a potent barrier to Kras-driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and early-stage pancreatic neoplasia.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the complex interplay between Arid1a, Kras, and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex in the regulation of pancreas cell identity. We demonstrate that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PDAC initiation and suggest that Arid1a may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Title: Sex-Specific Effects of Social Isolation on Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) Neurons in Mice

Background: Social networks play a crucial role in buffering the effects of stress, but the absence of a social network can also be stressful. We investigated the effects of social isolation on the intrinsic properties of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in mice.

Research Question: Do social isolation and acute physical stress have sex-specific effects on the biophysical properties of CRH neurons in mice?

Methods: We isolated preadolescent female and male mice from their littermates for 24 hours and examined the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in the PVN using acute brain slices. We also subjected group-housed females and single-housed males to acute physical stress (swim stress) and examined the effects on CRH neurons.

Main Findings: We found that social isolation increased first spike latency (FSL) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons in female mice, but not in age-matched male mice. In contrast, acute physical stress increased FSL in group-housed females and single-housed males. The increase in FSL following social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone.

Implications: Our findings demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons. These results suggest that female mice may interpret social isolation as a stress, leading to changes in the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons.

Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the sex-specific effects of social isolation and acute physical stress on CRH neurons in mice. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sex differences in stress responses and may inform the development of sex-specific treatments for stress-related disorders.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Optimization of Hemoglobin Affinity and Cooperativity for Tissue Oxygen Delivery in Mammals

    **Background:** Hemoglobin (Hb) is a model protein for studying molecular adaptation in vertebrates. While both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb affect tissue oxygen delivery, only affinity was previously thought to determine molecular adaptations of Hb.

    **Research Question:** Do Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize tissue oxygen delivery in mammals?

    **Methods:** We derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ describing this relation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape, allowing for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb.

    **Implications:** The generality and implications of our findings suggest that evolutionary tuning of mammalian Hb maximum cooperativity and affinity points, achieved by co-varying the relative affinity and conformational ratio of its quaternary states, regulates tissue oxygen delivery by Hb and serves as one means to meet the distinct needs of different animal tissues for oxygen.

    **Conclusions:** Our results support the hypothesis that changes in mammalian Hb binding and conformation have been tuned during evolution, giving rise to close to maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding, albeit yielding a different maximum nH value in each case. Furthermore, we found that the greater an animal’s metabolic rate, the higher was the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb, and an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Motility and Vasculature Interaction of Plasmodium Sporozoites in the Mammalian Host

    **Research Question:** How do Plasmodium sporozoites navigate and interact with dermal blood vessels after injection by an Anopheles mosquito?

    **Methods:** We employed intravital microscopy in mice to investigate the motility and interaction of Plasmodium sporozoites with dermal blood vessels over the first 2 hours after intradermal inoculation.

    **Main Findings:** Our data reveal that sporozoites exhibit two distinct types of motility: 'avascular motility' characterized by high speed and less confinement in regions far from blood vessels, and 'perivascular motility' characterized by more constrained movement in the vicinity of blood vessels. We found that curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Furthermore, imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlighted the importance of gliding speed and adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the complex process of sporozoite navigation and interaction with dermal blood vessels. The identification of two distinct types of motility suggests that sporozoites adapt their behavior in response to environmental cues, allowing them to optimize their chances of entering the blood circulation. Our findings also underscore the importance of gliding speed and adhesive properties for successful blood vessel invasion and infectivity.

    **Conclusions:** This study refines our understanding of how Plasmodium sporozoites navigate through and out of the dermis, highlighting the critical role of motility and vasculature interaction in the early stages of malaria infection. Our data suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite, providing a potential target for intervention to prevent malaria transmission. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel strategies to prevent malaria infection and highlight the importance of further research into the biology of Plasmodium sporozoites.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Robustness of Cells to Physiologically Destructive Perturbations: A Case Study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** How do cells adapt to the removal of a crucial component of a functional module, and what are the implications for our understanding of evolutionary robustness?

    **Methods:** We conducted an evolutionary experiment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deleting the polarity gene BEM1 and allowing the cells to evolve for 1000 generations under strong selective pressure. We sequenced the genomes of the evolved lineages and monitored their polarization dynamics.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the bem1∆ lineages rapidly increased in fitness and eventually reached >90% of the fitness of their BEM1 ancestors. Genome sequencing revealed a common evolutionary trajectory, characterized by a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations that improved cell polarization by inactivating proteins. These mutations led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that cells can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations, and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. This suggests that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt to strong perturbations. The larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of cellular functions and the robustness of cells to perturbations. They suggest that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins, and that gene inactivation can be a key mechanism for adaptation to strong selective pressure. This study provides new insights into the evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has broader implications for our understanding of the evolution of cellular functions in general.

    **Title:** Neural Mechanisms of Economic Commitment: A Study of Value Encoding in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex

    **Research Question:** How do humans integrate value signals over time when making economic commitments, and what neural mechanisms are involved in this process?

    **Methods:** In this study, we used a multi-alternative choice task to investigate the neural mechanisms of economic commitment in humans. Participants were presented with a series of choices between accepting or rejecting prospects that provided sustained financial returns. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activity in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) while participants made these decisions.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the rmPFC encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. In contrast, the dACC encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected (or deferred accepting) a prospect. Furthermore, dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases: a tendency to defer commitments to later and a tendency to weight potential losses more heavily than gains. These biases paradoxically maximized reward in this task.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of economic decision-making and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex. The results suggest that the rmPFC plays a critical role in integrating value signals over time, while the dACC is involved in encoding value when decisions involve rejection or deferral. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pressures that shape economic decisions and the neural mechanisms that underlie them.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms of economic commitment and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of value encoding in economic decision-making and the role of the dACC in encoding value when decisions involve rejection or deferral. These findings have important implications for our understanding of economic behavior and the neural mechanisms that underlie it.

    **Title:** Circadian Regulation of Gene Expression by Paraspeckles in Pituitary Cells

    **Research Question:** Do paraspeckles, nuclear bodies formed around long non-coding RNA Neat1 and RNA-binding proteins, play a role in controlling circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level in pituitary cells?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression patterns of paraspeckle components, including four major proteins and Neat1, in rat pituitary cells. We also examined the effect of inserting inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu) at the 3'-UTR of the EGFP cDNA on mRNA retention and protein expression.

    **Main Findings:** We found that all components of paraspeckles displayed a circadian expression pattern in pituitary cells. The insertion of IRAlu at the 3'-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA, which was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. In contrast, the insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, we showed that IRAlu drove a circadian expression of EGFP protein.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that paraspeckles control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus. The circadian expression of paraspeckle components and their ability to retain IRAlu-containing mRNAs provide an additional layer of gene regulation in pituitary cells.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that paraspeckles play a crucial role in controlling circadian gene expression in pituitary cells. The circadian expression of paraspeckle components and their ability to retain IRAlu-containing mRNAs provide a novel mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and gene regulation in pituitary cells.

    **Title:** Munc13 Controls Presynaptic Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Function through Direct Interaction

    **Research Question:** How does Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, regulate presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) function during various forms of activity?

    **Methods:** Using in vitro experiments, we investigated the interaction between Munc13 and VGCCs in nerve terminals. We demonstrated that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs via a pair of basic residues in its C2B domain and that this interaction is critical for controlling VGCC function.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that elimination of the Munc13-VGCC interaction by either removing Munc13 or replacing it with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters synaptic VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. Specifically, we found that Munc13 enhances Ca2+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions.

    **Implications:** These findings have broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled. Our data suggest that the Munc13-VGCC interaction is a novel form of synaptic modulation that can actively control synaptic throughput by regulating both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis. Our results provide compelling evidence that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs in a way that controls calcium channel use-dependence on millisecond to second time scales at nerve terminals. The identification of a critical interaction site in Munc13's C2B domain highlights a new class of mechanisms for sculpting synaptic efficacy. These findings have significant implications for understanding the complex interplay between presynaptic proteins and VGCCs in regulating synaptic transmission.

    **Title:** Puzzle-Shaped Cells in Plant Epidermis: A Mechanistic Link between Cell Shape and Mechanical Stress

    **Research Question:** What is the functional benefit of puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants, and how do they adapt to mechanical stress in isotropically growing tissues?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate the relationship between cell shape and mechanical stress in the epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. We analyzed the stress in a mechanical model of the cotyledon epidermis using Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis and tested our hypothesis using mutants with perturbed growth direction.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of isodiametric plant organs, such as broad leaves and cotyledons, provide an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall. We found that the lobes and indentations in puzzle-shaped cells prevent the formation of large isodiametric cells that would bulge under the stress produced by turgor pressure. Furthermore, our simulation models suggest that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the functional benefit of puzzle-shaped cells in plant epidermis and highlight the importance of mechanical stress as a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis. We propose that the puzzle shape is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces that act on turgid plant cells in the epidermis.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study reveals a mechanistic link between cell shape and mechanical stress in the epidermis of plants. We demonstrate that puzzle-shaped cells in isodiametric plant organs provide a means to avoid large open areas in the cell and the high stresses that they induce. Our results suggest that plant cells regulate their shape to prevent excessive mechanical stress, which is a critical factor in plant growth and development. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between cell shape, mechanical stress, and tissue growth in plants.

    **Title:** Synergistic Interactions between Cross-Intron and Cross-Exon Processes Promote Efficient Pre-Spliceosome Assembly in Human Cells

    **Research Question:** How do cross-intron and cross-exon interactions jointly contribute to the assembly of pre-spliceosomes on multi-intron pre-mRNA molecules in human cells?

    **Methods:** We employed single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (CoSMoS) to investigate the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on individual pre-mRNA molecules in human nuclear extracts. Fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes were used to visualize interactions between U1 and U2 subcomplexes and the 5' splice sites of introns and exons.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the binding of U1 subcomplex to the 5' splice site of an intron acts synergistically with the binding of U1 to the 5' splice site of the next intron to increase the rate and efficiency of U2 subcomplex recruitment to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. This synergy is mediated by the flanking 5' splice sites, which have greater than additive effects on U2 recruitment.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that cross-intron and cross-exon interactions play a crucial role in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs in human cells. The synergy between 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely essential for ensuring accurate and efficient pre-spliceosome assembly.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pre-spliceosome assembly in human cells. The ordered pathway of pre-spliceosome assembly, which requires prior U1 binding and stable U2 association in the presence of ATP, is distinct from the branched pathway observed in S. cerevisiae. Our results highlight the importance of cross-intron and cross-exon interactions in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs, and provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to this remarkable accuracy.

    **Title:** A Novel Ubiquitination-Dependent Folding System for Membrane Proteins on the Cytosolic Side of the Endoplasmic Reticulum

    **Research Question:** How do membrane proteins fold efficiently on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and what role does ubiquitination play in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 and other membrane proteins, including CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2, using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a novel ubiquitination-dependent folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER. Upon synthesis, LRP6 undergoes site-specific ubiquitination on a specific lysine residue (Lys-1403), which retains it in the ER and prevents degradation. Subsequent removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19 allows LRP6 to exit the ER. This ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle is reminiscent of the glucosylation-deglucosylation cycle in the ER lumen. Folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted to degradation.

    **Implications:** This ubiquitin-dependent folding system not only controls the proteostasis of LRP6 but also regulates the folding of other membrane proteins, including CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2, which are involved in severe human diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings reveal a novel assisted-folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER and depends on site-specific cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquitination. This system provides a mechanism for the efficient folding of membrane proteins, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing protein misfolding diseases. The discovery of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system has important implications for understanding the regulation of membrane protein folding and the development of therapeutic strategies for protein misfolding diseases.

**Title:** Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes in value-based decision making: A computational analysis of exploration and exploitation in mice

**Research Question:** Do sex differences exist in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task, and if so, how do these differences contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders?

**Methods:** We used a restless two-armed bandit task to investigate sex differences in exploration and exploitation in mice. Male and female mice were trained on the task, and their behavior was analyzed using computational tools, including Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that male and female mice had similar accuracy in the task, but they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, whereas female mice explored less but learned more quickly during exploration. Post-hoc win-stay lose-shift analyses revealed that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, indicating that they were more likely to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for sex differences in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task. These differences in exploration and exploitation strategies may contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to understand how sex, explore-exploit states, and reward outcomes interact to influence animal choices, and how these findings can be translated to humans.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Membrane Protein Extraction by the Ubiquitin Ligase Doa10

    **Research Question:** How do hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments of membrane proteins move from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol during endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD)?

    **Methods:** We employed a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 in membrane protein extraction.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Doa10 acts as a retrotranslocase, facilitating the extraction of membrane proteins from the ER membrane. We show that the TM segment of a substrate protein interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10, allowing it to passively move into the aqueous phase. In contrast, luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with unfolding occurring on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the ERAD pathway, revealing how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction. This understanding is crucial for elucidating the quality control pathways for membrane proteins, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study resolves a long-standing question regarding the folding state of luminal domains during retrotranslocation, demonstrating that they are extracted in an unfolded state. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of ERAD and its role in maintaining protein homeostasis in the cell. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of Doa10 as a retrotranslocase in the ERAD pathway, providing a framework for future studies on the regulation of membrane protein quality control.

    **Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Hedgehog Signaling in Drosophila Wing Imaginal Discs

    **Background:** Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a crucial role in development and tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Aberrant Hh signaling has been implicated in various developmental birth defects and cancers.

    **Research Question:** What are the contributions of proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to dose-dependent Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs?

    **Methods:** We used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to investigate the contributions of proteolytic processing to Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor. This suggests that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. Furthermore, processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2 or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that wing patterning by Hh does not require regulation of the level of either repressor or full-length Ci protein by processing. This has significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of Hh signaling and its role in development and disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that Ci can mediate normal Hh morphogen action in wing discs in the complete absence of regulated processing. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of Hh signaling and have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for Hh-related disorders.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Calretinin-Expressing Interneurons in Spinal Pain Signaling: An Optogenetic Approach

    Abstract:

    Research Question: What is the functional role of calretinin-expressing interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in pain signaling?

    Methods: This study employed an optogenetic approach to selectively activate calretinin-expressing interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that calretinin-expressing interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, directly relaying signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of these interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior, conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that dorsal horn circuits involving excitatory calretinin-expressing neurons are crucial for the generation and amplification of pain, identifying these interneurons as a potential target for future analgesic therapies.

    Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into the functional role of calretinin-expressing interneurons in spinal pain signaling, highlighting their capacity to amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemically-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn positions them to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers. Future studies should investigate how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing to further elucidate their role in pain perception.

    **Title:** RAB23 Regulates Skull Development by Coordinating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 and Hh-GLI1 Signaling Pathways

    **Research Question:** What is the role of RAB23 in regulating skull development, particularly in the context of polysyndactyly and craniosynostosis?

    **Methods:** We generated Rab23-deficient (Rab23-/-) mice that survived until embryonic day (E) 18.5, allowing us to investigate the effects of RAB23 deficiency on bone formation. We analyzed the expression of various genes involved in skull development, including Pitx2, Fgf10, Fgfr1b, p38, pERK1/2, RUNX2, and GLI1.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that disruption of RAB23 leads to upregulation of Pitx2, Fgf10, and Fgfr1b expression, decreased p38, and enhanced pERK1/2-RUNX2 signaling, along with elevated osteoprogenitor proliferation. We also found that RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, represses Hh signaling, and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion. Furthermore, RAB23 represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling, which has multiple effects on osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation, and GLI1 repression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity and the activation of GLI1. RAB23 also controls suture morphogenesis and patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling, the repression of Hh targets through a canonical pathway, and the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream regulator of both FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1 signaling pathways, as well as the additional regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying skull development and craniosynostosis, and highlight the importance of RAB23 in coordinating the initiation of osteogenesis. Our results also suggest that RAB23 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of craniosynostosis and other developmental disorders.

    Title: Epigenetic Memory of Gene Expression States is Stored in Cis at the Polycomb Target Gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis

    Background: The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states (cis memory) or if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory).

    Research Question: Can Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene instruct its own inheritance and constitute a cis memory system?

    Methods: To address this question, we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis. We crossed FLC-mCherry to FLC-Venus plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene and monitored the expression of FLC in the same plants.

    Main Findings: We show that one copy of FLC can be repressed while the other is active, and this'mixed' expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. Furthermore, we demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans but in cis.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and constitute a cis memory system. This challenges the prevailing view that epigenetic memory is stored in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors (trans memory).

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that epigenetic memory of gene expression states is stored in cis at the Polycomb target gene FLC in Arabidopsis. This has significant implications for our understanding of how cells'remember' past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, and how epigenetic information is inherited through cell division. Our findings highlight the importance of cis memory in the regulation of gene expression and provide new insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance.

    **Title:** Oligomerization of Endoplasmic Reticulum Hsp70 Chaperone BiP: A Mechanism for Buffering Unfolded Protein Load in the Endoplasmic Reticulum

    **Research Question:** What is the structure and functional significance of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70 chaperone BiP, and how do these oligomers contribute to the regulation of unfolded protein load in the ER?

    **Methods:** Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of BiP oligomers, while native gel electrophoresis was employed to investigate the relationship between unfolded protein load and BiP oligomerization.

    **Main Findings:** BiP oligomers were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, which attenuates the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, indicating the relative inertness of the oligomers. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers, as well as slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that BiP oligomerization is a mechanism for buffering fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale, which is attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response. The oligomeric form of BiP is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short timescale.

    **Conclusions:** Our results paint a coherent picture of how enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele. The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the UPR and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the regulation of unfolded protein load in the ER and the role of Hsp70 chaperones in maintaining protein homeostasis.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into the Coat Protein of Pepino Mosaic Virus: Implications for Flexuous Filamentous Viruses

    **Research Question:** What is the three-dimensional structure of the coat protein (CP) of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the genus Potexvirus, and how does it interact with viral RNA?

    **Methods:** We employed electron cryomicroscopy to determine the structure of PepMV at 3.9 Å resolution, allowing us to model the CP and its interactions with viral RNA.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped (-) ssRNA viruses. However, the main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP lies in their C-terminal extensions, which determine the characteristics of distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein.

    **Implications:** The structural homology between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-) ssRNA viruses. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and diversity of flexuous filamentous viruses, which are economically important plant pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first high-resolution structure of a potexvirus CP and sheds light on its interactions with viral RNA. The structural homology between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP highlights the possibility of gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-) ssRNA viruses. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution and diversity of flexuous filamentous viruses and may inform the development of novel strategies for controlling these economically important plant pathogens.

    **Title:** SiteLoc: An Imaging-Based Method for Nanometer-Scale Localization of Antibody Binding Sites on Native Cell Surface Proteins

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a fast and efficient method for imaging-based molecular localization of antibody binding sites on native cell surface proteins with nanometer-scale precision?

    **Methods:** We have developed a novel method, SiteLoc, for imaging-based molecular localization of antibody binding sites on native cell surface proteins. This method utilizes topological image averaging to achieve nanometer-scale resolution in one dimension, specifically the distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that SiteLoc is well-suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and can be applied to other molecular distance estimations as well. We show that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on both spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces. Site localization measurements for ligands on bacterial M protein agree well with previously reported data.

    **Implications:** Fast and efficient screening of epitope locations can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Knowing the location of the epitope greatly aids both mechanistic understanding and facilitates potential therapeutic development. Our method addresses the limitations of existing techniques, which are costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a novel imaging-based method, SiteLoc, for nanometer-scale localization of antibody binding sites on native cell surface proteins. Our results demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of this method, which can be applied to various molecular distance estimations. SiteLoc has the potential to revolutionize the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines by enabling fast and efficient screening of epitope locations. This method can also facilitate mechanistic understanding of host-target interactions, ultimately leading to improved therapeutic outcomes.

    **Title:** Peripheral Oxygen Sensing in the Skin Regulates Systemic Cardiovascular Response to Hypoxia

    **Research Question:** How does the hypoxic response in peripheral tissues, specifically the skin, influence systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation in vertebrates?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors in the skin of mice in response to a 10% oxygen challenge. We analyzed the effects of loss of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2, and Arg-1 expression in keratinocytes on systemic cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression in keratinocytes plays a crucial role in the immediate, acute, and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. Mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2, and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis showed significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures relative to littermate control animals. We propose a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin, which suggests that hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO-mediated increase in vascular diameter and resulting increases in perfusion, followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of peripheral oxygen sensing in the skin in regulating systemic cardiovascular response to hypoxia. Our results demonstrate that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia, and that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance, and highlight the importance of considering the role of peripheral tissues in systemic cardiovascular regulation.

    **Title:** Refining Optogenetic Methods for Circuit Mapping with Single-Neuron Resolution

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a refined optogenetic approach to map functional synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution, overcoming the limitations of current methods?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel combination of temporal focusing for two-photon activation of channelrhodopsin (ChR2) and restricted ChR2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This approach allowed us to reliably evoke action potentials in individual neurons, verify spike generation with GCaMP6s, and determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections using patch-clamp electrophysiological recording.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that this refined optogenetic method enables the measurement of functional synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. By restricting ChR2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites, we minimized the risk of unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons, which are known to respond to temporal focusing of two-photon excitation.

    **Implications:** The ability to map functional synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution is crucial for understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among distinct types of neurons that comprise neural circuits. This knowledge is essential for elucidating circuit function and has significant implications for the interpretation of sensory input and production of behavioral responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a significant advancement in optogenetic methods for circuit mapping, enabling the reliable evaluation of synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. By combining temporal focusing with restricted ChR2 expression, we have overcome the limitations of current methods, providing a powerful tool for understanding the synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits. This refined approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit function and has far-reaching implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complex Interactions of Transcription Factors on Eukaryotic Genomes: A Biophysical Analysis of Sox2 and Oct4

    **Research Question:** How do transcription factors (TFs) Sox2 and Oct4 interact with eukaryotic genomes, and what are the implications of these interactions for our understanding of gene regulation?

    **Methods:** We conducted a rigorous biophysical analysis of single-molecule data from living cells to investigate the mode of interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on eukaryotic genomes.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to previous interpretations, our analysis reveals that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, where the expression of Sox2 increases Oct4's genomic binding, while the expression of Oct4 decreases Sox2's binding. This phenomenon can arise from either energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the interactions between Sox2 and Oct4 are more complex than previously thought, with both positive and negative cooperativity occurring across the genome. This has significant ramifications for our understanding of gene regulation and the interpretation of single-molecule data. The genomic-diversity model, which accounts for the variation in sign of cooperativity across the genome, provides a framework for understanding these complex interactions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the biophysical properties of TFs in understanding their interactions with eukaryotic genomes. The single-molecule methods used in this study provide novel detection capabilities for unraveling the mechanisms of TF interactions, revealing unexpected complexity in how Sox2 and Oct4 interact on DNA. Future studies will need to address the implications of this finding, including the possibility of energy expenditure in the action of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA.

**Title:** Detection of Bacterial Endotoxins via a Gustatory Pathway in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** Do Drosophila melanogaster possess sensory mechanisms to detect bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), prior to infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the aversive responses of Drosophila melanogaster to LPS using feeding and egg-laying assays. We also examined the role of gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors and the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in LPS avoidance.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that Drosophila melanogaster display strong aversive responses to LPS, which is mediated by gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors. We found that the expression of dTRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation, which is a conserved molecular mechanism. This sensory mechanism may serve to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria by allowing flies to avoid LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that Drosophila melanogaster possess a gustatory mechanism to detect bacterial endotoxins, which is mediated by dTRPA1 channels. This finding highlights the importance of TRPA1 in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, suggesting a broadly conserved principle. Our results have implications for understanding the evolution of immune responses and the development of novel strategies to prevent bacterial infections.

    **Title:** Zfp335 is an Essential Transcription Factor Regulating Late-Stage T Cell Maturation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the zinc finger protein Zfp335 in the maturation of naïve T lymphocytes?

    **Methods:** We generated a mouse mutant, bloto, harboring a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335 and analyzed its effects on T cell development in the thymus and periphery.

    **Main Findings:** Zfp335bloto/bloto mice exhibit a naïve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335bloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation, or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Notably, restoring the expression of one target gene, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation.

    **Implications:** Our findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation. The discovery of Zfp335's role in T cell development provides new insights into the mechanisms governing immune function and highlights the importance of transcriptional regulation in T cell maturation.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that Zfp335 is a critical regulator of T cell maturation, and its dysregulation leads to a selective defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells. The identification of Ankle2 as a functional target gene of Zfp335 underscores the importance of transcriptional regulation in T cell development. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of immune function and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related disorders.

    **Title:** mRNA:ncRNA Avoidance: A Novel Global Factor Influencing Protein Abundance in Prokaryotes

    **Research Question:** To what extent do stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions impact protein abundance in prokaryotes, and can these interactions be modulated to control protein expression levels?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to investigate the relationship between mRNA:ncRNA interactions and protein abundance in prokaryotes. We generated synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions and measured their expression levels. We also conducted a meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data to examine the relationship between mRNA and ncRNA avoidance and protein abundance.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions have a significant impact on protein abundance in prokaryotes. We identified a novel global factor, mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, which increases translational efficiency and is strongly selected for across prokaryotes. Furthermore, we found that mRNA:ncRNA avoidance has a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant GFP mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrated that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance. We predict that mRNAs with low avoidance values will produce fewer proteins for each mRNA transcript than those with high avoidance. Our results also indicate that crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs can impact protein expression levels, and that accounting for these interactions will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of mRNA:ncRNA interactions in regulating protein abundance in prokaryotes. We propose that mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is a key factor influencing protein expression levels, and that accounting for these interactions will enable the precise control of protein abundance. Our findings have significant implications for the design of genetic constructs and the understanding of gene expression regulation in prokaryotes.

**Title:** Asynchronous Denervation of Neuromuscular Junctions in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Complex and Dynamic Process

**Background:** Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Despite its early onset, the mechanisms underlying NMJ denervation in ALS remain poorly understood.

**Research Question:** Is NMJ denervation in ALS a manifestation of global motor neuron degeneration or a complex and dynamic process involving local branch-specific events?

**Methods:** We employed in vivo imaging of single axons and their NMJs in SOD1G37R mice over a three-month period to investigate the time course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression.

**Main Findings:** Our results reveal that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37R mice, with weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation, rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration. This temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration could be therapeutically exploited in ALS.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying NMJ denervation in ALS, highlighting the importance of local branch-specific events in the disease progression. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving NMJs and slowing disease progression in ALS patients.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insight into Tamoxifen-Induced Side Effects: A Role for Estrogen Receptor Alpha in the Hypothalamus-Preoptic Area

    **Research Question:** What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the side effects of tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer patients, and what is the role of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in mediating these effects?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing and conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA) of mice to investigate the effects of tamoxifen treatment on gene expression, thermoregulation, bone density, and movement.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that tamoxifen treatment induces widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus-POA, which are dependent on ERα. Conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression changes, and ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the effects of tamoxifen on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement.

    **Implications:** These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. Our results suggest that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. Given the known roles of ERα in mediating many aspects of physiology, these findings have important implications for understanding the side effects of tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer patients.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the utility of mice as a model to study the physiological effects of tamoxifen and highlights the critical role of ERα in mediating these effects. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tamoxifen-induced side effects and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate these effects in breast cancer patients.

    **Title:** ISG15 Restricts Listeria Infection through Interferon-Independent Mechanisms in Nonphagocytic Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the role of ISG15 in restricting Listeria infection in nonphagocytic cells, and how does it contribute to the innate immune response?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of ISG15 in Listeria infection. We employed stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to identify ISGylated proteins responsible for the protective effect of ISG15. We also used a viral protein, B18R, to block signaling from the interferon receptor to determine if ISG15 induction is interferon-independent.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ISG15 expression is dramatically induced in nonphagocytic cells upon Listeria infection, and this induction is independent of type I interferon signaling. We found that Listeria-mediated ISG15 induction depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Importantly, we demonstrate that ISG15 restricts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo. Using SILAC, we identified ISGylated ER and Golgi proteins that correlate with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection, highlighting the importance of ISG15 as a key component of the innate immune response. The identification of ISGylated ER and Golgi proteins suggests a novel mechanism by which ISG15 modulates cytokine secretion to counteract infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that ISG15 plays a critical role in restricting Listeria infection in nonphagocytic cells through interferon-independent mechanisms. The ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins by ISG15 leads to increased secretion of cytokines that counteract infection, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ISG15's anti-viral activity. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the innate immune response and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections.

    **Title:** DeepFRET: An Automated, Open-Source Solution for Objective Analysis of Single-Molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) Data

    **Research Question:** Can a deep learning-based approach be developed to automate the analysis of single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) data, enabling rapid, objective, and accurate quantification of biomolecular dynamics?

    **Methods:** We developed DeepFRET, an open-source, standalone software that utilizes a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) to analyze smFRET data. The software operates with minimal human intervention, requiring only a user-adjustable quality threshold to output detailed quantification of structural dynamics from raw images.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that DeepFRET achieves >95% classification accuracy on ground truth data, outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold methods, while requiring ~1% of the time. The software's precision and speed were further validated on real data, showcasing its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics.

    **Implications:** The development of DeepFRET represents a paradigm shift in smFRET analysis, enabling fully automated methodologies for biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and dynamics. This advance has the potential to increase the breadth and impact of single-molecule studies in structural biology.

    **Conclusions:** DeepFRET offers a rapid, objective, and accurate assessment of smFRET data, making it an invaluable tool for the scientific community. Its open-source nature and user-friendly interface enable end-users with limited programming skills to easily operate the software. The software's ability to recognize abstract patterns and learn useful features directly from raw input data eliminates the need for extensive data preprocessing or empirically defined rules, ensuring reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data. DeepFRET's potential to benchmark the reproducibility of smFRET data acquisition methods across laboratories highlights its significance in advancing the field of dynamic structural biology.

    Title: SCML2A Contributes to Polycomb Repressive Complex-1 (PRC1) Localization and Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression

    Background: Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1) plays a crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, is a Polycomb-group protein that associates with PRC1.

    Research Question: What is the role of SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated with chromatin, in PRC1 localization and epigenetic regulation of gene expression?

    Methods: We used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the function of SCML2A in PRC1 localization and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

    Main Findings: We show that SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that SCML2A plays a crucial role in PRC1 localization and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The identification of SCML2 as a PcG protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets will help shed new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation.

    Conclusions: Our results support a model in which the RBR contributes to the localization of SCML2A to chromatin, where it interacts with PRC1 and creates a chromatin environment that is refractory to transcription. We propose that SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and that, in turn, SCML2A contributes to stabilizing PRC1. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and highlights the importance of ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanism of SecM-Dependent Translational Stalling in Escherichia coli

    **Research Question:** How does the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulate the SecA-dependent secretion pathway in Escherichia coli by stalling ribosomes at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle?

    **Methods:** We employed an in vitro translation system from E. coli to purify SecM-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) and analyzed their structures using single-particle cryo-EM at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution.

    **Main Findings:** Our cryo-EM structures of SecM-stalled ribosomes reveal two distinct stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps of the translation cycle. The first mechanism involves the inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA. The second mechanism involves the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site, which prevents full-scale tRNA translocation. These findings demonstrate that SecM-dependent translational stalling is achieved through a dynamic reshaping of the ribosome's functional center.

    **Implications:** Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling, shedding light on how regulatory peptides control the translation cycle. The identification of two distinct stalling mechanisms highlights the complexity of ribosome regulation and underscores the importance of ribosome- SecM interactions in modulating translation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals the atomic-level details of SecM-dependent translational stalling, providing a framework for understanding how SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway in E. coli. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of ribosome regulation and translation control, and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial translation.
Title: Foveal Cone Density as a Function of Axial Length in Living Eyes: Implications for Visual Acuity in Myopes and Emmetropes

    Abstract:
    We investigated the relationship between foveal cone density and axial length in 28 eyes of 16 subjects using a novel Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope. Our results show that foveal cone density increases with axial length, but not in proportion to eye length. Notably, myopes exhibit a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, despite retinal stretching. This finding contradicts previous reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes, suggesting that increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching is not the primary cause of these deficits. Our study provides new insights into the physical and visual implications of foveal cone density as a function of axial length, with potential implications for understanding visual acuity in myopes and emmetropes.

    Research Question:
    How does foveal cone density vary as a function of axial length in living eyes, and what are the implications for visual acuity in myopes and emmetropes?

    Methods:
    We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that foveal cone density increases with axial length, but not in proportion to eye length. Myopes exhibit a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, despite retinal stretching.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching is not the primary cause of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes. Instead, myopes may have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea, potentially leading to better visual acuity.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the physical and visual implications of foveal cone density as a function of axial length, with potential implications for understanding visual acuity in myopes and emmetropes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the relationship between foveal cone density and visual acuity in myopes and emmetropes.

    **Title:** Quantifying the Genetic Determinants of Streptococcus pneumoniae Carriage Duration in Infants

    **Background:** Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, particularly in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but the variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level.

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic determinants of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage duration in infants?

    **Methods:** We developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated the heritability of pneumococcal genomic variation and partitioned it into lineage and locus effects.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while host traits (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. We further quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other significant locus effects (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism.

    **Implications:** Our findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance. The identification of prophage sequences as a significant factor in carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage, even during carriage episodes.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a quantitative estimate of the genetic determinants of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage duration in infants. Our results suggest that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with recent theoretical work. We have identified candidates for the loci that fulfil this role and provide a framework for understanding the genetic contribution to pneumococcal carriage duration. These findings have important implications for the development of strategies to prevent and control pneumococcal disease, particularly in low-income settings.
Title: Elucidating the Stoichiometry of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 Complex: Implications for Cardiac Repolarization

    Abstract:
    The slow delayed rectifier current (IKs) plays a crucial role in stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration in the heart. The tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel, KCNQ1, and its β-subunit, KCNE1, are key components of this current. However, the stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been a subject of controversy, with studies reporting either a strict 2:4 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. To address this issue, we used IKs fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits to reproduce 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Our whole-cell and single-channel recordings revealed that the 2:4 and 4:4 stoichiometries exhibited increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to the 1:4 stoichiometry. Notably, these effects were abolished by the addition of KCNE1. Furthermore, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found that the crosslinking rates of the 2:4 and 4:4 stoichiometries were progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, indicating that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. These findings suggest that flexibility in KCNQ1’s β-subunits association allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression. Our results have significant implications for understanding the regulation of IKs and its role in cardiac function and disease.

    Research Question:
    What is the stoichiometry of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex, and how does it affect the properties of the slow delayed rectifier current (IKs)?

    Methods:
    We used IKs fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits to reproduce 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings were performed in mammalian cells, and UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approaches were used to study the association of KCNE1 with KCNQ1.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the 2:4 and 4:4 stoichiometries exhibit increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to the 1:4 stoichiometry. These effects were abolished by the addition of KCNE1. Furthermore, the crosslinking rates of the 2:4 and 4:4 stoichiometries were progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, indicating that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that flexibility in KCNQ1’s β-subunits association allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression. This has significant implications for understanding the regulation of IKs and its role in cardiac function and disease.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the stoichiometry of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex and its effects on the properties of IKs. The flexibility in KCNQ1’s β-subunits association allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart, which has significant implications for understanding the regulation of IKs and its role in cardiac function and disease.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Interleukin 1 Beta (Il1b) and Macrophages in Tissue Regeneration: A Double-Edged Sword

    **Research Question:** What is the role of interleukin 1 beta (Il1b) and macrophages in tissue regeneration, particularly in the context of fin fold regeneration in zebrafish?

    **Methods:** This study employed a zebrafish model of fin fold regeneration to investigate the role of Il1b and macrophages in tissue regeneration. The authors used a combination of genetic ablation, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression analysis to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Il1b expression and macrophage function in response to tissue injury.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed that epithelial cells, rather than myeloid cells, are the primary source of Il1b in response to tissue injury. Prolonged expression of Il1b leads to apoptosis of regenerative cells, while macrophages play a crucial role in attenuating Il1b expression and resolving inflammation. Furthermore, the study showed that normal levels of Il1b expression and inflammatory response are necessary for the activation of regeneration-induced genes, which are essential for tissue regeneration.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of tissue regeneration and the role of Il1b and macrophages in this process. The study reveals that Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation act as a double-edged sword: while they are required for regeneration, excessive levels can impair tissue regeneration.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration and highlights the importance of Il1b and macrophages in this process. The findings suggest that a proper balance of Il1b expression and inflammatory response, tuned by macrophages, is necessary for successful tissue regeneration. These results have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for tissue repair and regeneration in humans.

    **Title:** Protein Mobility in Prokaryotic Cytoplasm: The Role of Surface Properties and Ionic Strength

    **Research Question:** How do protein surface properties and ionic strength influence protein mobility in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells, and what are the implications for cellular processes?

    **Methods:** We used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to investigate the translational diffusion coefficients (D) of proteins in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. We analyzed the effects of protein surface charge and ionic strength on protein mobility.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that protein mobility in E. coli depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein surface, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. We also found that the decrease in mobility is primarily caused by the interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes, as confirmed by in vivo diffusion measurements and in vitro experiments with purified ribosomes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ribosome surface properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. The binding of positive proteins to ribosomes may inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the assembly or activity of ribosomes. This has significant implications for our understanding of prokaryotic cell biology, particularly in the context of endosymbiotic relationships.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering protein surface properties and ionic strength in understanding protein mobility in prokaryotic cytoplasm. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of cellular processes, including protein synthesis, and may shed light on the functioning of prokaryotic endosymbionts. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the consequences of our findings and to explore the broader implications for cellular biology.

    **Title:** Identification of Smed-follistatin as a Key Regulator of Regeneration in Planarians

    **Research Question:** How do planarians distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate distinct wound response programs?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including RNA interference (RNAi) and gene expression analysis, to investigate the role of Smed-follistatin in planarian regeneration.

    **Main Findings:** We identified Smed-follistatin, a homolog of the TGF-β inhibitor follistatin, as a critical regulator of regeneration in planarians. Inhibition of Smed-follistatin blocked responses to tissue absence, but did not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs, Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, were found to be required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. Furthermore, Smed-follistatin was wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence. This mechanism is critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in planarians. The identification of Smed-follistatin as a key regulator of regeneration highlights the importance of TGF-β signaling in this process. The wound-induced expression of Smed-follistatin and its role in inhibiting Smed-Activin proteins provide a mechanistic explanation for how planarians distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate distinct wound response programs. These findings have broad implications for understanding core regenerative mechanisms and may inform the development of regenerative therapies in humans.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Fingerprint of Mismatch Repair-Deficient Tumors through Whole-Genome and Whole-Exome Sequencing

    Abstract:
    Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors exhibit a distinct molecular fingerprint characterized by persistent DNA replication errors, which confer resistance to standard therapy. We employed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to investigate the mutation spectra in MMR-deficient tumors and their clinical relevance. Our results reveal a unique mutation signature in MMR-deficient tumors, surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises from mutations escaping MMR. Furthermore, we identified a large set of recurrent indels that may serve as markers for microsatellite instability (MSI). Using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimized a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Notably, recurrent indels are enriched for the DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination pathway, leading to reduced DSB repair in MMR-deficient tumors. Consequently, MMR-deficient tumor cultures exhibit a dose-dependent sensitivity to DSB inducers. Our findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of MMR-deficient tumors, highlighting the potential of recurrent indels as biomarkers for MSI and the therapeutic vulnerability of MMR-deficient tumors to DSB inducers.

    Research Question:
    What is the molecular fingerprint of MMR-deficient tumors, and how can it be used to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors?

    Methods:
    We employed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to investigate the mutation spectra in MMR-deficient tumors and their clinical relevance. We analyzed 5 and 28 tumor-normal pairs, of which 3 and 22 were MMR-deficient, respectively.

    Main Findings:
    Our results reveal a unique mutation signature in MMR-deficient tumors, surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises from mutations escaping MMR. We identified a large set of recurrent indels that may serve as markers for MSI and optimized a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Recurrent indels are enriched for the DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination pathway, leading to reduced DSB repair in MMR-deficient tumors.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of MMR-deficient tumors. The identification of recurrent indels as biomarkers for MSI may improve the detection of MMR-deficient tumors, while the reduced DSB repair in MMR-deficient tumors highlights their therapeutic vulnerability to DSB inducers.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular fingerprint of MMR-deficient tumors and highlights the potential of recurrent indels as biomarkers for MSI and the therapeutic vulnerability of MMR-deficient tumors to DSB inducers. These findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of MMR-deficient tumors and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these tumors.

    Title: Enhanced Magnets: Overcoming Limitations of Light-Inducible Dimerization Protein Modules for Precise Temporal and Spatial Control of Biological Processes

    Background: Light-inducible dimerization protein modules, such as Magnets, have revolutionized the field of optogenetics by enabling precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive fashion. However, these modules have limitations, including the requirement for concatemerization and low-temperature preincubation for efficient responses.

    Research Question: Can we engineer an optimized Magnets pair that requires neither concatemerization nor low-temperature preincubation for efficient responses?

    Methods: We employed a robust screen for reconstitution of Magnets dimerization using light-dependent accumulation of a protein at the outer mitochondrial membrane. We then optimized the placement of charge-complementing amino acids in the Vivid dimer interface using the crystal structure of the light-activated dimer as a guide.

    Main Findings: We engineered an optimized Magnets pair, termed ‘enhanced Magnets’ (eMags), which exhibits greater thermal stability and dimerization efficiency, as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics compared to the original Magnets pair. eMags can be used to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organelle contacts, and reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism.

    Implications: eMags represent a highly effective tool for optogenetically manipulating physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes, offering major advantages over other systems in several different assays. Their rapid association and dissociation kinetics, combined with low background activation, make them well-suited for optogenetic modulation of small volumes and sub-cellular organelles.

    Conclusions: We have overcome the limitations of Magnets by engineering an optimized pair that requires neither concatemerization nor low-temperature preincubation for efficient responses. eMags are a valuable addition to the toolbox of optogenetic reagents, enabling precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive fashion.

    **Title:** Ribosome Stalling Activates the Integrated Stress Response to Attenuate Neurodegeneration in Mammalian Neurons

    **Research Question:** What are the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons, and how do they contribute to neurodegeneration?

    **Methods:** We used C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. We analyzed the brain of these mice to investigate the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes.

    **Main Findings:** We detected increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) prior to neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Furthermore, we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress. We show that ribosome stalling activates GCN2, a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation. Activation of GCN2 results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, leading to attenuation of neurodegeneration.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel feedback loop between elongation defects, particularly ribosome stalling, and translation initiation. The eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is vital for survival of neurons during ribosome stalling, and its activation attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases.

    **Title:** Global Variations in Adult Height Over the Past Century: A Meta-Analysis of 18.6 Million Participants

    **Research Question:** How has adult height changed over the past century across different countries and populations?

    **Methods:** We conducted a meta-analysis of 1472 population-based studies, involving over 18.6 million participants, to estimate mean height for individuals born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed substantial and uneven changes in adult height across countries over the past century. The largest gains in adult height were observed in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% CI: 17.5-22.7) and 16.5 cm (95% CI: 13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and South Asia. The tallest populations over the past century were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, with an average height of 182.5 cm, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896, with an average height of 140.3 cm (95% CI: 135.8-144.8).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the height differential between the tallest and shortest populations has remained relatively stable over the past century, with a gap of approximately 19-20 cm for women and 22-23 cm for men. However, the ranking of countries in terms of adult height has changed substantially, with some countries experiencing significant increases in height while others have seen little change.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive overview of global variations in adult height over the past century. Our results highlight the importance of considering the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and socio-economic factors that influence human growth and development.

    **Title:** Identification of Brainstem Neurons Mediating Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression

    **Research Question:** What are the key brain areas and cell types responsible for mediating opioid-induced respiratory depression, a major contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States?

    **Methods:** Using a murine model, we investigated the effects of opioid administration on breathing patterns and identified the brainstem's breathing circuitry as a critical site of action. We employed genetic tools to selectively eliminate the µ-Opioid receptor in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), the brain region responsible for generating the breathing rhythm.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that just 70-140 glutamatergic neurons in the preBötC are sufficient to mediate opioid-induced respiratory depression. Notably, these neurons are not required for opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting a potential target for developing safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose. Furthermore, we found that deleting the µ-Opioid receptor from both the preBötC and an alternative site eliminates opioid-induced respiratory depression, even at high doses of the potent opioid fentanyl.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapies to prevent respiratory depression while preserving analgesia. By targeting these specific neurons, it may be possible to create safer opioids or rescue strategies for individuals at risk of opioid overdose.

    **Conclusions:** Our study identifies the preBötC as a critical site of action for opioid-induced respiratory depression and highlights the importance of glutamatergic neurons in mediating this effect. The discovery of a small subset of neurons responsible for opioid-induced respiratory depression provides a promising target for future therapeutic interventions. Further characterization of these neurons may lead to the development of novel treatments that mitigate the risks associated with opioid use while preserving their analgesic benefits.
Title: Identification of Sodium Taurocholate Cotransporting Polypeptide (NTCP) as a Functional Receptor for Human Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis D Virus (HDV)

    Abstract:

    Background: Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HBV-related diseases remain a significant public health concern. Coinfection with the satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) exacerbates disease severity. The cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, with the pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein being a key determinant for receptor binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) remains unknown.

    Methods: We employed near-zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification to identify the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the HBV envelope protein. We used a synthetic modified peptide originating from the native aa 2–48 lipopeptide (Myr-47/WT) as a probe and a series of biochemical approaches and virological assays to confirm the interaction between sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and the L proteins of HBV and HDV.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that NTCP, a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver, interacts specifically with the L proteins of HBV and HDV and functions as a common receptor for both viruses. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability to support both viral infections.

    Implications: Our findings provide conclusive evidence that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the entry of these viruses into hepatocytes. This discovery has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against HBV and HDV infections.

    Conclusions: The identification of NTCP as a functional receptor for HBV and HDV represents a major breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these viral infections. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential of NTCP as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HBV and HDV infections.

    **Title:** Sepsis-Induced Changes in Memory CD8 T Cells: Long-Term Alterations in Phenotype, Function, and Localization

    **Research Question:** What are the long-term effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells, and how do these changes impact the host's ability to respond to re-infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells in both patients and mice using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. We analyzed the proliferation, composition, and function of memory CD8 T cells in septic patients and mice, as well as their ability to control Listeria monocytogenes infection.

    **Main Findings:** We observed that central memory CD8 T cells (TCM) from septic patients and mice proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. This increased proliferation leads to changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. Furthermore, memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating long-lasting T cell intrinsic changes. These changes result in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control L. monocytogenes infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function, and localization, potentially changing the host's capacity to respond to re-infection. These changes may predispose individuals to re-infection and compromise their ability to mount an effective immune response.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the long-term effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells and highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying these changes. Understanding the impact of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve immune function and reduce the risk of re-infection in sepsis survivors.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of APOBEC3A-Mediated Inhibition of Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) Retrotransposition

    Abstract:
    Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a significant mutagenic threat to human genomes. To counteract this threat, human cells have evolved strategies to regulate L1 retrotransposition, including the APOBEC3 (A3) gene family. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A (A3A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Here, we employed in vitro and in vivo assays to elucidate the mechanism of A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition. Our results demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. Furthermore, we show that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells co-expressing A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (UGI) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.

    Research Question: What is the molecular mechanism by which APOBEC3A (A3A) inhibits Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposition?

    Methods: We employed in vitro and in vivo assays, including the L1 Element Amplification Protocol (LEAP), to investigate the mechanism of A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. We also show that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells co-expressing A3A and UGI contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events.

    Implications: These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition, shedding light on the molecular mechanism of A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition and highlight the importance of A3A in regulating L1 retrotransposition in human cells.

    **Title:** Rem2 Regulates Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the Visual Cortex

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity using Rem2 knockout (Rem2-/-) mice. We examined ocular dominance (OD) plasticity during the critical period and in adulthood, as well as the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vitro and in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal OD plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, we found that Rem2 regulates intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. These findings indicate that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in response to changing sensory experience.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity, preserving proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. These results raise the possibility that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function. Given that Rem2 expression is acutely regulated by visual experience, we propose that Rem2 plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation. Further investigation of Rem2-dependent signaling mechanisms will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neural circuitry. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of Rem2 in regulating experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex.

    **Title:** Magnetic Fields and Biological Molecules: A Critical Reevaluation of Magnetogenetics and Magnetosensation

    **Research Question:** Can magnetic fields be used to control biological molecules and cells, as proposed by recent studies on magnetogenetics and magnetosensation?

    **Methods:** A critical analysis of existing literature on magnetogenetics and magnetosensation, focusing on the biophysical mechanisms proposed by Qin et al. (2016), Stanley et al. (2015), and Wheeler et al. (2016).

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between the reported effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells and the basic laws of physics. Specifically, the forces, torques, and temperatures produced by paramagnetic protein complexes are too small by many orders of magnitude to achieve the desired effects on molecular orientation or membrane channels.

    **Implications:** If the reported phenomena do occur, they must rely on entirely different mechanisms than those proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes severely limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. Furthermore, the proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, have no chance of success without dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter.

    **Conclusions:** Our reevaluation of magnetogenetics and magnetosensation highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying these phenomena. While the idea of controlling biological molecules and cells with magnetic fields is intriguing, the current evidence does not support the proposed mechanisms. Future research should focus on exploring alternative explanations for magnetosensation and magnetogenetics, such as the interaction of magnetic fields with single molecules in biochemical reactions (Ritz et al., 2010). Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the biophysical basis for magnetosensation and magnetogenetics is essential for the development of novel therapeutic and technological applications.

    **Title:** Prospero Regulates Quiescence in Drosophila Neural Progenitors

    **Research Question:** How do Drosophila neural progenitors (neuroblasts) switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence, and what is the role of the differentiation factor Prospero in this process?

    **Methods:** We used Drosophila neuroblasts as a model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying quiescence. We analyzed the expression of Prospero, a known differentiation factor, in relation to neuroblast quiescence and proliferation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Prospero is transiently detected at low levels in the neuroblast nucleus just prior to entry into quiescence. We found that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. Furthermore, we observed that nearly all quiescent neuroblasts reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers after 24 hours. We also found that precocious low-level nuclear Prospero can advance the timing of neuroblast quiescence.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying quiescence in Drosophila neural progenitors and highlights the importance of Prospero in regulating this process.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that transient, low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence and that Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence. We propose that the pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero marks neuroblast entry into quiescence, suggesting a functional relationship between Prospero and quiescence. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of stem cell biology and the development of stem cell-based therapeutics.

    Title: Dissecting the Uncoating Kinetics of HIV-1 Capsids: A Single-Particle Fluorescence Microscopy Study

    Background: The uncoating of the HIV-1 capsid is a critical step in the viral life cycle, allowing for the release of the viral cDNA prior to nuclear import. However, the intrinsic disassembly pathway of the capsid and its regulation by capsid-binding molecules remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What are the discrete steps involved in the uncoating of HIV-1 capsids, and how do capsid-binding molecules modulate this process?

    Methods: We developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method to follow the real-time uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids in vitro immediately after permeabilizing the viral membrane. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of capsid-binding molecules on discrete steps in the capsid uncoating process.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, followed by rapid and catastrophic collapse. The capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates capsid opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice strongly delays initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently, and the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators likely determines the overall uncoating kinetics. This has important implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting the HIV-1 capsid.

    Conclusions: Our single-particle fluorescence microscopy study provides new insights into the uncoating kinetics of HIV-1 capsids and the effects of capsid-binding molecules on this process. By resolving intermediates in the disassembly pathway that are otherwise averaged out in traditional ensemble assays, our approach has allowed us to classify HIV-1 capsids according to their uncoating behaviors. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the HIV-1 life cycle and the development of novel antiviral strategies.

    **Title:** Unexpected Role of JNK Signaling in Breast Cancer Development: Loss-of-Function Mutations Promote Tumor Initiation

    **Research Question:** Do loss-of-function mutations in the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway contribute to breast cancer development?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium using a mouse model of breast cancer. We examined the impact of JNK signaling on genomic stability, tumor initiation, and progression.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found that loss of JNK signaling in mammary epithelial cells led to the development of breast cancer in mice. Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer, associated with widespread early neoplasia and genomic instability. Our data indicate that JNK plays a crucial role in preventing tumor initiation, rather than promoting tumor growth.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway may be "driver" mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation in breast cancer. The frequent occurrence of JNK pathway loss-of-function mutations in human breast cancer may contribute to the development of this malignancy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals an unexpected role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development. We demonstrate that JNK deficiency promotes murine breast cancer development and accelerates tumor formation in a mouse model of breast cancer. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer and highlight the importance of JNK signaling in preventing tumor initiation. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of JNK pathway mutations in breast cancer and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Peptidylglycine α-Amidating Monooxygenase (PAM) in Cilium Biogenesis across Eukaryotic Cell Types

    Abstract:
    Cilium biogenesis, the process by which cilia form and mature, remains poorly understood in various cell types. Recent studies have implicated peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme involved in generating amidated bioactive signaling peptides, in the assembly of cilia in Chlamydomonas and mammalian cells. Here, we investigate the role of PAM in ciliogenesis across multiple eukaryotic cell types, including Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice. Our results demonstrate that PAM is essential for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in these organisms. Knockdown of PAM in Chlamydomonas resulted in cilia assembly defects beyond the transition zone, abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Similarly, decreased PAM gene expression in planaria reduced motile ciliary density and led to the formation of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. In mice, PAM deficiency resulted in aberrant primary cilia architecture on neuroepithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PAM activity and post-Golgi trafficking contribute to ciliogenesis defects and reveal a highly conserved link between PAM, amidation, and ciliary assembly across eukaryotic cell types. These results highlight the importance of PAM in ciliogenesis and provide new insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying cilium biogenesis.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) in ciliogenesis across multiple eukaryotic cell types?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of molecular biology, cell biology, and microscopy techniques to investigate the role of PAM in ciliogenesis in Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that PAM is essential for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice. PAM knockdown or deficiency resulted in cilia assembly defects, abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia assembly components.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that PAM activity and post-Golgi trafficking contribute to ciliogenesis defects and reveal a highly conserved link between PAM, amidation, and ciliary assembly across eukaryotic cell types. These results highlight the importance of PAM in ciliogenesis and provide new insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying cilium biogenesis.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates that PAM is a crucial, evolutionarily conserved factor required for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types. The conserved role of PAM in ciliogenesis across eukaryotic cell types suggests that PAM may have a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Myo3-Mediated Cross-Linking of Espin1 in Stereocilia Development and Maintenance

    **Research Question:** How does the Class III myosin Myo3 interact with the actin-bundling protein Espin1 to regulate the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays to elucidate the molecular basis of the Myo3-Espin1 interaction and its role in actin bundle assembly and stabilization.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that the tail homology I motif (THDI) of Myo3 contains two repeat sequences capable of independently binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1 with high affinity. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 reveal a Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism that promotes actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. Furthermore, we found that Myo3 binding can release the auto-inhibition of Espin1, leading to an increase in the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. The Myo3-Espin1 interaction is crucial for promoting the formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. Defects in this interaction have been linked to hereditary hearing impairments.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein. The Myo3-Espin1 interaction is essential for the proper development and maintenance of stereocilia, and its dysregulation can lead to hearing impairments. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular basis of hearing loss and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating hearing-related disorders.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Voltage Sensing in Eukaryotic Calcium Channels: A Structural and Functional Analysis of CaV1.1 Voltage-Sensing Domains

    Abstract:
    Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs) are essential for various cellular functions, including synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, and hormone secretion. To understand the molecular mechanisms governing their voltage-sensing properties, we employed a multidisciplinary approach combining structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1. Our results reveal that both VSDs exhibit the characteristic features of the sliding helix model, but differ significantly in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Specifically, stabilization of the activated state enhances the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slows the kinetics. These findings provide a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

    Research Question:
    What are the molecular mechanisms governing the specific voltage-sensing properties of eukaryotic calcium channels?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct VSDs of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that both VSDs exhibit the characteristic features of the sliding helix model, but differ significantly in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhances the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slows the kinetics.

    Implications:
    These findings provide a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels. This understanding has important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting voltage-gated calcium channels in various diseases, including cardiovascular and neurological disorders.

    Conclusions:
    Our study fills an important gap in the understanding of the voltage-sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The structural and functional analysis of CaV1.1 VSDs provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the specific voltage-sensing properties of these channels, and highlights the importance of ion-pair formation in determining the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

    **Title:** The Role of Matrix Metalloproteinases in Adult Visual Plasticity: A Critical Window for Recovery

    **Research Question:** Do matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in adult visual plasticity, and can inhibition of their upregulation following cortical stroke rescue lost plasticity?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice using a combination of in vivo optical imaging and behavioral vision tests.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals. However, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once, but not twice, following stroke rescued plasticity, which is normally lost under these conditions. These findings suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is essential for adult visual plasticity to occur.

    **Implications:** Our data highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after a cortical lesion compromises experience-induced visual plasticity, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. This implies that precise regulation of MMP-activity is essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, particularly for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after monocular deprivation (MD). These findings expand previous studies from juvenile rats and suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. The results also provide new opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke, as a single treatment with MMP-inhibitor after the stroke rescued plasticity in both paradigms. Overall, our study highlights the importance of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and the need for precise regulation of their activity to facilitate recovery after brain injury.

    **Title:** Conformational Dynamics of AMPA Receptors at Vertebrate Excitatory Synapses

    **Research Question:** What are the conformational dynamics of AMPA receptors at vertebrate excitatory synapses, particularly in the presence and absence of auxiliary subunits?

    **Methods:** We employed bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of AMPA receptors in complex with auxiliary subunits were also analyzed.

    **Main Findings:** Our data indicate that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can get trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. However, the presence of Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. In contrast, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, the extracellular domains of AMPA receptors likely remain compact during gating.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that the extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and instead work in a fairly compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the conformational dynamics of AMPA receptors at vertebrate excitatory synapses. The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargazin, plays a crucial role in regulating the conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors. These findings have important implications for our understanding of synaptic transmission and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders associated with AMPA receptor dysfunction.

    **Significance:** This study contributes to the growing body of research on the structural biology of AMPA receptors and highlights the importance of auxiliary subunits in regulating their conformational dynamics. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of synaptic transmission and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders associated with AMPA receptor dysfunction.

    **Title:** Systematic Optimization of Intestinal Digestion Protocol for Single-Cell Isolation from Helminth-Infected Murine Intestines

    **Research Question:** Can a standardized intestinal digestion protocol be optimized to facilitate the isolation of millions of immune cells from heavily infected murine duodena, and does this protocol provide an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses during helminth infection?

    **Methods:** We employed a systematic optimization of a standard intestinal digestion protocol to isolate immune cells from the duodena of mice infected with helminths. The isolated cells were then analyzed using a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel and validated by confocal microscopy.

    **Main Findings:** Our optimized protocol enabled the isolation of millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodena. High-dimensional spectral flow cytometry analysis revealed many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection, including changes in B220+, Siglec F+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD4-, and CD64+ cell populations. These findings were corroborated by confocal microscopy, demonstrating that our protocol provides an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses.

    **Implications:** Our optimized cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis have the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses, which have previously been unfeasible due to the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration in the intestines.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of isolating millions of immune cells from heavily infected murine intestines using a systematically optimized intestinal digestion protocol. The accuracy of our protocol was validated by high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry analysis and confocal microscopy, enabling the characterization of many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. Our findings highlight the importance of good cell isolation techniques for investigating intestinal responses against helminths directly, and our protocol has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries in this field.

    **Title:** Elucidating Proteasomal Peptide-Hydrolysis Dynamics: An Integrated Experimental and Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity, and how do they impact protein half-life and cellular processes?

    **Methods:** We employed an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modeling approach to develop, explore, and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. We used carefully designed experimental assays and detailed modeling to shed light on the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time for representative peptides.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes, thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage. We also found that the 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme, and its activity varies over time due to interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites. Our model predicts the locations of these sites and the interactions between them, which are experimentally supported.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of proteasome function and its role in regulating protein half-life and cellular processes. The model developed in this study provides a comprehensive framework for describing the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of proteasomal action, particularly the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity and highlights the importance of considering the structural characteristics of the proteasome in understanding its catalytic activity. The model developed in this study can be used to predict proteasome dynamics in more complex scenarios, such as those that exist inside the cellular environment. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of proteasome function and its role in regulating protein half-life and cellular processes.
Title: Identification of a Novel β-Alanine Transporter Required for Histamine Homeostasis and Visual Synaptic Transmission in Drosophila

    Abstract:

    Background: The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission, and histamine recycling is critical for visual synaptic transmission in Drosophila. However, the mechanisms underlying β-alanine recycling, a key component of histamine homeostasis, remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: Do retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission, and is a β-alanine transporter required for histamine homeostasis and visual synaptic transmission in Drosophila?

    Methods: We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to identify a novel β-alanine transporter, BalaT, in Drosophila. We generated balat mutants and analyzed their effects on β-alanine levels, β-alanine accumulation in the retina, and visual synaptic transmission.

    Main Findings: We found that balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine and reduced β-alanine accumulation in the retina. Moreover, BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior.

    Implications: Our results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual synaptic transmission.

    Conclusions: We identified a novel β-alanine transporter, BalaT, which is essential for histamine homeostasis and visual synaptic transmission in Drosophila. Our findings highlight the importance of β-alanine recycling in maintaining histamine levels and suggest a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying histamine recycling and visual synaptic transmission, and has implications for our understanding of neurotransmitter homeostasis in the nervous system.

    **Title:** Redox Collapse in Chronologically Aging Yeast Cells: A Novel Insight into the Mechanisms of Aging

    **Research Question:** What are the precise roles of oxidants in lifespan and aging, and how do chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse?

    **Methods:** We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate the onset, extent, and targets of protein oxidation in postmitotic aging cells. We monitored the thiol oxidation status of almost 300 different protein thiols and discovered that yeast cells undergo a global redox collapse, leading to massive thiol oxidation in almost 80% of identified proteins several days prior to cell death.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, which is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but rather by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH levels. This decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that down-regulates most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that chronological aging might represent a physiological stress condition that utilizes and stresses the redox buffering capacity of the thiol proteome. The observed decrease in cellular NADPH levels and the concomitant increase in cellular redox potential might be shared with other aging organisms as their metabolism changes.

    **Conclusions:** This study reveals a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of aging and suggest that the redox collapse in chronologically aging yeast cells is a critical event in the aging process. Further studies are needed to uncover protein targets whose oxidative thiol modifications might contribute to the physiological alterations observed in aging organisms and to establish a clear correlation between onset and extent of oxidative stress and lifespan.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Basis of D-Aminoacyl-tRNA Deacylase Reveals a Chiral Enforcement Mechanism for Homochirality in Proteins

    **Research Question:** How does the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) selectively remove D-amino acids from tRNAs, ensuring the homochirality of the biological macromolecular world?

    **Methods:** We solved the crystal structure of the dimeric DTD from Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog, providing insights into the mechanistic basis of its configuration-specific activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our structural analysis reveals that DTD uses an invariant Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA, enabling the enzyme to selectively recognize and remove D-amino acids from tRNAs. Notably, this side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition allows DTD to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity of DTD ensures that the cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs is enriched, preventing the incorporation of D-amino acids into proteins.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the enantioselective mechanism involved in the enforcement of homochirality in proteins. The unique recognition mechanism of DTD highlights the crucial role of weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection, providing a basis for how nature has designed a single deacylase to deal with any D-aminoacyl-tRNA.

    **Conclusions:** This study elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a critical role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of the translational apparatus. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of homochirality in proteins and have implications for understanding the mechanisms of protein synthesis and the origins of life. The discovery of the Gly-cisPro dipeptide as a key component of the DTD recognition mechanism highlights the importance of cross-subunit interactions in protein function and provides a new perspective on the evolution of protein structure and function.
Title: Energetic Coupling and Spontaneous Gating in Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Channels

    Abstract:

    Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a chloride channel. The CFTR channel is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily and is regulated by cytosolic ATP. In wild-type CFTR, ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) opens the pore, while dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. However, in certain CF mutants, spontaneous openings without ATP are rare, but can be stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator.

    Research Question: What are the molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating in CFTR channels, and how do they relate to NBD dimerization and ATP binding?

    Methods: We used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface and spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels.

    Main Findings: Our results show that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains the correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of CFTR channel gating and the role of NBD dimerization in spontaneous openings. This understanding has important implications for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating CF.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals that the molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating in CFTR channels are closely linked to NBD dimerization, and that ATP acts as a "molecular glue" to stabilize the transition state and the open state. These findings provide a new framework for understanding the complex interplay between ATP binding, NBD dimerization, and pore opening in CFTR channels, and have important implications for the development of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.
Title: Unveiling the Orderphobic Effect: A Novel Mechanism for Transmembrane Protein Assembly and Mobility in Lipid Bilayers

    Abstract:

    Background: Transmembrane proteins play a crucial role in various cellular processes, yet their assembly and mobility within lipid bilayers remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a novel mechanism, termed the orderphobic effect, which governs the assembly and mobility of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers.

    Research Question: What is the underlying mechanism driving the assembly and mobility of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, and how does it relate to the phase transition between ordered and disordered phases?

    Methods: We employed large-scale molecular simulations to investigate the behavior of transmembrane proteins in model lipid bilayers. Our simulations revealed that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface, which exhibits finite stiffness.

    Main Findings: We discovered that when two such proteins approach each other, they assemble due to the reduction in net interfacial energy. This phenomenon, analogous to the hydrophobic effect, is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the orderphobic effect plays a crucial role in the assembly and mobility of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This novel mechanism has significant implications for our understanding of cellular processes, such as protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and membrane fluidity.

    Conclusions: The orderphobic effect provides a new paradigm for understanding the behavior of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. Our predictions of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be experimentally tested using single molecule tracking techniques. Furthermore, the dual nature of the orderphobic effect, where a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order-disorder interface, highlights the complexity of biological membranes and transmembrane proteins.

    **Title:** Characterizing the Action Potential-Fluorescence Transfer Function in Vivo: Implications for Calcium Imaging Studies

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between action potentials (APs) and fluorescence signals in vivo, and how does this relationship impact the detection of APs in population imaging studies?

    **Methods:** We used simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f to investigate the AP-fluorescence transfer function in 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex.

    **Main Findings:** Under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected (often <10% and ~20-30%, respectively). This emphasizes the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the challenges of inferring underlying AP trains or firing rates from calcium imaging data, particularly in population imaging studies. The large field of view required for population imaging generates fewer photons per neuron, compromising AP detection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals, which will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets. By characterizing the AP-fluorescence transfer function, we can better understand the limitations of calcium imaging and develop more accurate spike inference models. Our results will facilitate the interpretation of datasets from mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset.

    **Future Directions:** Our work has implications for the development of more accurate spike inference models and the design of future calcium imaging experiments. By understanding the AP-fluorescence transfer function, researchers can optimize imaging conditions and improve the detection of APs in population imaging studies, ultimately enhancing our understanding of neural dynamics in vivo.

    **Title:** Functional Switching Valve in the Female Genitalia of Neotrogla: A Novel Mechanism for Seminal Gift Competition

    **Research Question:** How does the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla enable females to compete for seminal gifts in nutrient-poor cave habitats?

    **Methods:** We conducted a morphological and functional analysis of the female genitalia of Neotrogla, focusing on the switching valve complex and its role in seminal flow control.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of Neotrogla, composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. This valve complex enables females to control the direction of seminal flow, allowing them to receive two seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time span. The switching valve also enables females to selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other slot empty, and immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males.

    **Implications:** The presence of a switching valve in Neotrogla's female genitalia is a morphological novelty that enables females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. This mechanism may have evolved as a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of sex-role reversal in the genus Neotrogla, where females have evolved to compete for males to receive nutritious seminal substances. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow further refines our understanding of the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. The switching valve in Neotrogla's female genitalia is a remarkable adaptation that highlights the complexity and diversity of reproductive strategies in insects.

    Title: Munc18-1 Regulates Stage-Wise SNARE Assembly for Rapid Exocytosis of Neurotransmitters

    Research Question: How do SNARE proteins couple their stage-wise folding/assembly to rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters in a Munc18-1-dependent manner?

    Methods: Using optical tweezers, the authors observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). They found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly and exocytosis.

    Main Findings: The authors discovered that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures t-SNARE C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD.

    Implications: The study reveals distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1. The findings suggest that Munc18-1 plays a crucial role in regulating every stage of SNARE assembly, from initiation to stabilization of the half-zippered SNARE complex.

    Conclusions: The authors propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion. They conclude that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters and highlights the importance of Munc18-1 in regulating SNARE assembly and membrane fusion.

    Supporting Text: The authors used optical tweezers to observe the forces associated with Munc18-1-mediated de novo SNARE assembly. They found that Munc18-1 enhances de novo SNARE assembly by holding the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as t-SNARE unfolded. The study also reveals three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex.

    **Title:** Rapid and Modular Self-Assembly of Cell-Matrix Adhesion Sites through Pre-Assembled Integrin Adhesome Building Blocks

    **Research Question:** How do integrin adhesomes self-assemble locally, rapidly, and correctly into diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites?

    **Methods:** We employed fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to investigate the cytosolic state of integrin-adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. These building blocks are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions, indicating symmetric exchange with the cytosol without altering their composition. The building blocks are size-confined and predominantly correspond to functional layers across focal adhesions, including anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol, enabling rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites. Symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol ensures that building blocks enter and exit adhesion sites without being altered, preserving the assembly logic of the system.

    **Conclusions:** We propose a model in which multi-protein building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites. The integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks, which are then locally switched on to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions. This model ensures that the self-assembly process maintains control over the identity of co-recruited proteins, preventing the formation of aberrant structures. Our results provide new insights into the assembly logic of adhesion sites and highlight the importance of integrating interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome to understand this complex biological process.

    **Title:** Electrophysiological Markers of Reduced Arousal States: A Comparative Analysis of Wakefulness, Sleep, and Anesthesia

    **Research Question:** Can the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum be used as a common electrophysiological marker to track states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages and anesthesia in humans?

    **Methods:** This study employed intracranial and surface EEG recordings from four independent data sets to investigate the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum in wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal: NREM sleep, REM sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol. Specifically, the spectral slope becomes more negative (i.e., the power spectrum steeper) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. Moreover, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state.

    **Implications:** These findings provide empirical evidence for the notion that the 1/f dynamics of the electrophysiological power spectrum can be used as a common electrophysiological marker to track states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages and anesthesia in humans. This discovery has significant implications for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for sleep disorders and anesthesia-related complications.

    **Conclusions:** Our results from four independent studies provide a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations, and demonstrate that the non-oscillatory, aperiodic part of the power spectrum can be used to track changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and on a wide range of timescales. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of the 1/f spectral slope as a universal electrophysiological marker for reduced arousal states.

    **Title:** Cytoskeletal Regulation of Stromule Dynamics and Perinuclear Chloroplast Clustering during Innate Immunity

    **Research Question:** How do microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) regulate stromule dynamics and perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity in plant cells?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of MTs and AFs in stromule extension and movement in chloroplasts of green leaf tissue and perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity using a combination of biochemical and microscopic techniques.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that MTs are essential for stromule extension and movement, while AFs provide anchor points for stromules. MT stabilization increases stromule numbers and length, whereas MT depolymerization leads to stromule retraction. We also observed a strong correlation between the direction of stromules from chloroplasts and the direction of chloroplast movement, suggesting a general function of stromules in epidermal cells. Furthermore, we found that MTs and AFs facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an innate immune response.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how interactions with the cytoskeleton form and stabilize stromules, and reveal a new type of organellar movement along MTs that is stromule-directed. We propose a model in which stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding nuclei, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to nuclei during innate immunity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of MTs and AFs in regulating stromule dynamics and perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant innate immunity and the role of stromules in plant cell biology. Future studies should investigate the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and stromule-directed movement, as well as the importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity.

    **Title:** Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions across Interfaces using Residue Covariation

    **Research Question:** Do amino acid sequence identities of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution, and can such covariance be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes?

    **Methods:** We employed a pseudo-likelihood-based statistical method to examine residue-residue covariation across protein-protein interfaces in 50S ribosomal units and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure. We also applied this method to predict contacts across interfaces for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that residue pairs identified using the pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein-protein interfaces are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. Furthermore, we found that significant residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs. This suggests that residue covariation can be a useful predictor of protein-protein interactions.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the assembly of models of biological complexes. By identifying covarying residue pairs, we can make accurate predictions of contacts across interfaces, which can contribute to the determination of the structures of biologically important complexes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that residue covariation can be a powerful tool for predicting protein-protein interactions and assembling models of biological complexes. The pseudo-likelihood-based method used in this study can be applied to a wide range of protein complexes, and our results suggest that it can be used to make accurate predictions of contacts across interfaces. The predicted residue-residue interactions for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure presented in this study provide a valuable resource for structural biologists and can contribute to the determination of the structures of these biologically important complexes.

    **Title:** Active Sensing in Visual Categorization: Unveiling the Efficiency of Eye Movements

    **Research Question:** How do participants accumulate information from multiple locations in a scene to categorize visual patterns, and what is the efficiency of their eye movements in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a visual categorization task, where participants' eye movements were tracked and small apertures of the image were successively revealed at each fixation location. We used a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and an active sensor algorithm to estimate the efficiency of eye movements.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that participants' scan paths follow an active sensing strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. Categorization performance was significantly improved when locations were revealed to participants by an optimal Bayesian active sensor algorithm. We estimated that a major portion of the apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. Our analysis revealed that the central process of selecting fixation locations is around 70% efficient in our task.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations. This active sensing strategy is more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employ a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under active eye movements, allowing us to dissociate the contributions of the eye-movement selection process from those of perceptual, motor, and decision processes. Our results have implications for understanding the efficiency of eye movements in various perceptual domains and highlight the importance of considering the interplay between prior biases, perceptual noise, and eye movement inaccuracies in active sensing tasks.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Determinants of Large Cargo Import through the Nuclear Pore Complex

    Abstract:
    The nuclear pore complex (NPC) plays a crucial role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport, allowing for the passage of thousands of molecules, including large cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes. However, the quantitative understanding of the requirements for nuclear import of these large cargoes, particularly the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and the effect of size on import efficiency, remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nm, with tunable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. We show that the import flux scales non-linearly with size and that the number of NLSs has a significant impact on import efficiency. Our findings provide key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells and have implications for understanding the export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes.

    Methods:
    We used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the nuclear import kinetics of large cargo models. We designed and synthesized four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nm, with tunable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We then assayed the nuclear import kinetics of these cargoes in HeLa cells using live-cell imaging and fluorescence microscopy.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. We found that the import flux scales non-linearly with size and that the number of NLSs has a significant impact on import efficiency.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells and have implications for understanding the export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes. The theoretical model used in this study assumes that the capsids do not interact with each other during transport through the pore, which may not be the case in vivo. However, our results suggest that the basic principles of our work could help in the future to better understand export of large cargoes.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides a quantitative understanding of the requirements for nuclear import of large cargoes and highlights the importance of multivalent binding to transport receptors via NLSs and the effect of size on import efficiency. Our findings have implications for understanding the export of large cargoes and provide a framework for future studies on nucleocytoplasmic transport.

    **Title:** CD28 Persistence is Essential for Helper T Cell Polarization in Response to Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the role of CD28 in maintaining T cell responses following activation?

    **Methods:** To investigate the function of CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice (Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+) where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. We then infected these mice with Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric mucosal murine pathogen, and analyzed the immune response.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that continued CD28 expression is crucial for effector CD4+ T cells following infection. Specifically, we found that maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 (Th1) cells and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells during viral infection. Moreover, persistent CD28 expression is necessary for the clearance of Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that CD28 persistence is essential for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, highlighting a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming. Our results suggest that CD28 plays a critical role in the expansion and maintenance of Th1 and Tfh cells, which are essential for effective immune responses against pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals a previously undescribed role for CD28 in maintaining T cell responses following activation. We show that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for the expansion of Th1 cells and for the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the immune response to infection and highlight the importance of CD28 in maintaining effective T cell responses.

    **Title:** Molecular Mechanisms of Helical Cell Shape Maintenance in Helicobacter pylori

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms that enable Helicobacter pylori to maintain its helical cell shape, which is necessary for efficient stomach colonization?

    **Methods:** We employed quantitative 3D microscopy analysis of short pulses with metabolic probes to investigate peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis patterning in wild-type H. pylori cells. We also used immunofluorescence to study the localization of cytoskeletal proteins MreB and CcmA.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PG synthesis is enhanced at both negative and positive Gaussian curvatures on the sidewall of H. pylori cells. We found that MreB is most abundant at negative Gaussian curvature, while CcmA is most abundant at positive Gaussian curvature. Strains expressing CcmA variants with altered polymerization properties lose helical shape and associated positive Gaussian curvatures.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that MreB and CcmA promote PG synthesis at negative and positive Gaussian curvatures, respectively, and that this patterning is one mechanism necessary for maintaining helical shape in H. pylori. We propose a model where MreB and CcmA work together to control PG synthesis and maintain sidewall curvature.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of helical cell shape maintenance in H. pylori. We demonstrate that H. pylori uses distinct mechanisms to achieve the broad distribution of sidewall Gaussian curvature necessary for its helical shape. Our findings have implications for understanding the biology of H. pylori and its role in stomach colonization, as well as for the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat H. pylori infections.

    **Title:** Cdc48 Orchestrates Mitochondrial Dynamics through Ubiquitin-Dependent Regulation of E3 Ligases and Deubiquitylases

    **Research Question:** How does Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, regulate mitochondrial dynamics by integrating the activities of E3 ligases and deubiquitylases (DUBs)?

    **Methods:** Using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches, we investigated the role of Cdc48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. We analyzed the activities of two DUBs, Ubp12 and Ubp2, which exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that Cdc48 integrates the activities of Ubp12 and Ubp2, which are themselves ubiquitylated. Cdc48 promotes proteolysis of Ubp12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1, while loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2 and facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1, inhibiting fusion. This cascade of ubiquitylation events ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation, allowing mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel enzymatic cascade consisting of Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2, which fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of Fzo1. This cascade provides a mechanistic explanation for the opposing effects of Ubp12 and Ubp2 on mitochondrial fusion and ubiquitin homeostasis. Furthermore, our results revise recent findings linking Ubp2 and Mdm30, highlighting the complexity of ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study unravels a new cascade of ubiquitylation events, comprising Cdc48 and two DUBs, which ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation at levels sufficient to allow mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. This work provides new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and highlights the importance of Cdc48 in integrating the activities of E3 ligases and DUBs to maintain cellular homeostasis.

    **Title:** Categorical Organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC) in Sighted and Blind Individuals: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Study

    **Research Question:** Is vision necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC)?

    **Methods:** We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate VOTC responses to eight categories presented acoustically in sighted and early blind individuals, and visually in a separate sighted group.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind individuals, using a representational structure and connectivity partially similar to the one found in vision. Notably, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group than the sighted group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision. Crucially, VOTC in blind individuals represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response, despite qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision can emerge in VOTC in the absence of visual experience, and that such categorical response to sounds is actually enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind individuals. These results have significant implications for our understanding of cross-modal plasticity and the neural basis of categorical perception. By harnessing the opportunities provided by representational similarity analysis, we demonstrate that categorical membership is the main factor that predicts the representational structure of sounds in VOTC in blind people, rather than lower-level acoustical attributes of sounds.

    **Significance:** This study contributes to our understanding of the neural basis of categorical perception and the role of visual experience in shaping the organization of the VOTC. The findings have implications for the development of novel rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments and for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cross-modal plasticity.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Behavioral Manipulation by the Fungal Pathogen Entomophthora muscae in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** How does the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae manipulate the behavior of its host, Drosophila melanogaster, at the molecular level?

**Methods:** We isolated a strain of E. muscae infecting wild Drosophila and established a laboratory system to infect D. melanogaster. We observed the characteristic moribund behaviors of E. muscae infection in lab-infected flies, including upward climbing, proboscis extension, and wing-raising. We also found that E. muscae invades the nervous system of D. melanogaster, suggesting a direct means of behavioral manipulation.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that E. muscae invades the nervous system of D. melanogaster, granting the fungus direct access to host neurons. We propose that this invasion may be mechanistically important for achieving behavioral manipulation of the host fly. We also demonstrate that E. muscae 'Berkeley' is capable of causing patent infection in hosts outside of Drosophilidae, including house flies.

**Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of parasitic manipulation of host behavior. The E. muscae-D. melanogaster system provides a powerful model for studying the molecular basis of behavioral manipulation, leveraging the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster. This system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of behavioral manipulation by E. muscae and highlights the potential of the E. muscae-D. melanogaster system as a model for studying parasitic manipulation of host behavior. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular basis of behavioral manipulation by E. muscae and to explore the potential applications of this system in understanding the biology of parasitic manipulation.

    **Title:** Systematic Analysis of RNA Degradation Pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Reveals Insights into RNA Processing and Surveillance

    **Research Question:** How do RNA degradation factors interact with different classes of RNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and what are the implications for RNA processing and surveillance?

    **Methods:** We employed photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) to generate transcriptome-wide protein binding profiles for 30 general RNA degradation factors in S. cerevisiae.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes, consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Global analysis suggests that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of RNA degradation pathways in S. cerevisiae, revealing how degradation factors interact with different classes of RNAs. The results suggest that decapping is a rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation, and that decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons. Our findings also highlight the importance of the nuclear surveillance machinery in targeting aberrant nuclear RNAs and processing snoRNAs.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a rich resource for future studies of eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism. The transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in S. cerevisiae will facilitate the understanding of how RNA degradation pathways are selected and how the RNA sequence influences this selection. Our results have significant implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression and the surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in eukaryotic cells.
Title: Temporal Dynamics of Gene Expression Underpin Responses to Internal and Environmental Stimuli: Unveiling the Role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac Bivalent Chromatin in Camalexin Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana

    Abstract:

    Background: Gene regulation in eukaryotes involves dynamic changes in chromatin states and the recruitment of transcriptional machinery in response to internal and environmental stimuli. Camalexin, a potent defense compound in Arabidopsis thaliana, is rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the rapid activation of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to pathogen signals remain unclear.

    Research Question: What is the role of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of camalexin biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis thaliana?

    Methods: We combined publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping to investigate the epigenetic landscape of camalexin biosynthesis genes. We examined the co-localization of trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3K18ac) on camalexin biosynthesis genes.

    Main Findings: We identified a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin, which we named kairostat, formed by the co-localization of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin biosynthesis genes. Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac showed altered induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation, indicating that both modifications are required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response.

    Implications: Our study provides new insights into the epigenetic regulation of camalexin biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, or kairostat, plays a crucial role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of epigenetic modifications in regulating gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. The discovery of kairostat, a novel type of bivalent chromatin, provides a molecular handle for future investigations into the mechanisms of gene regulation in plants. Further studies are needed to elucidate the interactions between transcription factors and proteins that deposit or remove epigenetic marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals.

    **Title:** Epigenetic Regulation of Neurogenic Astrocytes by EZH2 in the Adult Mouse and Human Brain

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in maintaining the neurogenic competence of astrocytes in the adult mouse and human brain?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of EZH2 in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ). We used a combination of genetic deletion and rescue experiments to determine the role of EZH2 in SVZ NSC proliferation and neurogenesis.

    **Main Findings:** We found that EZH2 is a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult mouse brain and is required for both cell proliferation and neuronal lineage specification. EZH2 directly represses the Ink4a/Arf locus to enable SVZ NSC self-renewal. Furthermore, we identified distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. In the human brain, EZH2 was also expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ, suggesting that this Polycomb repressive factor plays key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis.

    **Implications:** Our results provide novel insights into the complex role that EZH2 plays in normal development and gliomagenesis. The identification of EZH2 as a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis. Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our studies establish EZH2 as a key epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SVZ astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology. These findings highlight the importance of EZH2 in maintaining the neurogenic competence of astrocytes in the adult mouse and human brain, and have significant implications for our understanding of regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.

    **Title:** Viral Modulation of Microbial Communities and Ecosystem Functions in Marine Oxygen Minimum Zones

    **Research Question:** How do viruses interact with uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), and what are the implications for ecosystem functions?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from uncultivated SUP05 bacteria isolated from a model OMZ to identify viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. We analyzed 127 SAGs and 186 microbial and viral metagenomes from the Saanich Inlet water column over a 3-year time interval.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ∼1/3 of SUP05 bacteria is viral-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency was most severe. We observed Microviridae clonality, suggesting the recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, and systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses, indicating previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests that SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus-host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs. Our results highlight the importance of viruses in shaping microbial communities and ecosystem functions in OMZs.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between viruses and uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in OMZs. Our findings suggest that viruses play a crucial role in modulating biogeochemical cycling and energy metabolism in these ecosystems. The discovery of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase highlights the potential for viruses to reprogram their host's metabolic pathways. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the role of viruses in shaping microbial communities and ecosystem functions in OMZs, and highlight the need for further research into the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts in these ecosystems.
Title: Elucidating the Role of TTC26/DYF13 in Intraflagellar Transport and Ciliary Motility

    Abstract:
    Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a highly conserved mechanism responsible for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. Despite its importance, the functions of individual IFT proteins remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of TTC26/DYF13, a putative IFT complex B protein, in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in both mammalian cells and C. reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility. Notably, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed a specific set of proteins involved in motility that were depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These findings suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting distinct cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.

    Our results indicate that TTC26/DYF13 plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella, rather than being essential for ciliogenesis or IFT particle assembly. This is in contrast to other IFT proteins, which are necessary for cilia/flagella assembly. The dyf13 mutant flagella were shorter and exhibited pronounced motility defects, while IFT particle movement was normal. Comparative proteomic analysis of flagellar proteins in the dyf13 mutant further supports a specific function for TTC26/DYF13 in transporting a subset of cargo proteins involved in flagellar motility.

    These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the IFT machinery and its role in ciliary motility. The discovery that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting distinct cargo subsets highlights the complexity and specificity of the IFT process. Further analysis of TTC26/DYF13 and other IFT proteins will be necessary to clarify their roles in determining cilia and flagella length and motility.

    Title: Lymphatic Endothelial Cells Promote Melanoma Metastasis through MMP14-Dependent Notch3 and β1-Integrin Activation

    Research Question: How do lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) interact with melanoma cells to facilitate distant organ metastasis?

    Methods: We employed a combination of 2D and 3D co-culture models of melanoma cells with LECs, transcriptome profiling, in vitro functional studies, and a zebrafish xenograft/metastasis assay to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying LEC-induced melanoma metastasis.

    Main Findings: We found that exposure of expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells to LECs in 3D co-culture facilitated distant organ metastasis in mice. Notably, the metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix that was dependent on matrix-metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14), Notch3, and β1-integrin. Unexpectedly, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation. Moreover, MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts.

    Implications: Our study uncovers a unique mechanism whereby LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype. The interaction of melanoma cells with LECs induces MMP14-dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation, leading to increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying LEC-induced melanoma metastasis and highlight the importance of MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin in this process. The LEC-melanoma interaction model established in this study has high potential for identifying previously unrecognized pathways and molecules contributing to lymphatic metastasis of melanoma. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat melanoma metastasis.

    **Title:** Conditional Inactivation of miR-9 Reveals a Key Role in Dendritic Growth and Synaptic Transmission in Vivo

    **Background:** MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miR-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain, but its function in dendritic and synaptic development remains poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of miR-9 in dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo?

    **Methods:** We developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line that allows for conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. We used this novel approach to investigate the function of miR-9 in dendritic and synaptic development.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. We found that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth and impaired synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.

    **Implications:** Our study defines a key role for miR-9 in postmitotic differentiation of neurons and highlights the importance of miR-9 in regulating dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Our findings suggest that miR-9 is a key player in neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the function of miR-9 in the brain and highlights the importance of miR-9 in regulating dendritic growth and synaptic transmission. The development of a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allows for conditional inactivation of miR-9 in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner, providing a powerful tool for investigating the function of miR-9 in vivo. Our results have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dendritic growth and synaptic transmission, and may provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Atypical Functional Brain Organization in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Unveiling the Neural Bases of Social Visual Engagement Difficulties

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between early social visual engagement difficulties in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and atypical functional brain organization?

    **Methods:** We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate intrinsic functional connectivity between neural circuits in a large sample of ASD toddlers and non-ASD comparison groups.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks is a hallmark of early ASD development. Specifically, we identified a subtype of ASD characterized by pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties (GeoPref ASD), which is associated with marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. Furthermore, increased DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity is linked to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoPref ASD.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature of GeoPref ASD, which may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides robust evidence for atypical intrinsic functional brain organization in early ASD development, involving circuitry relevant to social visual engagement. Our results highlight the importance of heterogeneity in early social engagement in explaining functional connectivity differences in ASD toddlers. The identification of GeoPref ASD as a distinct subtype with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties and associated DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity has significant clinical and translational implications for early diagnosis and intervention in ASD.

    **Title:** Structure-Dependent Hematopoiesis in Drosophila Melanogaster: A Novel Paradigm for Blood Cell Homeostasis

    **Research Question:** How do Drosophila melanogaster larvae maintain blood cell homeostasis during larval development?

    **Methods:** We investigated the hematopoietic organs of Drosophila melanogaster larvae, focusing on the lymph gland and its role in producing plasmatocytes and crystal cells. We used a combination of histological and molecular techniques to analyze the development and differentiation of these cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. We also found that the microenvironment provided by the hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate signaling.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel hematopoietic organ in Drosophila melanogaster that relies on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis. This finding creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishes further parallels with vertebrate systems. The study of hematopoietic organs structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled.

    **Conclusions:** Our research provides new insights into the mechanisms of hematopoiesis in Drosophila melanogaster, highlighting the importance of structure-dependent signaling events in promoting blood cell homeostasis. The discovery of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation into crystal cells expands our understanding of the hematopoietic process and has implications for the study of hematopoiesis in other organisms, including vertebrates. Further investigation of this novel hematopoietic organ will contribute to our understanding of blood cell development and homeostasis, ultimately shedding light on the fundamental questions of Drosophila hematopoiesis.

    **Title:** Aneuploidy Facilitates Organismal Evolution through Gene-Dosage Compensation in Wild Yeast Isolates

    **Research Question:** How do cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy, a condition where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes, until new phenotypes evolve?

    **Methods:** We investigated aneuploidy in wild yeast isolates and generated diploid strain panels with cells carrying two, three, or four copies of affected chromosomes to study gene-dosage compensation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which exhibit lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We found that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes, and genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of gene amplification. Furthermore, we discovered that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009 by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation.

    **Implications:** Our study presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy, providing a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of how cells tolerate duplication of toxic genes long enough for new phenotypes to evolve.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide new insight into the long-standing conundrum of how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy. We show that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains exhibit lower-than-expected expression, which is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes. Our study highlights the importance of gene-dosage compensation in buffering gene amplification and facilitating phenotypic evolution in wild yeast isolates. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of aneuploidy and its role in organismal evolution.

    Title: Unveiling Xenopsin: A Novel Type of Opsin-Expressing Cell in Flatworms

    Research Question: What is the role of xenopsin, a recently classified subtype of opsin, in photoreception and phototransduction in flatworms?

    Methods: We investigated the expression and function of xenopsin in the flatworm Maritigrella crozieri using immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural analysis, and functional assays in human cells.

    Main Findings: We found that xenopsin is expressed in ciliary cells of the eyes in the larva and in extraocular cells around the brain in the adult. These extraocular cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole (phaosome). Functional assays in human cells showed that Maritigrella xenopsin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi.

    Implications: Our findings highlight similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and reveal a novel type of opsin-expressing cell that, like jawed vertebrate rods, encloses the ciliary membrane within their own plasma membrane. This discovery challenges our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution by deviating from the invertebrate trend of extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors.

    Conclusions: Our study provides molecular and functional evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms. Xenopsin's ability to drive phototransduction in live human cell assays and its expression in ciliary cells in Maritigrella add to our understanding of the evolution of photoreception and phototransduction in metazoans. The discovery of xenopsin+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protostome larvae highlights the diversity of ciliary photoreceptors in metazoans, particularly in the outer segment where ciliary membranes increase cell surface area through membrane stacking or greater numbers of cilia, or both. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of photoreception and phototransduction in animals.
Title: Integration of Spatial and Temporal Cues in Drosophila Neuroblasts Reveals a Sequential Specification Model of Neuronal Diversity

    Abstract:
    The integration of spatial and temporal cues is essential for the specification of neuronal diversity in the developing nervous system. However, the mechanisms by which these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila neuroblasts as a model system, we investigated whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially to specify neuronal diversity. We employed Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback (Hb) temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that produce different progeny. Our results show that Hb targets were distinct in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Furthermore, each neuroblast had unique open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Notably, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. These findings support a sequential specification model, where early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage. Our study provides new insights into the integration of spatial and temporal cues in neural progenitors and has implications for understanding the mechanisms of neuronal diversity in both Drosophila and mammals.

    Research Question:
    How are spatial and temporal cues integrated in neural progenitors to specify neuronal diversity?

    Methods:
    We used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two Drosophila neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that produce different progeny.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Hb targets were distinct in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Each neuroblast had unique open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. The Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4.

    Implications:
    Our study provides new insights into the integration of spatial and temporal cues in neural progenitors and has implications for understanding the mechanisms of neuronal diversity in both Drosophila and mammals.

    Conclusions:
    Our findings support a sequential specification model, where early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.

    Title: Unveiling the Gating Mechanism of P2X Receptors through Photo-Switchable Cross-Linkers

    Research Question: How do P2X receptors open their transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP, and what is the molecular mechanism underlying this process?

    Methods: We employed photo-switchable cross-linkers as "molecular tweezers" to monitor inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints were combined with computational studies using molecular dynamics simulations to provide high-resolution models of the channel in both open and closed states.

    Main Findings: Our results reveal that the extent of outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure, and that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These findings provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors.

    Implications: Our study establishes a versatile strategy for investigating the function of membrane proteins using photo-switchable cross-linkers and molecular dynamics simulations. This approach can be applied to other membrane proteins to elucidate their gating mechanisms.

    Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the P2X2 receptor contains a critical "hinge" in its TM2 helices, which facilitates their vertical bending and allows the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer during activation. This study provides the first application of photo-switchable derivatives to investigate the mechanism of pore gating in P2X receptors, and sheds light on the long-standing controversy surrounding the mechanism of P2X receptor activation. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the function of P2X receptors and other membrane proteins, and highlight the potential of photo-switchable cross-linkers as a powerful tool for structural biology research.
Title: Cell-Type-Specific Regulation of Cytokinesis in the Four-Cell Caenorhabditis elegans Embryo Reveals Both Intrinsic and Extrinsic Mechanisms

    Abstract:
    Cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, has long been thought to be a conserved process across animal cells. However, recent evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types may exhibit more variation than previously assumed. This study investigates the mechanisms of cytokinetic variation in the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, where each blastomere has a distinct cell fate specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. Our results show that in one cell (P2), cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell (EMS), this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. Furthermore, we found that both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened. These findings highlight the complexity of cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types and provide new insights into the mechanisms that ensure robust cytokinesis in the four-cell C. elegans embryo.

    Methods:
    We used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We employed fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment to inactivate two cytokinesis proteins essential for contractile ring constriction: the motor myosin-II (NMY-2) and the diaphanous formin CYK-1.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that there is cell-type-specific variation in the molecular requirement for forminCYK-1, but not myosin-IINMY-2, during cytokinesis in the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We found that in one cell (P2), cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell (EMS), this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. These results highlight the complexity of cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types and provide new insights into the mechanisms that ensure robust cytokinesis in the four-cell C. elegans embryo.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study reveals that cell-type-specific regulation of cytokinesis in the four-cell C. elegans embryo is a complex process that involves both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms. These findings have important implications for our understanding of cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types and provide new insights into the mechanisms that ensure robust cytokinesis in the four-cell C. elegans embryo.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Role of the Flagellar Sheath in Host-Microbe Interactions: A Novel Mechanism of Immune Activation

    **Research Question:** What is the functional role of the flagellar sheath in mediating host-microbe interactions, particularly in the context of bacterial colonization and immune response activation?

    **Methods:** We employed the model squid-vibrio symbiosis to investigate the effect of flagellar sheath rotation on the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent immunogen, in both Vibrio fischeri and its pathogenic congener Vibrio cholerae.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both V. fischeri and V. cholerae promotes the release of LPS, a previously unrecognized role for the flagellar sheath in mediating host immune responses. This observation challenges the long-held hypothesis that the sheath allows bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, as they suggest that the flagellar sheath may actually trigger, rather than circumvent, host immune responses. This novel mechanism of immune activation raises important biophysical questions about sheathed-flagellum function and its contribution to bacterial virulence.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a previously unrecognized role for the flagellar sheath in mediating host-microbe interactions, highlighting the importance of this enigmatic structure in bacterial colonization and immune response activation. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, including characterizing the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, identifying squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS, and determining the role of flagellin in activating host responses. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections.

    **Title:** Genome Instability through Centromere-Mediated Uniparental Genome Elimination in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of centromere-mediated uniparental genome elimination in generating genomic instability and aneuploidy in Arabidopsis plants?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of hybridization between Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histones H3 (CENH3) on genome stability and aneuploidy. Specifically, we analyzed the ploidy types resulting from centromere-mediated uniparental genome elimination and examined the role of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that hybridization between Arabidopsis plants expressing different CENH3 leads to extreme chromosomal restructuring, resulting in the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer. Analysis of breakpoint junctions indicates that breaks are followed by repair through NHEJ or stalled fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of the NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, suggesting a role for NHEJ in the formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species. Our results also suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays an important role in repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes, and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a tractable, natural system for investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders. The findings have implications for understanding the role of centromere-mediated uniparental genome elimination in generating genomic instability and aneuploidy, and highlight the importance of NHEJ in repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes.

    **Research Question:** How does Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) regulate apoptosis resistance in B cells during early infection, particularly in the absence of LMP1/NFκB activity?

    **Methods:** We employed BH3 profiling to investigate mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis in uninfected and EBV-infected B cells. We analyzed the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, MCL-1, and BFL-1 in human peripheral blood B cells and EBV-infected cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that uninfected B cells rely solely on BCL-2 for survival, while EBV-infected cells upregulate MCL-1 and BFL-1 to suppress apoptosis. We identified a novel role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in regulating MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription, leading to apoptosis resistance in EBV-infected cells.

    **Implications:** This study reveals a new mechanism of apoptosis resistance in EBV-infected B cells, which is distinct from the previously known role of LMP1/NFκB. Our findings suggest that EBNA3A plays a critical role in the early phase of EBV infection, where EBNAs are expressed with little or no LMP1 or NFκB activity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of apoptosis in EBV-infected B cells and highlights the importance of EBNA3A in lymphomagenesis. The dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms, from BCL-2 to MCL-1/BCL-2 to BFL-1, is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on the regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by EBNA3A. These findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of EBV-associated lymphomas and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting EBNA3A.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Specialized Metabolite Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana: A Multifaceted Approach

    **Research Question:** How do genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersect to shape chemotypic variation in specialized metabolites across a population of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, measuring the variation in specialized metabolites, specifically aliphatic glucosinolates (GSLs), in seeds across Europe. We integrated geographic, environmental, demographic, and genetic data to investigate the factors influencing chemotypic variation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and genetic processes all contribute to the specific chemotypes and their distribution across the population. We identified frequent independently generated alleles at causal loci in specialized metabolism, suggesting potential within-species convergence. These findings provide new insights into the complexity of selective forces and mechanisms shaping the generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing local adaptation.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the intersection of environmental pressure, demography, and genomic complexity in understanding the evolution of specialized metabolism within a species. The Arabidopsis GSL pathway serves as an optimal model for studying species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation, given the known identity of the biosynthetic pathway and major causal loci for natural variation.

    **Conclusions:** This research provides a new perspective on the intricate relationships between genetics, geography, environment, and demography in shaping chemotypic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of specialized metabolism and local adaptation in plants, and highlight the importance of considering the complex interplay of factors influencing trait evolution. The discovery of frequent independently generated alleles at causal loci in specialized metabolism raises questions about how pathways with this level of diversity and structural variation pass through speciation boundaries, underscoring the need for further research in this area.

    **Title:** Oncogenic Ras Converts Apoptotic Caspases into Tumor Promoters through a Feedback Amplification Loop

    **Research Question:** How do apoptotic caspases, traditionally considered tumor suppressors, contribute to tumor growth and proliferation in the presence of oncogenic Ras mutations?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of caspases in a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila, specifically in scrib−/− RasV12 cells, which harbor oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that oncogenic Ras suppresses the apoptotic activity of caspases and maintains scrib−/− RasV12 cells in an ‘undead’-like condition. Instead of inducing apoptosis, caspases now promote the generation of intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are required for malignant growth and tissue invasion of surviving neoplastic cells. We further show that ROS recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells, which signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK, in turn, promotes and amplifies caspase activity, constituting a feedback amplification loop that is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the traditional view of caspases as tumor suppressors and reveal a novel mechanism by which oncogenic Ras converts apoptotic caspases into tumor promoters. This feedback amplification loop highlights the complex interplay between tumorous epithelial cells, macrophage-like immune cells, and ROS in promoting tumor growth and invasion.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression and suggests that targeting the caspase-ROS-JNK feedback loop may be a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit tumor growth and improve organismal survival. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel cancer therapies.

    **Title:** Temporal Compression of Social Interactions: The Role of Oxytocin in Mediating Perceived Time

    **Research Question:** Does oxytocin play a role in mediating the subjective duration of social interactions, and is this effect influenced by an individual's social cognitive competency and autistic-like tendency?

    **Methods:** We conducted a series of experiments (Experiments 1-5) to investigate the relationship between social interactions, subjective time, and oxytocin. Participants were presented with motion sequences of agents acting communicatively or non-communicatively, and asked to estimate the duration of the sequences. We also administered intranasal oxytocin or atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, to participants to examine the effects on subjective time perception.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively are perceived to be significantly shorter in duration compared to those acting non-communicatively. This effect, known as temporal compression, is negatively correlated with an individual's autistic-like tendency. Critically, intranasal oxytocin administration restored the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas atosiban administration diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that perceived time is not a faithful representation of physical time, but is instead highly idiosyncratic and influenced by an individual's personality traits, such as social cognitive competency. Moreover, our results indicate that oxytocin plays a key role in mediating the subjective duration of social interactions, further supporting its involvement in human social cognition.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between social interactions, subjective time, and oxytocin. The findings have implications for our understanding of social cognition and the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior. Specifically, they suggest that oxytocin may be a potential therapeutic target for improving social skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects and to explore the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in ASD.
Title: Elucidating the Impact of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 Mutations on Viral Infection and Immune Evasion

    Abstract:
    The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has raised concerns about their potential to enhance viral transmission and immune evasion. We investigated the effects of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. Using a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis, we found that most RBD mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, with the exceptions being mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, while the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape. Furthermore, we examined the effects of combinations of RBD mutations, including those present in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha lineage, and the Beta and Gamma variants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immune evasion, and highlight the need for continued surveillance of RBD and ACE2 mutations.

    Methods:
    We performed a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the RBD/ACE2 interaction using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) at a physiological temperature (37°C). We analyzed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P1) variants.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that most RBD mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, with the exceptions being mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. The N501Y and S477N mutations enhanced transmission primarily by enhancing binding, while the K417N/T mutations facilitated immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhanced binding and immune escape.

    Implications:
    Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immune evasion. The increased affinity of RBD mutations for ACE2 may enhance viral transmission and disease severity, while the K417N/T mutations may facilitate immune escape. The E484K mutation may enhance both binding and immune evasion. Our results also highlight the need for continued surveillance of RBD and ACE2 mutations.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides a detailed analysis of the effects of RBD and ACE2 mutations on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. Our findings suggest that RBD mutations can enhance transmission and immune evasion, while ACE2 mutations may increase the risk of infection and/or severe disease in carriers of these variants. Further studies are needed to fully understand the impact of these mutations on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease severity.

    **Title:** Mapping Directional Gene-Gene Interactions to Reveal Regulatory Relationships in Drosophila Cells

    **Research Question:** How do gene-gene interactions shape complex phenotypes and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease?

    **Methods:** We employed combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. We selected 1367 genes implicated in key biological processes, including signalling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation, and protein turnover control.

    **Main Findings:** Our study presents the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic interaction profiles in metazoan cells to date. We quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging and inferred gene functions based on statistical genetic interactions, predicted protein complexes, and clustered processes by similarity. Our unbiased mapping and automated inference of directional epistatic interactions revealed a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal, and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle. Notably, we identified an epistatic relationship between the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, which is conserved in human cancer cells.

    **Implications:** This study provides a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and offers a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations. Our findings highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in shaping complex phenotypes and modifying the effects of mutations during development and disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships. The epistatic network of mitotic genes revealed by our study provides new insights into the regulatory relationships between chromatin remodelling and RAS signalling, which has implications for our understanding of cancer biology. Overall, this research provides a valuable resource for the scientific community and highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in understanding complex biological processes.
Title: Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Heterostyly in Primula: Identification of the CYP734A50 Gene as the G Locus Determining Style-Length Dimorphism

    Abstract:
    Heterostyly, a widespread floral adaptation promoting outbreeding, remains poorly understood in terms of its genetic basis and evolutionary origin. In Primula (primroses), heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene, which determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we investigate the genetic basis of heterostyly in Primula and identify the CYP734A50 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. We demonstrate that CYP734A50 is present only on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and shed light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene. We propose that CYP734A50 arose via a lineage-specific gene duplication and gained style-specific expression in the ancestor of the Primulaceae, representing a dominant style-shortening mutation. Our findings open the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus and provide a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism.

    Research Question: What is the genetic basis of heterostyly in Primula, and what is the identity of the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism?

    Methods: We sequenced style transcriptomes of heterostylous and homostylous Primula species to identify the CYP734A50 gene and investigated its expression and function using VIGS (Virus-Induced Gene Silencing) experiments.

    Main Findings: We found that CYP734A50 is present only on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. We also demonstrated that CYP734A50 arose via a lineage-specific gene duplication and gained style-specific expression in the ancestor of the Primulaceae.

    Implications: Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and shed light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene. The identification of CYP734A50 as the G locus opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus and provides a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism.

    Conclusions: Our study elucidates the genetic basis of heterostyly in Primula and identifies the CYP734A50 gene as the G locus determining the style-length dimorphism. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of the S-locus and the mechanisms underlying adaptive polymorphisms in plants.

    **Title:** Kisspeptin and Neurokinin B Neurocircuits in Pubertal Development and Fertility

    **Research Question:** How do Kisspeptin (Kiss1) and Neurokinin B (NKB) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1ARH) regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons during pubertal development and fertility?

    **Methods:** We employed optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice to characterize the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity.

    **Main Findings:** High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons evoked the local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons through a synaptic mechanism involving glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role in driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function. The synchronized activity of Kiss1ARH neurons promotes kisspeptin release, which stimulates GnRH release in the median eminence, while also exciting Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate release to generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying the synchronized activity of Kiss1ARH neurons and their role in regulating GnRH neurons during pubertal development and fertility. The identification of the dual role of Kiss1ARH neurons in driving episodic secretion of GnRH and exciting Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons highlights the importance of these neurons in coordinating reproductive function. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of reproductive physiology and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for reproductive disorders.

    **Title:** BMP Signalling Regulates Differentiation by Blocking Downregulation of Cdh1 and Priming Pluripotent Cells for Mesoderm Differentiation

    **Research Question:** How does Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signalling control differentiation in pluripotent cells, and what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of BMP signalling in regulating differentiation in pluripotent cells using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches, including gene expression analysis, cell culture experiments, and functional assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that BMP signalling maintains pluripotency by blocking the downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. We found that loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus reinforcing the block to neural differentiation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues. We propose that BMP signalling feeds into this control mechanism by maintaining Cdh1 expression, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which BMP signalling controls differentiation in pluripotent cells. We conclude that BMP signalling maintains pluripotency by blocking the downregulation of Cdh1, and that BMP also primes pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation by imposing a posterior identity that is incompatible with a neural fate. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment, and highlight the complex interplay between extrinsic cues and morphogenetic events in regulating cell fate specification.

    **Title:** Cep120 Regulates Centrosome Homeostasis and Ciliary Assembly during Quiescence

    **Research Question:** How are the asymmetric properties of centrioles in quiescent cells established and maintained, and what is the role of Cep120 in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of Cep120, a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, in quiescent mouse and human cells. We depleted Cep120 using RNA interference (RNAi) and examined the effects on centrosome homeostasis, microtubule-nucleation activity, and ciliary assembly and signaling.

    **Main Findings:** Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent cells led to the accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170, resulting in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. This, in turn, caused aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that Cep120 plays a critical role in maintaining centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting the untimely maturation of the daughter centriole. Loss of Cep120 disrupts the localization of centriolar satellites, leading to defective ciliary assembly and signaling. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliopathies, such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that Cep120 is a key regulator of centrosome homeostasis and ciliary assembly during quiescence. The loss of Cep120 disrupts the asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at the centrosome, leading to aberrant microtubule organization, dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliopathies and highlight the importance of Cep120 in maintaining centrosome homeostasis and ciliary function.

    **Title:** Neuron-Glia Interactions in the Developing Retina: Spatio-Temporal Characteristics and Molecular Pathways

    **Research Question:** How do neurons and Müller glial cells (MCs) communicate in the developing retina, and what are the molecular pathways involved in this interaction?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators or glutamate sensors expressed specifically in MCs to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways of neuron-glia interactions in the developing retina.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that retinal waves induce calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, demonstrating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. We found that the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in visual cortex and hippocampus, where cholinergic neuron stimulation leads to astrocyte calcium transients via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. However, during glutamatergic waves, MC calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, indicating that the responsiveness of MCs changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses. The proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from postnatal day 9 (P9) to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves, indicating that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling.

    **Conclusions:** Our study elucidates the spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways of neuron-glia interactions in the developing retina, highlighting the importance of neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses in enabling correlated activity between neurons and MCs during a critical period of retinal maturation. These findings have implications for our understanding of the development of neural circuits and the role of glial cells in modulating neuronal activity.

    **Title:** Estimating Postmortem Interval (PMI) using Microbial Community Changes in Decomposing Corpses: A Novel Forensic Approach

    **Research Question:** Can microbial community changes in decomposing corpses be used to estimate the postmortem interval (PMI) with high accuracy and precision?

    **Methods:** We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses as they decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days. We characterized bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes using a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. We demonstrate that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI, providing a novel method that avoids many of the limitations associated with existing techniques, such as forensic entomology.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the field of forensic science, as they provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system. This knowledge can be used to develop a reliable and accurate method for estimating PMI, which is critical in death investigations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI. We rigorously tested hypotheses long-held by the forensic community about the role of microbes in corpse decomposition and demonstrated that microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events, such as PMI. Our results have the potential to revolutionize the field of forensic science and provide a new tool for investigators to estimate PMI with high accuracy and precision.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Origins of Hox-TALE Patterning Networks in Eumetazoans

    **Research Question:** How did Hox-TALE interactions evolve to provide positional information in bilaterian animals, and what are the implications for our understanding of eukaryote evolution?

    **Methods:** Using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we investigated the evolutionary origins of Hox-TALE interactions and their role in patterning functions in Eumetazoans.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Hox-TALE networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. We found that these networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Notably, Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later exploited for patterning functions in Bilateria. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. We propose that this original molecular system was co-opted by various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumetazoan phyla for axis or tissue patterning.

    **Conclusions:** Our study describes how the molecular cues underlying the Hox-TALE patterning system in Bilateria were established stepwise during eukaryote evolution. We highlight the importance of Hox genes in morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Our results also underscore the non-universality of genetic mechanisms underlying embryonic development, as developmental genes can display highly dissimilar expression patterns or be absent in non-bilaterian lineages. Overall, our study provides new insights into the evolutionary origins of Hox-TALE interactions and their role in patterning functions in Eumetazoans.

    **Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of AMPA Receptor Trafficking in Synapses using Super-Resolution Microscopy

    **Research Question:** How do fluorophore size and photostability influence the trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) outside of and within post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rat synapses?

    **Methods:** We employed super-resolution microscopy to examine the diffusion of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes (≈4 nm), small quantum dots (sQDs, ≈10 nm diameter), and big quantum dots (bQDs, >20 nm) in rat synapses. AMPARs were coupled to these fluorophores via different-sized linkers.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or sQDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains within PSDs, which were stable for 15 min or longer. In contrast, <10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile, whereas 5-10% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90-95% were extrasynaptic. These findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSDs with a lifetime >15 min and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes.

    **Implications:** Our study challenges the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD "slots." Instead, our results indicate that AMPARs can rapidly enter stable nanodomains within PSDs, which may have important implications for our understanding of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.

    **Conclusions:** Using super-resolution microscopy and sQDs, we were able to study the dynamics of AMPAR nanodomains in synapses for extended periods (up to 60 min). Our findings suggest that the localization of AMPA receptors is predominantly at synaptic regions, with typically one nanodomain per synapse. The use of smaller fluorophores (sQDs or organic dyes) revealed that AMPARs are largely confined to PSD nanodomains, whereas larger fluorophores (bQDs) resulted in extrasynaptic accumulation. These results highlight the importance of fluorophore size and photostability in studying AMPAR trafficking and synaptic function.

    **Title:** SUMOylation of NaV1.2 Channels Mediates the Early Response of Central Neurons to Hypoxia

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism underlying the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia, characterized by an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (INa)?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) subjected to acute hypoxia. We used electrophysiology and biochemical techniques to examine the SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels and its effects on INa.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that hypoxia activates the SUMO pathway in CGN, leading to the SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the cell surface. This SUMOylation increases INa by shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation, allowing depolarizing steps to evoke larger sodium currents. The time-course of SUMOylation of single NaV1.2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 channels are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions to reduce damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons. The rapid SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the plasma membrane in response to hypoxia provides a novel mechanism for the early response of central neurons to hypoxia.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase in INa in response to acute hypoxia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. The SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 channels may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the early response of central neurons to hypoxia and highlight potential strategies for neuroprotection.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Thermal Optima and Limits of Ross River Virus Transmission: A Mechanistic Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the thermal optima and limits of Ross River virus (RRV) transmission, and how do they influence the geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease dynamics?

    **Methods:** We developed a mechanistic model for the thermal response of RRV, an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. We parameterized the model using data from two key vector species, Cx. annulirostris and Ae. vigilax.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that RRV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming is likely to increase transmission in temperate areas (where most Australians live) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. Identifying transmission optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear thermal responses, rather than simply assuming that transmission increases with temperature, can more accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the value of mechanistic modeling in understanding the thermal biology of vector-borne diseases. Our results have important implications for predicting the impact of climate change on RRV transmission and highlight the need for further research on the thermal responses of other vector-borne pathogens. By characterizing nonlinear thermal responses, we can improve our understanding of disease dynamics and develop more effective strategies for disease control and prevention.

**Title:** Deciphering the Behavioral Correlates of Motor Cortical Beta Oscillations: A Neurofeedback Study in Macaques

**Research Question:** How are changes in population neural activity, beta oscillations, and behavior linked during motor tasks?

**Methods:** We recorded multi-scale neural activity from the motor cortex of three macaques while they performed a novel neurofeedback task, in which they volitionally brought their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and subsequently executed an arm reach.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Furthermore, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks.

**Implications:** These findings establish a population neural basis for slowed movement onset following periods of beta oscillatory activity, supporting the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements (Gilbertson et al., 2005). Our results also add to previously reported findings of elevated beta power prior to and after well-trained movements (Donoghue et al., 1998; Murthy and Fetz, 1992; Sanes and Donoghue, 1993).

**Conclusions:** Our study ties together existing works on behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset through the lens of population-level neural activity. The behavioral effect from neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations matches well with hypotheses claiming a movement-slowing role of beta oscillations during natural movements (Gilbertson et al., 2005). Notably, individual unit responses during beta activity were different across tasks, but population-level analyses show that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both the CO and NR tasks, matching what is observed behaviorally.

    **Title:** TRAF2 Regulates Keratinocyte Homeostasis and Prevents Psoriasis-like Skin Inflammation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of TRAF2 in regulating keratinocyte homeostasis and preventing psoriasis-like skin inflammation?

    **Methods:** To investigate the role of TRAF2 in keratinocytes, we generated mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2 (Traf2EKO) and compared them to mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of Sphk1 (Sphk1-/-). We also examined the effects of concomitant deletion of Tnf and Nfkb2 genes in Traf2EKO mice.

    **Main Findings:** Keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2, but not Sphk1 deficiency, disrupted TNF-mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling, leading to epidermal hyperplasia and psoriasis-like skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB, and the adaptive immune system. In contrast, concomitant deletion of Tnf and Nfkb2 genes in Traf2EKO mice reversed the inflammatory phenotype.

    **Implications:** Our results highlight the essential role of TRAF2 in regulating keratinocyte homeostasis and preventing psoriasis-like skin inflammation. TRAF2 protects keratinocytes from cell death and down-regulates inflammatory responses, suggesting that intrinsic defects in keratinocytes can initiate psoriasis-like skin inflammation.

    **Conclusions:** TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes do not require bacterial stimulation to produce TNF, and TNF-induced death sets up a vicious cycle of inflammation. Concomitant deletion of Tnf in mice with Traf2-deficient keratinocytes breaks this cycle and prevents apoptosis of keratinocytes and early onset of the psoriasis-like phenotype. Our findings support the idea that TRAF2 plays a crucial role in regulating keratinocyte homeostasis and preventing psoriasis-like skin inflammation, and suggest that TRAF2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of psoriasis.

    **Title:** Dynamin 1 and 3 are dispensable for bulk endocytosis and SV reformation from bulk endosomes

    **Research Question:** What is the role of dynamin 1 and 3 in the process of bulk endocytosis and synaptic vesicle (SV) reformation from bulk endosomes during intense synaptic activity?

    **Methods:** We used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out (DKO) neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is dramatically impaired, to investigate the mechanisms underlying bulk endocytosis and SV reformation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. Furthermore, the subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin.

    **Implications:** These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and operates during intense synaptic activity. This pathway may play a crucial role in maintaining synaptic function and plasticity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that dynamin 1 and 3 are dispensable for bulk endocytosis and SV reformation from bulk endosomes, challenging the prevailing view that clathrin and dynamin 1/3 are essential for these processes. Instead, our results suggest the existence of a clathrin- and dynamin-independent pathway for SV reformation, which is activated during intense synaptic activity. These findings have important implications for our understanding of synaptic function and plasticity, and highlight the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying SV reformation and recycling.

    **Title:** Identification of Circulating Biomarkers of Glucocorticoid Action in Humans

    **Research Question:** Can we identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action in humans?

    **Methods:** In a randomized, crossover, single-blind study, 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency were admitted to an in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster, both predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. A microRNA (miR-122-5p) was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure (p = 0.009) and replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure (0.01 ≤ p ≤ 0.05).

    **Implications:** These findings construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarkers to measure effects of glucocorticoids, allowing strategies to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of multi-omic analysis to identify circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action in humans. The identification of miR-122-5p as a putative biomarker of glucocorticoid exposure has significant implications for the development of personalized glucocorticoid therapy and the understanding of glucocorticoid-related diseases. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore the functional role of miR-122-5p in glucocorticoid action.

    **Funding:** This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish federal government under the LUA/ALF agreement, the Swedish Endocrinology Association, the Gothenburg Medical Society, the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council, UK, the Chief Scientist Office, UK, the Eva Madura’s Foundation, the Research Foundation of Copenhagen University Hospital, and the Danish Rheumatism Association (NCT02152553).

    **Title:** Dynamics of mTORC1 Activation in Response to Amino Acids Revealed by Live Imaging

    **Research Question:** How do amino acids regulate the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in cells, and what is the role of lysosomes in this process?

    **Methods:** We used live imaging of the mTORC1 component RAPTOR and a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of mTORC1 translocation to lysosomes in response to amino acid addition. We also generated a series of leucine analogues to test their ability to activate mTORC1.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mTORC1 translocates to lysosomes within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaks within 5 minutes. This translocation is temporally coupled with the appearance of fluorescent leucine in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino acid stimulation. We also found that Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity, respectively. Notably, phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids and suggest that lysosomes play a crucial role in this process. The results also highlight the importance of Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase in regulating mTORC1 activity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a dynamic view of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids, revealing a complex interplay between lysosomes, Sestrin2, and the vacuolar ATPase. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the regulation of mTORC1 and its role in cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and autophagy.

    **Title:** Modulating Antigen Uptake and Immune Response through Controlled Glycosylation of Antigens

    **Research Question:** How does the glycosylation profile of antigens influence antigen uptake, intracellular compartmentalization, and the nature and strength of immune responses?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of modifying the model antigen Ovalbumin (OVA) with the glycan structure LewisX (LeX) on its uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) and intracellular routing to specific compartments. We used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of murine MGL on BM-DCs and CD11c+ spDCs, and immunized mice with OVA-LeX or native OVA to assess CD8+ T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that LeX-modification of OVA re-directs it to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1, enhancing CD8+ T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells. In contrast, cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli. LeX modification reduces the required antigen dose 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. Moreover, MGL1-dependent cross-presentation occurs at low antigen dose and independently of TAP-transporters and Cathepsin-S.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses, and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that the glycosylation profile of antigens has a major influence on antigen uptake and intracellular compartmentalization, affecting both antigen presentation and the type and strength of the induced immune response. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of antigen presentation and highlight the potential of controlled glycosylation of antigens as a strategy to enhance immune responses and improve vaccine efficacy.

    Title: Quorum Sensing Regulates Cell-Cell Contact-Dependent Type VI Secretion in Burkholderia thailandensis to Constrain Quorum Sensing Mutants

    Research Question: How does quorum sensing regulate cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion in Burkholderia thailandensis, and what is the role of this regulation in constraining quorum sensing mutants?

    Methods: We investigated the role of quorum sensing in regulating cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion (T6S) in Burkholderia thailandensis using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We generated a quorum-sensing signal receptor mutant (BtaR1) and its parent strain, and examined their interactions in colony cocultures and broth cocultures.

    Main Findings: We found that quorum sensing activates T6S in Burkholderia thailandensis, and that T6S is required to constrain the proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in colony cocultures. However, in broth cocultures, the quorum sensing mutant outcompetes the parent strain, likely due to the metabolic cost associated with quorum sensing gene activation. We also found that the increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus.

    Implications: Our results demonstrate that quorum sensing regulates T6S in Burkholderia thailandensis, and that this regulation serves to police and constrain quorum sensing mutants. This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control, and highlights the importance of cell-cell contact-dependent mechanisms in regulating bacterial behavior.

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that quorum sensing controls T6SS-1-mediated toxicity and immunity genes, allowing QS-competent members of Burkholderia thailandensis colonies to police against QS mutants. This is a form of microbial policing, where QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal-blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of cooperation and conflict in bacterial populations, and highlight the importance of cell-cell contact-dependent mechanisms in regulating bacterial behavior.

    **Title:** Long-Range Coupling within Prefrontal-Hippocampal Networks Emerges Early in Life: Causal Evidence from Optogenetic Manipulation of Glutamatergic Projection Neurons

    **Research Question:** How do glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus contribute to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment in neonatal mice?

    **Methods:** We employed optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations.

    **Implications:** These findings provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral hippocampus, but not dorsal hippocampus, elicits broad band oscillations in the prefrontal cortex of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections. The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from hippocampal CA1 area to prefrontal cortex via direct axonal projections suggest that the hippocampus acts already at neonatal age as a drive for prefrontal activation.

    **Conclusions:** Our data reveal that the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks, with the intermediate/ventral hippocampus playing a more prominent role in driving the oscillatory entrainment of the prefrontal cortex. These findings provide new insights into the cellular substrate of long-range coupling in the developing brain and open new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain. Future studies should investigate how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks.

    **Title:** Dynamic Post-Translational Modification of RNA Polymerase II Coordinates Co-Transcriptional Regulation of Chromatin States and Nascent RNA Processing

    **Research Question:** How do post-translational modifications of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) regulate chromatin states and nascent RNA processing during transcription?

    **Methods:** We employed biochemical and genome-wide approaches to investigate the dynamic post-translational modifications of the CTD of RNAPII, including mono- and di-methylation of lysine-7 (K7me1 and K7me2) and acetylation (K7ac). We generated novel antibodies specific to CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 and analyzed their distribution across the genome.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that K7me1 and K7me2 are present at the earliest stages of transcription, preceding or accompanying Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with productive elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. We observed an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications. Methylation of K7 residues is associated with less productive transcription, while K7 acetylation is most enriched at the highest expressed genes.

    **Conclusions:** The dynamic post-translational modifications of the CTD of RNAPII play a crucial role in coordinating co-transcriptional regulation of chromatin states and nascent RNA processing. The balance between K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels, highlighting the importance of these modifications in regulating transcriptional output. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between post-translational modifications and transcriptional regulation, and have implications for our understanding of gene expression and its dysregulation in disease.

    **Title:** Post-transcriptional regulation of satellite cell quiescence by Tristetraprolin (TTP)

    **Research Question:** How do skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) maintain quiescence in their niche, and what mechanisms are involved in their activation and self-renewal following muscle injury?

    **Methods:** To investigate the mechanisms of satellite cell quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. We found that transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins, including Tristetraprolin (TTP), were among the most significantly changed.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that TTP promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3' untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates TTP, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell-specific knockdown of TTP precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that regulation of mRNAs by TTP is a critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism controlling satellite cell homeostasis. The rapid p38α/β MAPK-dependent phosphorylation (inactivation) of TTP upon SC activation indicates that TTP plays a role in maintaining SC quiescence. Furthermore, TTP inactivation preceding MyoD up-regulation is consistent with the hypothesis that TTP actively suppresses pro-myogenic mRNA targets.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of satellite cell quiescence by TTP. We propose that TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence, and that loss of TTP from skeletal muscle tissue should precociously activate SCs, promoting inappropriate MyoD expression and aberrant cell cycle entry. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis and muscle regeneration, and highlight the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle diseases.

    **Title:** Macrophage-Intrinsic Interleukin 10 Receptor Signaling Prevents Infantile-Onset Colitis in Mice

    **Research Question:** Does interleukin 10 receptor (IL10R) signaling regulate lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice, and is macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling required to prevent colitis in infancy?

    **Methods:** We performed time-series experiments using IL10R-deficient infant mice and their littermate controls, evaluating histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the lamina propria (LP), and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age. We also used clodronate depletion to investigate the role of colonic macrophages (MΦs) in colonic inflammation that develops in infant IL10R-deficient mice.

    **Main Findings:** Although signs of colitis were absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction began during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and diversification of the intestinal microbiota. Macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling. The results also indicate that IL10R signaling does not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is essential for preventing the development of infantile-onset colitis in mice. These findings have significant implications for understanding the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in infants and highlight the importance of IL10R signaling in maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis during early life.

    **Title:** Identification of SIMR-1 as a Key Regulator of the piRNA Pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What is the role of SIMR-1 in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, and how does it interact with the mutator complex in the piRNA silencing pathway?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of SIMR-1, a Tudor domain protein, in the piRNA silencing pathway in C. elegans. We analyzed the subcellular localization of SIMR-1 and its interaction with other proteins involved in the piRNA pathway, including the mutator complex.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SIMR-1 acts downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. We found that SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of transposons and other germline genes in C. elegans and highlight the importance of perinuclear condensates in the piRNA silencing pathway. The identification of SIMR-1 as a key regulator of the piRNA pathway has significant implications for our understanding of germline gene regulation and transposon silencing in C. elegans.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in promoting mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying germline gene regulation and transposon silencing in C. elegans.

**Title:** Bistability in Purkinje Neurons of Larval Zebrafish: A Conserved Feature of Cerebellar Function

**Research Question:** Do Purkinje neurons exhibit bistability in vivo in unanesthetized larval zebrafish, and if so, what are the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We recorded intracellularly from Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) from 4 to 19 days post-fertilization (dpf) to investigate the membrane potential dynamics of these neurons in vivo.

**Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Purkinje neurons in larval zebrafish exhibit bistability, characterized by tonic firing at depolarized membrane potentials and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. This bistability is dependent on AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated inputs from climbing fibers (CFs). We also show that the initiation of motor neuron spiking is correlated with increased incidence of CF excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and membrane depolarization. Furthermore, bistability is observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persists at least until late larval stages.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons across species, from fish to mammals. This is supported by the conservation of other structural and functional properties of the cerebellum. The ability of Purkinje neurons to switch between tonic and bursting modes in vivo has important implications for our understanding of cerebellar function and motor control.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first direct evidence of bistability in Purkinje neurons in vivo in an unanesthetized animal model. Our results demonstrate that AMPAR-mediated CF inputs are sufficient to trigger bursts in Purkinje neurons, and that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of cerebellar function and motor control, and highlight the importance of further investigation into the mechanisms underlying bistability in Purkinje neurons.

    **Title:** Force Generation by Actin Assembly Shapes Cellular Membranes: A Multiscale Model of Endocytic Internalization

    **Research Question:** Can a minimal branched actin network generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension?

    **Methods:** We combined a continuum membrane mechanics model with filament-based simulations of actin polymerization coupled to endocytic pit internalization to develop a multiscale model of actin in mammalian endocytosis. We used a newly developed molecule-counting method to determine the number of Arp2/3 complexes (~200) that accumulate at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites over time.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to create sustained internalization of an endocytic pit against physiological membrane tension. Actin filament self-organization and bending, which arise from the spatial distribution of actin-coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit, allow the actin network to adapt to changing loads. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit, storing elastic energy that contributes to endocytic internalization.

    **Implications:** Elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. Our findings suggest that spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that a minimal actin network composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein, with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements, is able to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. Our multiscale model provides a mechanistic understanding of how actin assembly shapes cellular membranes during endocytosis, highlighting the importance of actin filament self-organization and bending in generating force for endocytic internalization.

    **Title:** Self-Organizing Signaling Patches Drive Macropinocytic Cup Formation in Dictyostelium

    **Research Question:** How do macropinocytic cups form in Dictyostelium cells, and what is the role of signaling molecules in this process?

    **Methods:** We used lattice light sheet microscopy to examine the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators, such as SCAR and WASP, with respect to signaling molecules, including PIP3 and active Ras, in Dictyostelium cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that macropinocytic cups in Dictyostelium are organized around intense patches of PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac. These signaling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones, and the F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signaling molecules.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of macropinocytosis, a fundamental cellular process that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles. The self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3 play a crucial role in driving macropinocytic cup formation, and the recruitment of a ring of actin nucleators to the periphery of these patches is essential for the extension of the macropinocytic cup.

    **Conclusions:** Our study proposes a new and general hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane, highlighting the importance of self-organizing signaling patches in driving macropinocytic cup formation. These findings have implications for our understanding of macropinocytosis in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells, and may provide new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies to modulate this process.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Insights into the Scc2/Scc4 Complex: A Molecular Basis for Cohesin Loading and Localization

    **Research Question:** How does the Scc2/Scc4 complex initiate sister chromatid cohesion by loading cohesin onto DNA and determining its localization across the genome?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the Scc4 protein in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2. We also used budding yeast as a model organism to investigate the role of Scc4 in recruiting Scc2/4 to centromeres and building pericentromeric cohesion.

    **Main Findings:** Our crystal structure reveals that Scc4 forms a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. We demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is essential for recruiting Scc2/4 to centromeres and building pericentromeric cohesion. Mutations in this conserved patch (scc4m35 or scc4m7) eliminate centromeric localization of Scc2 and reduce association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres and establish a general feature of the control of cohesin loading in eukaryotes. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and defects in this process can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, resulting in severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms.

    **Conclusions:** The Scc2/Scc4 complex plays a crucial role in initiating sister chromatid cohesion by loading cohesin onto DNA and determining its localization across the genome. The conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is essential for recruiting Scc2/4 to centromeres and building pericentromeric cohesion. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sister chromatid cohesion and have important implications for understanding the regulation of cell division in eukaryotes.

    **Title:** Growth, Fattening, and Hibernation Patterns in Early-Born and Late-Born Garden Dormice (Eliomys quercinus)

    **Research Question:** How do early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juvenile garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) differ in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity?

    **Methods:** We investigated the growth, fattening, and hibernation patterns of EB and LB juvenile garden dormice in a controlled laboratory setting. We manipulated food availability (ad-libitum vs. intermittently fasted) to examine its effects on growth, fattening, and hibernation patterns.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals, but reached lower fat content prior to hibernation. Torpor use was low during intensive growth, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB individuals showed higher torpor use, similar body sizes, but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. During hibernation, LB individuals showed similar patterns, but a higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that torpor is incompatible with growth, but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibernation fat depots. Being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history in garden dormice.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the growth, fattening, and hibernation patterns of garden dormice. Our results support the hypothesis that LB juveniles grow and fatten at higher rates, use torpor more extensively, and reach similar pre-hibernation body sizes but lower fat content than EB individuals. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the life history strategies of garden dormice and highlight the importance of torpor in promoting fattening and consolidating pre-hibernation fat reserves.

    Title: Elucidating the Neural Gene Regulatory Role of ADR-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans

    Research Question: What are the neural gene regulatory targets of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in Caenorhabditis elegans, and how do they contribute to the chemosensory defects observed in ADR-2 deficient worms?

    Methods: To address this question, we employed an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2 on the neural transcriptome of C. elegans. We developed and implemented the publicly available software, SAILOR, to identify 7361 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome. We then intersected the neural editome with ADR-2 associated gene expression changes to identify critical neural targets.

    Main Findings: Our analysis revealed an edited mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination. Notably, restoring clec-41 expression in ADR-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans ADR-2 are a result of altered neural gene expression rather than recoding events. This is the first study to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2, both in A-to-I editing and in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. Our results demonstrate that ADR-2 plays a critical role in regulating neural gene expression, and that altered expression of specific genes, such as clec-41, contributes to the chemosensory defects observed in ADR-2 deficient worms. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the neurobiological effects of RNA editing in C. elegans and highlight the importance of ADR-2 in maintaining proper neural function.

    Title: Mechanisms of Influenza A Virus-Induced Host Shutoff Revealed by RNA-Sequencing and Ribosome Profiling

    Research Question: How does the Influenza A virus (IAV) induce host shutoff, a common strategy used by viruses to repress cellular mRNA translation and concomitantly allow the efficient translation of viral mRNAs?

    Methods: We employed RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms of IAV-induced host shutoff in infected cells.

    Main Findings: Our results show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. We found that short transcripts, enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, are less affected by IAV infection. Notably, continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is essential for viral propagation.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that IAV-induced host shutoff is a result of viral dominance over the mRNA pool, rather than direct co-opting of the translation machinery. This mechanism allows IAV to selectively translate genes with important housekeeping functions, such as oxidative phosphorylation, while repressing cellular mRNA translation.

    Conclusions: Our study advances our understanding of IAV-induced host shutoff and reveals a novel mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes essential for viral propagation. These findings have significant implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting IAV-induced host shutoff mechanisms. Our results also highlight the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in IAV infection and suggest that targeting this process may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention. Overall, this study provides new insights into the complex interactions between IAV and host cells, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying IAV-induced host shutoff.

    **Title:** Self-Generated Signaling Gradients through Cytoneme-Mediated Feedback Regulation: A Novel Mechanism of Tissue Morphogenesis

    **Research Question:** How do local cell-to-cell communication mechanisms create long-range signal gradients to regulate tissue morphogenesis?

    **Methods:** We investigated the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila. We characterized the movement of FGF from the larval wing imaginal-disc to the air-sac-primordium (ASP) through FGFR-containing cytonemes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the ASP through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the ASP, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion. This mechanism provides precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that local cell-to-cell communication through cytonemes can create long-range signal gradients to regulate tissue morphogenesis. The feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion by transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut allows for the self-generation of precise tissue-specific gradient contours. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of tissue morphogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

    **Title:** Unexpected Formation of a Novel α/β Coiled Coil Structure through Minor Mutations to a Known Fold

    **Research Question:** How do insertions of two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil affect the backbone structure of the protein?

    **Methods:** Using parametric equations to describe the backbone structure of coiled coils, we inserted two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil and analyzed the resulting structures.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the insertion of two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil strains the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands. These β-strands move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis, resulting in the formation of a novel α/β coiled coil structure. This structure retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold. This has significant implications for protein design efforts, as it suggests that even small changes to a protein structure can lead to the formation of new and unexpected structures.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of the α/β coiled coil structure expands our understanding of coiled coil periodicities and highlights the importance of considering the effects of insertions on protein structure. The α/β coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber based on a novel supersecondary structure element, characterized by alternating α- and β-layers. This finding opens up new avenues for protein design and engineering, and highlights the complexity and diversity of protein structures that can arise from minor mutations to a known fold.

    Title: Elucidating the Evolutionarily Conserved Function of Epsin in Clathrin Coat Dynamics

    Research Question: What is the critical function of epsin in clathrin coat dynamics, and how does it contribute to clathrin-mediated endocytosis?

    Methods: We generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect and a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, characterized by an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits.

    Main Findings: Our results indicate that epsin plays a crucial role in generating the force that leads to invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits. We observed a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton in epsin TKO cells, which was confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Furthermore, we found a weak interaction between epsin's ENTH domain and the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2, suggesting that epsin is involved in the incorporation of SNAREs in the bud.

    Implications: Our study provides conclusive evidence that epsin is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, particularly at the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits. This finding highlights the importance of epsin in the regulation of clathrin coat dynamics and its role in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to the actin cytoskeleton.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that epsin's most critical function is to generate the force that leads to invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits, which is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying endocytosis and highlights the importance of epsin as a key regulator of clathrin coat dynamics. Our study provides new insights into the evolutionarily conserved function of epsin and its role in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Title: Investigating the Risk Factors for Asthma among Schoolchildren in Urban Uganda: A Case-Control Study

    Abstract:

    Background: Asthma aetiology in Africa remains poorly understood, with limited data on risk factors among schoolchildren. This study aimed to investigate the main risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren (5–17 years) in urban Uganda.

    Methods: We conducted a case-control study among 555 cases and 1115 controls. Asthma was diagnosed by study clinicians. We analyzed the association between asthma and various risk factors, including parental education, area of residence at birth, parental history of asthma, children’s own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking methods.

    Main Findings: Our results show that asthma was strongly associated with a rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status, and urbanicity. Specifically, children born in small towns or cities had an increased risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas (adjusted OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.60–2.92 and 2.79, 95% CI: 1.79–4.35, respectively). Parental education, particularly tertiary education, was also a significant risk factor (adjusted OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.71–3.16 for fathers and 1.85, 95% CI: 1.38–2.48 for mothers). Additionally, children’s own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking on gas/electricity were associated with an increased risk of asthma.

    Implications: This study highlights the importance of early life environmental and lifestyle factors in the development of asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda. The rapid urbanization in Africa and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is likely to increase the prevalence of asthma. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to investigate specific environmental and lifestyle factors contributing to asthma risk in urban areas of LMICs.

    Conclusions: This case-control study demonstrates that asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status, and urbanicity. Our results underscore the need for further research to identify specific environmental and lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas of LMICs.

    **Title:** Heteromeric Gap Junctions Formed by Connexin 41.8 and Connexin 39.4 are Required for Stripe Pattern Formation in Zebrafish

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular nature of the interactions between pigment cell types that form the stripe pattern of adult zebrafish?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to investigate the role of Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8) and Connexin 39.4 (Cx39.4) in stripe pattern formation in zebrafish. We identified a new dominant allele, leotK3, which leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. We performed a genetic screen to identify this component and found that Cx39.4 is required for stripe formation in zebrafish.

    **Main Findings:** Double mutants and chimeras showed that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggesting that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these channels promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and instruct the patterning of the iridophores.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that heteromeric gap junctions formed by Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 play a crucial role in stripe pattern formation in zebrafish. These channels are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular nature of the interactions between pigment cell types that form the stripe pattern of adult zebrafish. The identification of Cx39.4 as a component of heteromeric gap junctions with Cx41.8 sheds light on the complex mechanisms underlying pigment pattern formation in zebrafish. These findings have implications for our understanding of the development and evolution of pigment patterns in vertebrates.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Origins of Olfactory Receptors in Insects: A Comparative Study of Apterogote and Neopteran Insects

    **Research Question:** What is the evolutionary history of olfactory receptors in insects, and how did they adapt to terrestrial environments?

    **Methods:** We investigated the olfactory systems of three insect species: Lepismachilis y-signata (Archaeognatha), Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and Phyllium siccifolium (Phasmatodea). We used molecular biology techniques to identify and characterize olfactory receptors (ORs) and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) in these species.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Lepismachilis lacks ORs and Orco, while Thermobia has three Orco candidates, and Phyllium has a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. These findings suggest that ORs did not evolve as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but rather emerged later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of the insect olfactory system and challenges the hypothesis that ORs arose as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. Instead, our results suggest that ORs evolved after the emergence of wings, and that Orco was present before the appearance of ORs. This has significant implications for our understanding of the evolutionary history of insect olfaction.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the evolution of the insect olfactory system is more complex than previously thought. The presence of Orco before the appearance of ORs suggests that Orco played a key role in the evolution of the insect olfactory system. Our findings also highlight the importance of studying basal insects to understand the evolution of olfaction in insects and other animals. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the evolutionary history of the insect olfactory system and its adaptations to terrestrial environments.
Title: Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Malaria Episodes and Asymptomatic Infections in Myanmar: Evidence for a Herd Effect in Mass Drug Administration

    Abstract:

    Background: Malaria elimination efforts are hindered by asymptomatic infections, which are not diagnosed or treated. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been proposed as a solution, but its effectiveness depends on adequate population participation. We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar.

    Methods: We conducted a detailed analysis of micro-epidemiological and spatial data from an MDA trial in Kayin State, Myanmar. We examined the associations between individual- and group-level participation in MDA, subclinical infections, and clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum post-MDA.

    Main Findings: Our results show that individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA compared to those from high adherence neighborhoods, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone else with malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.

    Implications: Our study provides evidence for a herd effect conferred by MDA for P. falciparum malaria, which has important implications for malaria elimination efforts. The findings suggest that MDA can provide additional levels of population protection beyond individual participation. However, spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA can undermine the effectiveness of MDA, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve adherence.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first empirical evidence for a herd effect in MDA for P. falciparum malaria. The results have significant implications for malaria elimination efforts and highlight the importance of addressing spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the herd effect and to develop effective strategies to improve MDA adherence and ultimately achieve malaria elimination.
Title: Conservation and Divergence of Transcription Factor Binding Specificities in Drosophila and Mammals: Implications for Evolution of Novel Cell Types

    Abstract:

    Background: The evolution of divergent morphology in species has been attributed to genetic differences in tissue-specific expression of proteins, which can arise from divergence in cis-regulatory elements or altered binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). However, the relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess.

    Research Question: What is the extent of conservation and divergence of TF binding specificities between Drosophila and mammals, and how do these differences contribute to the emergence of novel cell types?

    Methods: We used high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX) to determine the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs and compared them to human and mouse data.

    Main Findings: Our analysis revealed a striking level of conservation of TF binding specificity between Drosophila and mammals, with almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding for orthologous TFs. However, a few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that subtle changes in these specificities can lead to the emergence of novel cell types. This has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of animal diversity and the development of novel cell types.

    Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of TF binding specificities in Drosophila and sheds light on the evolution of novel cell types. The conservation of TF binding specificities between Drosophila and mammals highlights the importance of these specificities in maintaining cellular identity and function. Our findings also suggest that subtle changes in TF binding specificities can lead to the emergence of novel cell types, providing new insights into the evolution of animal diversity.
Title: Simultaneous Induction of Cardiac and Pulmonary Lineages from Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells via Temporal Tuning of WNT and Nodal Signaling

    Abstract:
    During human embryogenesis, the developing heart and lung engage in extensive crosstalk to ensure proper morphogenesis and maturation. However, a lack of models investigating this critical cardio-pulmonary interaction has hindered our understanding of this process. Here, we report a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary lineages from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via temporal-specific tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (μTs) and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage μT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. Our multilineage differentiation model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.

    Research Question:
    Can human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) be directed to simultaneously differentiate into cardiac and pulmonary lineages via temporal-specific tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling?

    Methods:
    We employed a stepwise strategy to induce cardiac and pulmonary lineages from hiPSCs using small molecule cocktails modulating WNT, Nodal, and TGF-β signaling in a temporal-specific manner. 3D suspension culture was used to establish concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (μTs).

    Main Findings:
    We demonstrated the simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary lineages from hiPSCs via temporal-specific tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling. In 3D suspension culture, each cardio-pulmonary μT effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs, which was partially inhibited by WNT activation. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, each concentric cardio-pulmonary μT reorganized and ultimately segregated into cardiac-only and pulmonary-only μTs.

    Implications:
    Our multilineage differentiation model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis. This model has the potential to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary lineages from hiPSCs via temporal-specific tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling. Our multilineage differentiation model offers a powerful tool for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis, and has the potential to shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development.

    **Title:** Unexpected Flexibility in Cellular Mutation Rates as a Response to Changes in Selective Pressure

    **Research Question:** How do organisms regulate their mutation rates in response to changes in selective pressure, particularly under near-lethal stress conditions?

    **Methods:** We employed a model system of Escherichia coli (E. coli) exposed to high ethanol stress to investigate the dynamics of mutation rate evolution. We used a defined collection of mutators with distinct mutation rates to identify the range of optimal mutation rates for rapid growth under high ethanol stress. Experimental evolution revealed the essential role of hypermutation in de novo adaptation to high ethanol stress.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates as a response to changes in selective pressure. We show that hypermutation independently evolves when E. coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress, and that hypermutator states are transitory, repeatedly alternating with decreases in mutation rate. Specifically, population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline again once cells are adapted. We identified cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of mutation rate evolution and help explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. Our results suggest that organisms balance robustness and evolvability by regulating their mutation rates in response to changes in selective pressure.

    **Conclusions:** While an organism's mutation rate is generally considered a slowly-evolving parameter, our study reveals an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates that matches changes in selective pressure to avoid extinction under near-lethal stress. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the evolution of mutation rates and highlight the importance of cellular mortality in driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of antibiotic resistance and cancer relapse.

    **Title:** The Arabidopsis Transcription Factor bZIP63 as a Direct Target of the SnRK1 Kinase in the Transcriptional Energy Deprivation Response

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 in the transcriptional energy deprivation response, and how is it regulated by the SnRK1 kinase?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of bZIP63 in Arabidopsis thaliana. We generated a bzip63 knock-out mutant and complemented it with wild-type bZIP63 and a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites. We also overexpressed bZIP63-GFP or -YFP in the wild-type and akin10 backgrounds to verify the role of SnRK1 in bZIP63 phosphorylation.

    **Main Findings:** We identified bZIP63 as a key regulator of the starvation response in Arabidopsis and found that it is a direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. The bzip63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild-type bZIP63 but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites. We also found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that bZIP63 plays a crucial role in the transcriptional energy deprivation response in Arabidopsis and that its phosphorylation by SnRK1 is essential for its function. We propose a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of the transcriptional energy deprivation response in plants and highlights the importance of bZIP63 as a key regulator of primary metabolism under stress/starvation conditions. The identification of SnRK1 as a major kinase responsible for bZIP63 phosphorylation opens up new avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic adjustment to changing environmental conditions.

    **Title:** RNF10: A Novel Synaptonuclear Protein Messenger Linking Synaptic Activity to Nuclear Gene Expression

    **Research Question:** What is the role of RNF10 in bidirectional communication between synapses and the nucleus, and how does it contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) and structural modifications of dendritic spines?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology techniques to investigate the role of RNF10 in synaptonuclear communication. Immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitation were used to examine the subcellular localization and interactions of RNF10 with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs).

    **Main Findings:** We identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger that is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at excitatory synapses, where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs. Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of LTP lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus via importin-dependent long-distance transport. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP and LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence for a novel synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathway that specifically links activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs to nuclear gene expression. This pathway is essential for the long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines and the induction of LTP.

    **Conclusions:** RNF10 is a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger that plays a critical role in bidirectional communication between synapses and the nucleus. Its activation by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and subsequent translocation to the nucleus via importin-dependent transport enables the encoding and transduction of synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B NMDAR signals to the nucleus. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of synaptic plasticity and the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into Swi2/Snf2 ATPase-Mediated DNA Remodeling: A Pseudoatomic View of Mot1 in Complex with TBP, DNA, and NC2

    **Research Question:** How do Swi2/Snf2 ATPases, such as Mot1, remodel protein-DNA complexes to control DNA-associated processes?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies to determine the structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TATA box-binding protein (TBP), DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2) at 3.8 Å resolution.

    **Main Findings:** Our data reveal that Mot1 reduces DNA-NC2 interactions and unbends DNA compared to the TBP-DNA-NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP-NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking studies suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a structural framework for understanding how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA-protein complex. The association of Mot1 with the TBP-DNA-NC2 complex results in conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA-protein substrate complex, shedding light on the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Our results suggest that Mot1 primes TBP-NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner, and the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. These findings contribute to our understanding of how Swi2/Snf2 ATPases regulate the structure and epigenetic state of chromatin regions during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mode of Action of Cytotoxic Cyclic Peptides: Targeting the Eukaryotic Elongation Factor-1A Ternary Complex

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular target of the cytotoxic natural product ternatin, and how do its synthetic variants interact with this target to inhibit cellular processes?

    **Methods:** We designed and synthesized structural variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product, and evaluated their potency against cancer cells. Using a photo-affinity probe, we identified the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA) as a specific target of ternatin and its variants. We further demonstrated competitive binding of unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin, to the eEF1A ternary complex.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ternatin and its variants inhibit cellular protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation. Photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products. This finding has significant implications for the development of new cancer therapies and highlights the potential of cyclic peptides as leads for medicinal chemistry efforts.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that the eEF1A ternary complex is a specific target of ternatin and its variants, and that mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mode of action of cytotoxic cyclic peptides and highlights the importance of the eEF1A ternary complex as a target for the development of new cancer therapies.

    **Title:** Loss of OCRL Function Disrupts Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis in Lowe Syndrome Patient Fibroblasts

    **Research Question:** What is the role of OCRL in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and how do mutations in OCRL contribute to the pathology of Lowe syndrome?

    **Methods:** We investigated the impact of OCRL loss on clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts using time-lapse microscopy, immunofluorescence, and biochemical assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics, leading to an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits. These vesicles fail to lose their coat, resulting in the formation of numerous actin comets. We also found that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor, facilitating the recycling of endocytic factors required for the normal progression of endocytosis. The loss of OCRL function in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts disrupts clathrin-mediated endocytosis, contributing to the pathology of the disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role of OCRL in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and highlights the importance of uncoating in the endocytic pathway. Our findings suggest that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis are a key contributor to the pathology of Lowe syndrome, and that the loss of OCRL function is a critical factor in this process. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Lowe syndrome and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.
Title: Identification of a Novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin Regulatory Axis in Intestinal Tumorigenesis

    Abstract:
    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a hallmark of this disease. Despite the importance of this pathway in CRC, the development of effective Wnt inhibitors remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory axis that plays a crucial role in intestinal tumorigenesis. Our study reveals that FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas of APCmin/+ mice and human CRC tissues, function redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216, leading to β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 using PF-562271 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice, accompanied by reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin. These findings indicate that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and identifies a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory axis in intestinal tumorigenesis?

    Methods:
    We used APCmin/+ mice, a genetic model predisposed to the formation of intestinal adenomas due to aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 using PF-562271 on adenoma formation and intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin.

    Main Findings:
    Our study reveals that FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas of APCmin/+ mice and human CRC tissues, function redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216, leading to β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 using PF-562271 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice, accompanied by reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin.

    Implications:
    Our findings indicate that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. This study provides new insights into the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and identifies a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.

    **Title:** Disengagement of Vestibular Balance Stabilizing Mechanisms during Motor State Transitions in Humans

    **Research Question:** Do humans interrupt vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, as predicted by optimal feedback theory?

    **Methods:** We investigated the continuity of vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures in healthy subjects. Participants initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses.

    **Main Findings:** Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results suggest that humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states.

    **Implications:** Our findings support the optimal feedback theory, which proposes that transitions between motor states require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement initiation starts while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, indicating a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that humans "stop balancing" before they start moving and "stop moving" before they start balancing again. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. This study provides new insights into the neural control of motor state transitions and has implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying balance control in humans. The findings suggest that the vestibular system plays a critical role in regulating balance during transitions between motor states, and that the disengagement of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states.

    **Title:** Circadian Regulation of Carbon Metabolism in Cyanobacteria: A Critical Role for RpaA in Anticipating Periodic Energy Limitations

    **Research Question:** How does the circadian output pathway, mediated by the transcription factor RpaA, control and temporally coordinate essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cyanobacteria facing periodic energy limitations?

    **Methods:** We investigated the mechanisms underlying the viability defect of a cyanobacterial strain deleted for the rpaA gene, which encodes the master regulator of circadian transcription. We analyzed the effects of rpaA deletion on energy status, carbon reserve accumulation, and transcription of genes crucial for carbohydrate utilization at night.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment. We demonstrate that functional circadian output mediated by RpaA is required for the anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day, as well as metabolic switching to carbon catabolism at dusk.

    **Conclusions:** Our results strongly suggest that RpaA plays a critical role in coordinating carbon anabolism and catabolism to prepare cells for the metabolic demands of periods of darkness. The deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy charge and reduced fitness. Our data support a model in which anticipation of periodic dark-induced resource limitation is one essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Insights into the PIB-4-ATPase sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1

    **Research Question:** What is the structure and mechanism of the PIB-4-ATPase sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1, and how does it transport heavy metals across cellular membranes?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays to determine the structure and function of the PIB-4-ATPase sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. We used the Baginski assay to assess the ATPase activity of sCoaT in vitro in the presence of various heavy metals.

    **Main Findings:** We present the first structure of a PIB-4-type ATPase, revealing an eight-helix M-domain configuration and the absence of classical heavy-metal-binding domains (HMBDs). Our results also show that sCoaT has a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. Furthermore, we found that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium-independent, contrasting with many other P-type ATPases.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters and shed light on the topology of PIB-4-ATPases. The absence of HMBDs in sCoaT suggests that PIB-4-ATPases may use alternative mechanisms to bind and transport heavy metals. Our results also have implications for drug discovery, as PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** The structure and function of the PIB-4-ATPase sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1 reveal a novel mechanism of heavy-metal transport that is distinct from other P-type ATPases. Our findings open up new avenues for the development of tools to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants and provide promising leads for drug-discovery efforts to combat pathogens that rely on PIB-4-ATPases for virulence.

    Title: Identification of a Chromatin Signature for Mitotically Stable Monoallelic Expression (MAE) in Human Cells

    Background: Mitotically stable monoallelic expression (MAE) is a phenomenon where a single allele of an autosomal gene is expressed in a cell, while the other allele is silenced. Despite its importance in various human diseases, the regulation of MAE remains poorly understood due to its clonal nature.

    Research Question: Can we identify a chromatin signature that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells and sheds light on its regulation?

    Methods: We developed a novel approach to detect MAE genes by analyzing chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. We applied this approach to a variety of cell types and estimated that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE.

    Main Findings: Our results reveal that the MAE signature is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Notably, we found that a remarkably large fraction of known bivalent genes (>80%) acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types. This suggests that upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature.

    Implications: Our findings open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, making it feasible to analyze MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. This has significant implications for understanding the regulation of MAE and its role in human diseases.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies a chromatin signature that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells, providing new insights into the regulation of this phenomenon. The MAE signature is linked to cell differentiation and is enriched among key developmental genes. These findings have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MAE and its role in human diseases.

    **Title:** Coiled-Coil Middle Domains Regulate AAA+ Chaperone Activity in Bacteria

    **Research Question:** How do coiled-coil middle domains (MDs) control the activity of AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpC, in bacteria?

    **Methods:** We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of ClpC with and without the adaptor protein MecA. We also generated MD mutants of ClpC and ClpE to investigate the role of MDs in regulating AAA+ chaperone activity.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil MDs, which sequester ClpC molecules in an inactive resting state. MecA binding to MD interaction sites converts this resting state to an active planar ring structure, stimulating ClpC ATPase activity. Loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity in bacteria. This mechanism is distinct from other AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpB/Hsp104, where MDs form a repressing belt around the AAA ring. Our results suggest that coiled-coil MDs are a general mechanism for controlling bacterial AAA+ chaperone systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of AAA+ chaperones in bacteria and highlights the importance of coiled-coil MDs in controlling their activity. The severe toxicity of ClpC and ClpE MD mutants suggests that these AAA+ chaperones are potential targets for antimicrobial therapies. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of bacterial stress resistance and virulence, and for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.

    **Title:** Niche-Driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc Cascade Regulates the Reactivation of Adult Muscle Precursors in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** How do adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells, maintain their non-differentiated quiescent state and how are they reactivated during development?

    **Methods:** We employed a Drosophila model to investigate the in vivo behavior of AMPs, focusing on their interactions with neighboring muscles. We used genetic analyses to examine the role of muscles in AMP reactivation and proliferation.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. We found that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs, leading to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Notably, dMyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation, indicating that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that muscles behave as an AMP niche, providing local inductive Insulin signals that reactivate AMPs and induce their proliferation in larval stages. The Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs, highlighting the importance of the muscle niche in regulating muscle stem cell behavior.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing the reactivation of adult muscle precursors in Drosophila. Our results demonstrate that the muscle niche plays a driving role in AMP reactivation and proliferation, and that the Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade is a key regulatory pathway in this process. These findings have implications for our understanding of muscle stem cell biology and muscle regeneration in both Drosophila and vertebrates.

    **Title:** Identification of the Sodium Leak Channel NALCN as a Critical Regulator of Tonic Firing in Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata Neurons

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of the depolarizing leak current that supports the spontaneous firing of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons, and how does it contribute to basal ganglia circuit function?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons and identified the sodium leak channel NALCN as the highest expressed nonselective cation channel (NSCC) in these cells.

    **Main Findings:** We found that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing, suggesting that NALCN is essential for the maintenance of tonic activity in these neurons. Furthermore, we discovered that NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits observed in humans carrying mutations in NALCN. The identification of NALCN as a critical regulator of SNr neuron firing provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying basal ganglia function and dysfunction.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that NALCN is the molecular basis of the depolarizing leak current that supports the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons. The expression of NALCN in SNr neurons is essential for the maintenance of tonic activity, and its disruption may contribute to basal ganglia-related motor disorders. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying basal ganglia function and dysfunction, and highlight the potential of NALCN as a therapeutic target for the treatment of motor disorders associated with basal ganglia dysfunction.

    **Title:** Microfluidic Droplet-Based Cultivation and High-Throughput Screening for the Discovery of Novel Antibiotics

    **Research Question:** Can a microfluidic droplet-based cultivation system be used to increase the throughput and sensitivity of microbiological cultivation, allowing for the discovery of novel antibiotics from uncultured microorganisms?

    **Methods:** We developed a droplet-based microscale cultivation system coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. The system consisted of a modular droplet-microfluidic platform that mimicked environmental conditions in situ. A miniaturized droplet volume of 200 pL facilitated high-density long-term cultivation of 2 million compartmentalized single cells in a total volume of 1.5 mL. Reporter strains were added to the cultivation compartments to screen for antibiotic production.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrated that highly parallelized in-droplet cultivation starting from single cells resulted in the cultivation of yet uncultured species and a significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. Strains able to inhibit intact reporter strains were isolated from the system, and a variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected for a selected potent antibiotic producer.

    **Implications:** The combination of bacterial strain discovery during the in-droplet cultivation phase with subsequent selection of the most auspicious candidates for natural product biosynthesis through a highly robust reporter assay will streamline efforts towards new scaffold structures for the development of antibiotics.

    **Conclusions:** Our microfluidic droplet-based cultivation system has the potential to revolutionize the discovery of novel antibiotics by increasing the throughput and sensitivity of microbiological cultivation. The ability to culture uncultured microorganisms and detect antimicrobial compounds in a high-throughput manner will accelerate the development of new antibiotics to combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the system provides a genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, allowing for the identification and characterization of novel antimicrobial compounds.

    **Title:** Genotype-Directed Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy for Tuberculous Meningitis: A Bayesian Analysis of LTA4H Genotype and Disease Severity

    **Background:** Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a devastating disease with high mortality rates, despite adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reducing mortality by only 30%. Recent studies have suggested that the LTA4H TT genotype, which regulates inflammatory eicosanoids, may be a critical determinant of inflammation and response to corticosteroid treatment.

    **Research Question:** Does the LTA4H TT genotype confer a survival benefit in patients with TBM, and is this benefit influenced by disease severity?

    **Methods:** We conducted a Bayesian analysis of two studies, one from Vietnam and one from Indonesia, to investigate the association between LTA4H genotype and survival in patients with TBM.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the LTA4H TT genotype confers a survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. However, this benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that LTA4H genotyping, combined with disease severity assessment, may be used to target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it. This personalized approach may improve treatment outcomes for patients with TBM.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the LTA4H TT genotype is a critical determinant of inflammation and response to corticosteroid treatment in TBM. The nullification of the LTA4H genotype benefit in severe cases may be due to the overriding effect of disease severity, rather than an unknown genetic phenomenon. These findings have important implications for the development of genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy for TBM.

    **Title:** Spatially Regulated Phosphorylation of Shootin1 Mediates Netrin-1 Gradient-Induced Axon Guidance

    **Research Question:** How do growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues, and what is the molecular mechanism underlying the transduction of local spatial cues into protrusive forces?

    **Methods:** We used knockout mice of Shootin1 and Netrin-1 to investigate the role of Shootin1 in axon guidance. We examined the expression of Shootin1 in developing forebrain commissural axons and its interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM. We also analyzed the effects of Shootin1 phosphorylation on F-actin-adhesion coupling and growth cone migration.

    **Main Findings:** We found that knockout mice of Shootin1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of Netrin-1 knockout mice. Shallow gradients of Netrin-1 elicited highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of Shootin1 within growth cones. This phosphorylation increased the interaction between Shootin1 and L1-CAM, promoting F-actin-adhesion coupling and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Moreover, spatially regulated Shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by Netrin-1 gradients.

    **Implications:** Our study defines a mechano-effector for Netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that Shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for Netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance. The spatially regulated phosphorylation of Shootin1 within growth cones mediates the gradient reading and mechanoresponse for Netrin-1-induced axon guidance.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of axon guidance and the role of Shootin1 in transducing local spatial cues into protrusive forces. The spatially regulated phosphorylation of Shootin1 within growth cones is essential for axon turning induced by Netrin-1 gradients, and its interaction with L1-CAM promotes F-actin-adhesion coupling and growth cone migration. These results have significant implications for our understanding of axon guidance and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Biophysical Origin of Hummingbird Hum: A Multidisciplinary Approach

    **Research Question:** What is the biophysical origin of the humming sound produced by hummingbirds, and how do oscillating aerodynamic forces contribute to this phenomenon?

    **Methods:** We conducted an in vivo study on six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds using a 2176 microphone array for acoustic nearfield holography and a new aerodynamic force platform to directly measure 3D aerodynamic forces. We also developed an idealized acoustic model that integrates wing kinematics and aerodynamic forces to predict the sound radiated by the flapping wings.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the hummingbird’s hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing, which generate higher harmonics that contribute to the characteristic timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings. We found that larger birds are quieter, while elongated flies are louder, due to allometric deviation. Our model analysis across insects and birds clarifies complex bioacoustic behavior.

    **Implications:** This study provides new insights into the biophysical origin of hummingbird hum, shedding light on the role of oscillating aerodynamic forces in generating sound. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of bioacoustic behavior in birds and insects, and may inform the development of novel biomimetic technologies.

    **Conclusions:** Our multidisciplinary approach, combining aerodynamic force platform measurements and acoustic nearfield holography with an idealized acoustic model, provides a comprehensive understanding of the biophysical origin of hummingbird hum. Our results demonstrate that oscillating aerodynamic forces play a crucial role in generating the characteristic sound of flapping wings, and highlight the importance of allometric deviation in shaping bioacoustic behavior. This study contributes to our understanding of the intricate relationships between wing kinematics, aerodynamics, and sound production in birds and insects.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Interplay of Chance, Contingency, and Necessity in Protein Evolution

    **Research Question:** To what extent do chance, contingency, and necessity contribute to the evolution of protein-protein interaction (PPI) specificities in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the BCL-2 family, simulating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins under identical selection pressures.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that, over long historical timescales, contingency steadily erases necessity and overwhelms chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation. We found that trajectories launched from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no common mutations, even under strong and identical selection pressures. Chance arose due to the numerous sets of mutations that could alter specificity at any timepoint, while contingency arose from historical substitutions that changed these sets.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that present-day BCL-2 family proteins, and potentially many others, are largely idiosyncratic products of their particular and unpredictable histories, shaped by the interaction of accumulated chance events during descent from common ancestors with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that contingency plays a profound role in BCL-2 family protein sequence evolution under laboratory selection for new functions. The results indicate that the paths through sequence space leading to historical PPI specificities changed repeatedly during the BCL-2 family's history, even during intervals when the proteins' PPI binding profiles did not evolve. This suggests that chance can strongly influence the outcomes of adaptive evolution only when multiple paths to a selected phenotype are accessible with similar probabilities of being taken. Our study highlights the importance of considering contingency as a primary factor shaping the outcomes of evolution, in addition to selection, drift, and mutation.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complex History of Genetic Diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Haplotype Sharing and Gene-Flow

    **Research Question:** What are the patterns of genetic diversity and gene-flow in sub-Saharan Africa, and how have they been shaped by historical events such as admixture and population expansions?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide, haplotype-based analysis of a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups to characterize the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in the region.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis reveals that coastal populations in sub-Saharan Africa experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, while Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. Furthermore, we found that most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the complex history of genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the importance of admixture and gene-flow in shaping the genetic landscape of the continent. These findings have significant implications for studies of genetic epidemiology, as they provide a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups and identify the dominant events that have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa.

    **Conclusions:** Our in-depth analysis of haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments provides a nuanced understanding of the genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa. These observations are relevant to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa and highlight the importance of considering the complex history of genetic diversity in the region when interpreting genetic data. Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence that admixture and gene-flow have played a significant role in shaping the genetic diversity of human populations across the globe.

    **Title:** Mechanisms of Spindle Scaling during Xenopus laevis Embryogenesis: A Ratiometric Control of Microtubule Destabilization

    **Research Question:** How does the mitotic spindle adapt to changing cell dimensions during early development in Xenopus laevis embryos?

    **Methods:** We established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus laevis embryos to recapitulate in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37 µm) and stage 8 (∼4000 cells, 18 µm). We identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling.

    **Main Findings:** We found that kif2a's microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development.

    **Conclusions:** We have elucidated a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell size during Xenopus laevis development through differential activation of the kinesin-13 kif2a. This work highlights the importance of spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in large cells of early Xenopus development. Our findings suggest that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of spindle scaling during vertebrate embryogenesis.

    **Title:** Discovery of Tandem Guanine-Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate (PRPP) Riboswitch Aptamers Approximating an IMPLY Boolean Logic Gate in Bacteria

    **Research Question:** Can tandem arrangements of ligand-binding riboswitch aptamers approximate the function of specific two-input Boolean logic gates to regulate gene expression in bacteria?

    **Methods:** In this study, we identified and characterized riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) that exist either in singlet arrangements or in tandem with guanine aptamers. We used in-line probing experiments to examine the aptamer regions of the RNA and assessed the logic gate function of the tandem riboswitch through interactions between the two aptamers and the adjoining expression platform.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind target ligands, either independently or in combination, to approximate the function expected for an IMPLY Boolean logic gate. This allows for the regulation of transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria. Our results demonstrate that these tandem riboswitch systems can sense two ancient ribonucleotide derivatives to control synthesis of RNA molecules, supporting the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors.

    **Implications:** The existence of sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems that sense two ancient ribonucleotide derivatives has significant implications for our understanding of the complexity of systems used for metabolite monitoring and biological regulation in ancient RNA World organisms. Furthermore, our findings suggest that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates may be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitches serves as additional demonstrations of how complex molecular devices can be formed purely from RNA. Our results support the idea that RNA aptamers that selectively bound biosynthetic precursors in ancient times might have persisted to serve as riboswitch aptamers in modern cells. This study highlights the potential for RNA to play a central role in the regulation of gene expression and provides new insights into the evolution of complex biological systems.

    **Title:** Regulation of Multivesicular Release by the Readily-Releasable Pool: A Novel Mechanism for Synaptic Diversity

    **Research Question:** What is the source of variability in the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential, and how does this variability contribute to the diversity of synaptic function across brain regions?

    **Methods:** We used mouse brain slices to investigate the regulation of multivesicular release (MVR) and its relationship to the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the RRP, upstream of vesicle release probability. We found that protein kinase A (PKA) and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. This suggests that the RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, which is under the control of synapsins and constrains the number of vesicles released.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control MVR and contribute to the functional diversity of synaptic signaling. Our results suggest that the size of the RRP, rather than vesicle release probability, is a key determinant of the number of vesicles released. This has important implications for understanding synaptic diversity and developing unifying models of presynaptic function that account for multiple presynaptic parameters.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism for regulating MVR, which is distinct from the prevailing view that release mode is determined by vesicle release probability. These findings highlight the importance of the RRP in controlling the number of vesicles released and suggest that synapsin and PKA play a critical role in regulating release site occupancy. Our results provide a new framework for understanding the diversity of synaptic function across brain regions and have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into HIV-1 Genome Selection and Packaging: A Minimal System Approach

    **Research Question:** How does HIV-1 Gag selectively package its dimeric, unspliced viral RNA genome in the presence of a large excess of cytosolic human RNAs?

    **Methods:** We employed a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag, and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag, which subtly affect its self-assembly on membranes, abrogate RNA selectivity. Furthermore, we found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. These findings suggest that the ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are interdependent on one another.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 genome selection and packaging. We propose a model in which a viral RNA with multiple high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA. This model highlights the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA. Lattice contacts conferring Gag's ability to multimerize on a membrane are crucial for the selective packaging of viral RNA. The 5'UTR is recruited to membranes by multimerized Gag without any gross changes to its secondary structure. Moreover, the association of Gag with tRNA serves to inhibit genome-less virus assembly. Overall, our study provides a mechanistic understanding of HIV-1 genome selection and packaging, which has important implications for the development of novel antiretroviral therapies.
