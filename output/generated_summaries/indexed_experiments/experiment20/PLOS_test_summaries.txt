Title: Quantitative Assessment of Gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis (gHAT) Elimination in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A Stochastic Modeling Approach

Abstract:

Background: Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a fatal vector-borne disease that has seen a significant decline in reported cases over the past two decades due to intensified intervention efforts. However, pockets of infection remain, necessitating a quantitative assessment of regional progress towards elimination.

Research Question: Can a stochastic mathematical model capture the dynamics of gHAT at the health area level in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and inform targeted intervention efforts?

Methods: We employed a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to fit a previously developed stochastic gHAT model to case data from 16 health areas in Mosango health zone, Kwilu province, DRC. This approach allowed us to quantify uncertainty in our results and account for stochastic variations in infection dynamics.

Main Findings: Our analysis revealed that the health area of Kinzamba II, which accounts for approximately one-third of the health zone's cases, is predicted to have the latest expected year for elimination of transmission (EoT) under current intervention strategies. Spatial heterogeneity in cases was reflected in the modeling results, highlighting the importance of targeted intervention efforts.

Implications: Our findings suggest that expanding health area fitting to cover more of the DRC should be done using deterministic fits for efficiency, while stochastic projections should be used to capture both parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of fitting a mechanistic, stochastic infection model to health area data in the DRC, providing a new framework for highly detailed calibration and projections of future gHAT infections under various intervention scenarios. Our results underscore the importance of targeted intervention efforts and highlight the need for continued monitoring and evaluation to achieve the ambitious goal of gHAT elimination in the DRC.

    **Title:** Spatial Analysis of Tumor Microenvironments Reveals Predictive Biomarkers for Patient Outcomes in Cancer

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel approach to summarize spatial relationships in tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and predict patient outcomes, such as survival and treatment success, using emerging immunotherapies?

    **Methods:** We propose an approach that combines spatial K functions, functional data analysis, and random forest models to identify important spatial relationships in TMEs and predict patient outcomes. We applied this approach to simulated data and two real datasets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients.

    **Main Findings:** Our approach was effective in identifying important spatial interactions and controlling the false discovery rate in simulated data. In the TNBC dataset, we compared two groups of tumors based on the degree of tumor-immune cell interactions and found significant differences in the distribution of cell phenotypes and protein antigens between the two groups. Using a modified random forest model, we were able to predict patient outcomes, such as survival and treatment success, based on TME and meta-data.

    **Implications:** Our approach has the potential to identify predictive biomarkers for patient outcomes in cancer and guide therapeutic interventions. By analyzing spatial relationships in TMEs, we can identify specific interactions between tumor cells and immune cells that are associated with patient outcomes. This information can be used to develop personalized treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel approach provides a powerful tool for summarizing spatial relationships in TMEs and predicting patient outcomes. By combining spatial K functions, functional data analysis, and random forest models, we can identify important spatial interactions and predict patient outcomes with high accuracy. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of cancer research and improve patient outcomes. The proposed method is publicly available in a companion R package, funkycells, making it accessible to researchers and clinicians.

    **Title:** Investigating the Impact of Plasticity Mechanisms on Neural Network Synchronization and Desynchronization

    **Research Question:** How do different types of plasticity mechanisms, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP), and structural plasticity (SP), affect the synchronization and desynchronization of neural networks?

    **Methods:** We employed a computational model of a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms. We simulated four scenarios: (i) STDP only, (ii) hSP only, (iii) a combination of STDP and hSP, and (iv) a combination of STDP and SP. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduced a simple stochastic SP model.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that structural reorganization can remarkably enhance the network's level of synchrony. Weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, leading to synchrony with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. The strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity.

    **Implications:** Our findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e.g., in Parkinson's disease. We also show that the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model requires stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization compared to models (iii) and (iv).

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the co-emergence of neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure in understanding the impact of plasticity mechanisms on neural network synchronization and desynchronization. The results of this study provide new insights into the complex interactions between neuronal dynamics and synaptic plasticity during transitions to and in steady (de)synchronized states in plastic neuronal networks.

    **Title:** Coordinated Regeneration of Neurons and Glia in Planarians: A Delta-Notch Signaling Mechanism

    **Research Question:** How do planarians regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system, including neurons and glia, from an unlimited number of starting points?

    **Methods:** We investigated the regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches, including gene expression analysis, cell transplantation, and pharmacological inhibition.

    **Main Findings:** We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing the delta-2 gene at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Subsequently, glia are specified from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. Furthermore, loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the associated glia, while transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, providing a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of the numbers and pattern of cell types in the planarian nervous system.

    **Conclusions:** We propose a novel mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, involving a Delta-Notch signaling interaction between neurons and phagocytic progenitors. This mechanism presents an attractive solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, allowing for the evolution of new configurations of glia in the nervous system. Our findings have implications for understanding the development and regeneration of the nervous system in other organisms, and highlight the importance of Delta-Notch signaling in cell-fate specification and tissue patterning throughout the Metazoa.

    **Title:** Early γδ T Cell Responses and Neutralization Breadth in HIV-1 Infection

    **Research Question:** Do γδ T cells play a role in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study of 16 individuals previously characterized for neutralization breadth development, starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI). We analyzed the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells, including Vδ1 and Vδ2 subsets, and their surface marker expression (CD16 and CD57) in relation to viral load and bNAb development.

    **Main Findings:** We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV-1 acquisition and was associated with viral load. Notably, expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells was higher in broad neutralizers during AHI and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. Furthermore, levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells were associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that γδ T cells may promote the development of neutralization breadth, which has significant implications for HIV-1 vaccine strategies. Understanding the mechanisms by which γδ T cells contribute to bNAb development could inform the design of novel vaccine approaches that target these cells to improve humoral immune responses.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role of γδ T cells in the early stages of HIV-1 infection and their potential contribution to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our results highlight the importance of γδ T cells in the initial control of viral replication and the promotion of humoral immune responses, and suggest that targeting these cells may be a promising strategy for improving HIV-1 vaccine efficacy.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Bispecific Antibody BS1 in Inhibiting Cancer Metastasis: A Quantitative Computational Model

    **Research Question:** How does the bispecific antibody BS1, targeting IL-6R and IL-8R, inhibit cancer metastasis, and what are the underlying mechanisms of its binding and inhibition?

    **Methods:** We developed a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 bispecific antibody and performed simulations of monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors.

    **Main Findings:** Our model results demonstrate that the balance of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design. We found that the relative amount of IL-6R and IL-8R expression is critical for bispecific antibody binding, and that a 1:1 ratio of the two receptors results in bispecific antibody binding similar to the combination of anti-IL-6R and anti-IL-8R monospecific antibodies.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the potential of bispecific antibodies, such as BS1, in inhibiting cancer metastasis by targeting the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network. By elucidating the mechanisms of BS1 binding and inhibition, our model provides a framework for optimizing therapeutic design and maximizing the efficacy of new bispecific antibody treatments.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of quantitative computational modeling in understanding the complex interactions between bispecific antibodies and their target receptors. Our results have important implications for the development of novel cancer therapies and highlight the potential of bispecific antibodies in inhibiting cancer metastasis. By providing a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying BS1 binding and inhibition, our model can guide the design of more effective therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

    **Keywords:** Bispecific antibodies, IL-6R, IL-8R, cancer metastasis, computational modeling, therapeutic design.
Title: ZYG-8 Regulates Microtubule Dynamics and Motor-Driven Forces to Stabilize Acentrosomal Spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans Oocytes

    Abstract:
    During acentrosomal spindle assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes, microtubules must be precisely organized to form a stable bipolar structure. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase, in regulating microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the oocyte spindle. Our results show that ZYG-8 depletion leads to overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects, suggesting a critical role for this protein in spindle organization. We found that ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics, facilitating the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle, and influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules, tuning the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZYG-8's kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis. Our findings provide new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division and shed light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles, ultimately stabilizing the bipolar spindle structure.

    Research Question:
    How do microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces contribute to the stabilization of acentrosomal spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes, and what is the role of ZYG-8 in this process?

    Methods:
    We used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete ZYG-8 in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes and examined the effects on spindle organization and microtubule dynamics. We also performed experiments with monopolar spindles to investigate the role of ZYG-8 in regulating motor-driven forces.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that ZYG-8 depletion leads to overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects, suggesting a critical role for this protein in spindle organization. We found that ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics, facilitating the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle, and influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules, tuning the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZYG-8's kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division and shed light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles, ultimately stabilizing the bipolar spindle structure. These results have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying acentrosomal spindle assembly and the regulation of microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our studies have provided new insights into the functions of ZYG-8 in regulating microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the oocyte spindle, and have shed light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles, ultimately stabilizing the bipolar spindle structure. Further experiments will be crucial to understand the various ways that ZYG-8 contributes to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and spindle forces.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Metabolic Consequences of Type 2 Diabetes: A Mendelian Randomization and Interaction Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis

    **Research Question:** What is the extent to which type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects circulating metabolite levels and their genetic regulation?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, comprising 92% lipids and lipoproteins. We integrated these data with large-scale T2D genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Notably, twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Using interaction quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we described four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions showed attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that T2D occurrence has a significant impact on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Furthermore, we identified 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Notably, 40 of these metabolites are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk, underscoring the need for further research into the metabolic consequences of T2D and their implications for disease prevention and treatment.
Title: Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Staphylococcus aureus Tolerance in Mice: Identification of C5ar1 and C5ar2 as Key Genes

    Abstract:
    Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a pathogen that colonizes humans asymptomatically but can cause opportunistic infections, ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two mechanisms by which hosts can survive an infection, with resistance limiting the pathogen burden and tolerance limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. In this study, we aimed to identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection using a collaborative cross (CC) mouse model. We crossed CC061 mice, which are highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection (USA300), with CC024 mice, which are tolerant. Our results show that the F1 and F2 generations exhibit a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype, with 65% and 55% survival rates, respectively. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection, which was associated with the WSB/EiJ allele present in CC024 mice. Further analysis revealed that two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region. These genes are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of S. aureus tolerance and highlight the potential role of C5ar1 and C5ar2 in modulating the immune response to S. aureus infection.

    **Title:** The Impact of Gene Regulatory Networks on Adaptive Evolution: A Quantitative Trait Perspective

    **Research Question:** How do gene regulatory networks influence the availability of beneficial alleles and the tempo and mode of adaptation during an adaptive walk scenario?

    **Methods:** We employed forward-time genetic simulations to model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. We compared the adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to the expectation of an exponential distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations, both models exhibited distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles. The network model displayed a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a significant density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects, which may limit the availability of beneficial alleles and slow down the rate of trait evolution. This has significant implications for our understanding of how populations adapt to changing environments.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of considering gene regulatory networks in models of adaptation, as they can generate complex and non-additive genotype-phenotype relationships. Our findings challenge the classical expectation of an exponential distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations and provide new insights into the role of genetic networks in shaping the tempo and mode of adaptation. The results of this study have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of quantitative traits and the ability of populations to adapt to changing environments. By incorporating gene regulatory networks into adaptive walk theory, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions that drive trait evolution.

    **Supporting Text:** This study combines the biological realism of network modeling with the wealth of existing tools for studies of the evolution of quantitative traits. Our approach allows us to evaluate the shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks, revealing stark differences from classical expectations in some cases. The results of this study provide new insights into the role of genetic networks in shaping the tempo and mode of adaptation and highlight the importance of considering non-additive genotype-phenotype relationships in models of adaptation.

    **Title:** Bayesian Dendritic Integration and Synaptic Plasticity: A Novel Computational Framework for Cortical Circuits

    **Research Question:** How do cortical circuits integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior, and what is the underlying computational mechanism?

    **Methods:** We propose a novel, Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses, which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. Our approach posits that apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances.

    **Main Findings:** We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations.

    **Implications:** Our Bayesian dendritic integration view predicts neuronal response properties that differ from those of classical neuron models. Somatic membrane potentials reflect prior expectations in the absence of sensory input, allowing each dendritic compartment to adjust its relative reliability according to its past success in contributing to matching desired somatic distributions. We also derive somatic membrane potential dynamics and synaptic plasticity jointly via stochastic gradient ascent on the log-posterior distribution of somatic potentials.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel computational framework provides a mechanistic explanation for how cortical circuits integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. We demonstrate that conductance-based neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration, and derive a gradient-based plasticity rule that allows neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity, and provides a new perspective on the biophysics of cortical neurons.

    **Title:** Large-Scale Domain Annotation of Protein Structures from 48 Whole Proteomes Reveals Insights into Eukaryotic and Bacterial Homologous Groups

    **Research Question:** Can large-scale domain annotation of protein structures from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database provide biological insights into eukaryotic and bacterial homologous groups?

    **Methods:** We employed the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) from experimental structures as a basis for classification to detect and catalog domains from 48 whole proteomes. We used the AlphaFold Database, which contains a wide selection of model organisms, including zebrafish, fruit flies, and E. coli.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that we can provide positive classification (either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions) for 90% of residues in all proteomes. We classified 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins comprised of over 226,424,000 amino acid residues. Eukaryotes showed a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, as well as a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats, compared to bacteria. We also identified highly populated domains shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that structural domain classification is still finding domains previously unannotated by sequence domain classifications, particularly among less populated homologous groups. The division of predicted models into easily classified domains, domains with more distant or difficult-to-recognize homology, or regions that are unstructured or have no domains whatsoever will continue to be a useful strategy for grappling with large structural datasets. The widespread access to proteins that were previously difficult or unamenable to structural classification has dramatically diminished the gap between structural and sequence classification.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of large-scale domain annotation of protein structures from 48 whole proteomes to provide biological insights into eukaryotic and bacterial homologous groups. The resulting domains from these proteomes suggested biological insights for their respective organisms and were made available on the ECOD website. Our findings have implications for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets and highlight the importance of structural domain classification in expanding our knowledge of previously unknown domains.

    **Title:** Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Host Cell Cycle Dependence of BK Polyomavirus Replication

    **Background:** BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are no antiviral treatments. Current models suggest that BKPyV expresses TAg (large T antigen) early during infection, promoting cells to enter the S phase, where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery.

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between BKPyV TAg expression and the host cell cycle?

    **Methods:** We performed single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that robust TAg expression requires replication of the host DNA first, and that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase. We also found that BKPyV promotes cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase without passing through mitosis or G1 phase, resulting in cells with greater than 4N DNA content.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest a new model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. This understanding of the molecular events required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV.

    **Conclusions:** Our single-cell analysis reveals that BKPyV depends on the host cell cycle for TAg expression and viral production, contradicting the current model. Instead, our data supports a new model where BKPyV requires an initial host S phase to replicate, aligning with other small DNA tumor viruses such as papilloma- and adenoviruses. Our findings have significant implications for the development of antiviral therapies against BKPyV, a major cause of kidney transplant failure.

    **Title:** FABIO: A Novel Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Fine-Mapping Method for Binary Traits

    **Background:** Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, existing TWAS fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions, leading to potentially suboptimal performance.

    **Research Question:** Can a novel TWAS fine-mapping method, FABIO, specifically designed for binary traits, improve the identification of potentially causal genes by jointly modeling all genes on an entire chromosome?

    **Methods:** FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression (GReX) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome. We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank.

    **Main Findings:** FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27.9%-36.9% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging its improved power, FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension.

    **Implications:** FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits. By jointly modeling all genes on an entire chromosome, FABIO captures GReX correlations that are not captured by modeling small genomic regions individually, thereby increasing the power of TWAS fine-mapping.

    **Conclusions:** FABIO is a novel TWAS fine-mapping method tailored for binary outcomes that effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches. Its ability to jointly model all genes on an entire chromosome and capture GReX correlations enhances the precision of TWAS fine-mapping, making it a valuable tool for identifying potentially causal genes associated with complex diseases.

    **Title:** Protein Sequestration as a Key Antioxidant Defense Mechanism: Roles of Btn2 and Hsp42 in Mitigating Oxidative Stress-Induced Protein Aggregation

    **Research Question:** What are the roles of Btn2 and Hsp42 protein sequestrases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions, and how do they mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation?

    **Methods:** We investigated the functions of Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) exposed to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. We used deletion mutants of Btn2 and Hsp42, as well as overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase, to assess their roles in protein sequestration and aggregation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure. We found that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined proteostasis quality control (PQC) sites following ROS exposure, preventing the accumulation of protein aggregates. In the absence of Btn2 and Hsp42, protein aggregates accumulate, leading to oxidant sensitivity. We also identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and showed that Btn2 and Hsp42 suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that protein sequestration is a key antioxidant defense mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation. We propose that Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases play a crucial role in maintaining proteostasis by sequestering misfolded proteins into defined PQC sites, preventing their aggregation and toxicity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of protein sequestration in maintaining cellular homeostasis during oxidative stress conditions. We demonstrate that Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases are essential for protecting against widespread amorphous and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative stress conditions. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of protein misfolding diseases and the development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate their effects.

    Title: Identification of LINC03045 as a Novel Long Non-Coding RNA Regulator of Glioblastoma Invasion

    Research Question: What long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the invasive capacity of glioblastoma (GBM) cells?

    Methods: We conducted a large-scale CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screen of 2,307 candidate lncRNAs to identify those associated with GBM cell invasion. We used a Matrigel invasion assay to evaluate the effect of lncRNA knockdown on invasion capacity in three tumor lines. Top candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated knockdown, and their clinical relevance was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) survival analysis.

    Main Findings: Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion (p < 0.01) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, and its expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade (p < 0.0001). RNAseq analysis revealed that WASF3, a previously implicated gene in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with LINC03045 expression. WASF3 knockdown was associated with a significant decrease in invasion, and WASF3 overexpression rescued the invasive function lost with LINC03045 knockdown.

    Implications: This study identifies LINC03045 as a novel lncRNA critical to GBM invasion, and its expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. Our findings suggest that LINC03045 may regulate invasion via WASF3, a previously implicated gene in tumor invasion studies.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first large-scale CRISPRi screen on lncRNAs implicated in GBM invasion and identifies LINC03045 as a critical regulator of GBM invasion. Our results highlight the importance of lncRNAs in GBM biology and suggest that LINC03045 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which LINC03045 regulates GBM invasion and to explore its potential as a biomarker for GBM diagnosis and prognosis.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Brain's Probabilistic Models of Auditory Sequences: A Clustering Approach

    **Research Question:** What classes of models does the brain use to assign probabilistic representations to sequences of auditory stimuli?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel clustering procedure to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. The clustering procedure was designed to identify patterns in the EEG signals that correspond to the brain's putative model of the stimulus sequence.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus to build a model of the sequence. Specifically, we found that the brain extracts regularities from the EEG data that match the algorithm used to generate the random sequence of stimuli. This suggests that the brain's model is based on the occurrence of strong beats in the stochastic sequence.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that the brain uses a specific class of models to assign probabilistic representations to sequences of auditory stimuli. This challenges previous assumptions that the brain uses a particular class of models to organize statistical regularities of sequences of stimuli. Our results have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and represents complex auditory information.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a clustering approach in identifying the brain's probabilistic models of auditory sequences. Our findings suggest that the brain uses the occurrence of strong beats in a stochastic sequence to select a model of the sequence. This research contributes to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perception and has implications for the development of more accurate models of brain function. Future studies can build upon this work to investigate the neural basis of probabilistic modeling in the brain and its relationship to other cognitive processes.

    **Title:** Overcoming Limitations of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing: Development and Validation of Cell Type-Specific Weighting Factors (cWFs)

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a computational method to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of solid tissues and organs?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel method to calculate cell type-specific weighting factors (cWFs) to offset the limitations of scRNA-seq analysis. We computed cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs and validated their fidelity using five methods: reconstitution, deconvolution, comparison with experimentally measured transcript-contents, independence from differential cell-type ratios, and prediction using unmatched organ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that cWFs accurately account for relative variations in transcriptome size and differential cryptic gene expression among cells of solid organs. We demonstrate that cWFs are essential for accurately reconstituting and deconvolving whole-organ RNA-seq data using composite scRNA-seq data weighted by the corresponding cWFs. Furthermore, we show that cWFs recapitulate experimentally-determined total mRNA content-differences using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) data.

    **Implications:** Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues and organs. The computed cWFs have diagnostic utility and biological significance, suggesting their potential applications in predicting aging progression and understanding aging mechanisms.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study addresses and overcomes the limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of solid tissues and organs by developing a novel method to compute cWFs. The computed cWFs provide a valuable tool for accurately analyzing scRNA-seq data and have significant implications for understanding cellular composition and gene expression in complex tissues and organs. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression in scRNA-seq analysis.

    **Title:** Radial Multivariable Mendelian Randomization: A Novel Approach for Visualizing and Identifying Pleiotropic Genetic Variants in Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Analyses

    **Background:** Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) extends this approach to estimate the direct effects of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants, which violate one of the core IV assumptions.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel approach to visualize and identify pleiotropic genetic variants in MVMR analyses?

    **Methods:** We propose a radial formulation of MVMR and an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualized. Radial MVMR also includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs that may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses. Our results show that radial MVMR effectively visualizes causal effect estimates and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. We also show that outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy.

    **Implications:** Radial MVMR provides a valuable tool for identifying and removing pleiotropic genetic variants in MVMR analyses, which can lead to more accurate estimates of causal effects. This approach can be applied to a wide range of MVMR analyses, including those examining the effects of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease.

    **Conclusions:** Radial MVMR is a novel approach that addresses the limitations of traditional MVMR analyses. By visualizing and identifying pleiotropic genetic variants, radial MVMR provides a more accurate and reliable method for estimating the direct effects of multiple exposures on an outcome. The accompanying RMVMR R package facilitates the implementation of radial MVMR and provides a range of tools for exploring the results of MVMR analyses.

    **Title:** High-Resolution Analysis of Drosophila Melanogaster Behavior Reveals Novel Insights into Circadian Rhythms and Behavioral Health

    **Research Question:** How do Drosophila melanogaster behavior patterns change across timescales, from seconds to days, and what are the implications for our understanding of circadian rhythms and behavioral health?

    **Methods:** We employed high-speed video recording (100 frames per second) of 47 individual Drosophila melanogaster in featureless arenas for up to 7 days. Using the deep learning framework SLEAP, we generated a full-body postural dataset, resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and analyzed their patterns across time of day and days in the experiment.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, including trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed. Notably, we found that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, which tracks well with other indicators of health, such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spent moving vs. resting. We also observed a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days.

    **Implications:** Our high-resolution data provides a new and clearer picture of Drosophila melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the hour after dawn is a critical time point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, which may be linked to their overall behavioral health. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of considering the interactions between different timescales in animal behavior, from hours to days to lifespans.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of high-speed video recording and deep learning analysis in uncovering the complexities of animal behavior. Our results provide new insights into the circadian rhythms and behavioral health of Drosophila melanogaster, and have implications for our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms that govern behavior across timescales.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Multifaceted Roles of PTPN-22 in C. elegans Development and Tissue Integrity

    **Research Question:** What are the novel functions of the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22, and how does it interact with other proteins to regulate nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation?

    **Methods:** We employed a non-biased genetic screen to identify PTPN-22 as a suppressor of molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 and NEKL-3. Proximity labeling studies were used to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development, revealing the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22. Genetic analysis, co-localization studies, and proximity labeling were used to investigate the roles of PTPN-22 in epidermal adhesion complexes, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and mRNA regulation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in NEKL-2 and NEKL-3. Proximity labeling studies identified DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22, and genetic analysis revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes. We also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly within the germline.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions. The discovery of PTPN-22's roles in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation expands our understanding of the conserved PTPN family and suggests that PTPN-22 may play a broader role in maintaining tissue integrity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that PTPN-22 is a multifaceted phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. The identification of DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22 provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. These findings have implications for our understanding of the conserved PTPN family and suggest that PTPN-22 may play a critical role in maintaining tissue integrity in C. elegans and potentially other organisms.
Title: Spatial and Temporal Trends of Artemisinin Resistance in Southeast Asia: A Bayesian Geostatistical Modeling Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: Artemisinin resistance poses a significant threat to malaria elimination efforts in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Resistance to the current gold standard antimalarial drug, artemisinin derivatives, has been reported in several countries in the region. However, spatial information on the changing levels of artemisinin resistance is critical for health organizations to prioritize malaria control measures.

    Research Question: What are the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, particularly in the GMS, from 2000 to 2022?

    Methods: We used a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) gene, which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance. We employed a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance.

    Main Findings: Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the GMS from 2000 to 2022. The period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region. Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance, enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution.

    Implications: By predicting spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level, this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia. Our data-driven, predictive maps can be used by health agencies to guide the prioritization of surveillance for resistance and policies to improve treatment and prevent the further spread of resistance.

    Conclusions: This study presents the first data-driven, predictive maps of the changing landscape of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in the GMS. Our results are consistent with earlier modeling work and underlying data collected to assess the spread of artemisinin resistance. The findings of this study highlight the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia to inform malaria elimination efforts.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Autoinhibitory Complexes of NLRP1 Paralogs and CARD8 in the Inflammasome Signaling Pathway

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the autoinhibitory complexes formed by NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 in the inflammasome signaling pathway?

    **Methods:** We employed biochemistry approaches to investigate the interactions between N-terminal (NT), full-length (FL), and C-terminal (CT) peptides of NLRP1 paralogs (murine NLRP1b and rat NLRP1) and CARD8, as well as the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 (DPP9) in these complexes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. The Linker3 region in murine NLRP1b and the ZU5 domain in rat NLRP1 and CARD8 mediate NT-CT interactions, while the ZU5 domain of NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 interacts with DPP9 to form NT-DPP9-CT complexes. Notably, DPP9 cannot bind to the NT of human NLRP1. Functional assays revealed that DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8, but does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation, highlighting the complexity of their interactions within the immune response. The formation of distinct autoinhibitory complexes involving NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 represents a highly regulated mechanism in controlling inflammasome activation.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the autoinhibitory complexes of NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8, which are critical components of the inflammasome signaling pathway. These results have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting inflammasome activation in various inflammatory diseases.

    **Title:** Rer1 Regulates Proteostasis and Competitive Cell Survival in the Developing Drosophila Wing Epithelium

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in regulating protein homeostasis and competitive cell survival in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of Rer1 in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We generated rer1 mutant flies and analyzed the effects of Rer1 loss on protein homeostasis, cell competition, and Myc-induced overgrowth.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), indicating the onset of ER stress. Clonal analysis revealed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as "losers" and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we found that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth under high proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting Myc-driven overgrowth.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of protein homeostasis and cell competition, and highlight the importance of Rer1 in maintaining cellular fitness and tissue health.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that Rer1 plays a critical role in regulating protein homeostasis and competitive cell survival in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. The upregulation of Rer1 upon Myc-overexpression suggests that Rer1 provides cytoprotection to cells under high proteotoxic stress, supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of protein homeostasis and cell competition, and highlight the potential of Rer1 as a novel regulator of cellular fitness and tissue health.

    **Title:** High-Throughput Functional Analysis of CHEK2 Variants Reveals Loss-of-Function Mutations Associated with Increased Cancer Risk

    **Research Question:** What is the functional impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene on protein function, and how do these variants contribute to cancer risk?

    **Methods:** We employed a high-throughput technique of deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test the ability of all but two of the 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53.

    **Main Findings:** Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 SNVs were found to be damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. These results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the functional impact of CHEK2 variants, which can be used to predict the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance found in susceptibility screening. This approach can be applied to other cancer risk genes, enabling more accurate risk assessment and personalized medicine.

    **Conclusions:** Our high-throughput functional analysis of CHEK2 variants reveals that loss-of-function mutations are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. The results of this study provide a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers to predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants, ultimately contributing to improved cancer risk assessment and prevention strategies. The approach used in this study can be adapted to other cancer risk genes, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of cancer susceptibility.

    **Title:** Regulation of Epigenetic and Phenotypic Diversity in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the SpxA1-TenA Toxin-Antitoxin System

    **Research Question:** How does Streptococcus pneumoniae control the epigenetic and phenotypic diversity generated by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches to investigate the regulation of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system in S. pneumoniae. We overexpressed TenA in E. coli and S. pneumoniae, and analyzed the effects on growth and autolysis. We also performed affinity pull-down assays to identify proteins interacting with TenA.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a novel type II toxin-antitoxin system, SpxA1-TenA, which regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits, such as colony opacity. TenA, the toxin, is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin, SpxA1. We found that TenA binds to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX, which activates natural transformation-associated genes. Attenuation of ComX expression enhances the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, favoring the formation of transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the SpxA1-TenA system acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. Spontaneous variations in the AT dinucleotide repeat region upstream of the spxA1-tenA promoter may represent a mechanism of epigenetic adaptation in S. pneumoniae.

    **Conclusions:** The SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system plays a crucial role in regulating the epigenetic and phenotypic diversity of S. pneumoniae by controlling the orientations of hsdS inversions. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae and highlights the importance of the SpxA1-TenA system in generating epigenetic and phenotypic diversity in this human pathogen.

    **Title:** Generalized Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (gcPCA): A Hyperparameter-Free Approach for Comparing High-Dimensional Biological Datasets

    **Research Question:** How can we develop a dimensionality reduction method that can compare two high-dimensional biological datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition?

    **Background:** High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, but traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are limited in their ability to compare two datasets. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it requires tuning a hyperparameter (α) resulting in multiple solutions with no way of knowing which is correct.

    **Methods:** We developed Generalized Contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible, hyperparameter-free approach that solves the problems associated with cPCA. We first analyzed the role of the α hyperparameter in cPCA and proposed a strategy to eliminate it. We then developed an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrated the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, including the unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our results show that gcPCA is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method that provides a valuable resource for analyzing diverse high-dimensional datasets.

    **Implications:** gcPCA has the potential to facilitate the analysis of complex biological phenomena by enabling the comparison of high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions. This can lead to new insights into the underlying biological processes and mechanisms.

    **Conclusions:** gcPCA is a novel, hyperparameter-free approach that addresses the limitations of traditional dimensionality reduction techniques and cPCA. Our results demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the biological sciences.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of B Cell Receptor Signaling in B Cell Lymphomas: A Semi-Quantitative Network Analysis

    **Research Question:** How does B cell receptor (BCR) signaling contribute to the survival and maturation of B cells, and what are the downstream effector pathways involved in B cell lymphomas?

    **Methods:** We employed a semi-quantitative modeling approach to investigate BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our models revealed feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. We verified the relevance of this crosstalk in BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed it by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Notably, the trained network for BL-2 cells was more transferable to BL-41 cells, and the BL-2 network was also suitable for modeling BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling, which can be used as a starting point to quantify cell-specific, individual networks. This supports the view that our model reflects common elements of intracellular signaling in acute B-cell signaling. The discovery of feedbacks and crosstalks in ERK and p38 signaling highlights the complexity of BCR signaling in B cell lymphomas.

    **Conclusions:** Our semi-quantitative network model of BCR signaling in BL-2 cells forms a solid base to describe signaling networks in DLBCL cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling. The conserved signaling motifs across different B cell lymphoma types suggest that insights from this study may apply to other B cell lymphomas. Importantly, our modeling procedure discovered novel connections that significantly improved the model fit, including a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70, and a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Basis of Notch Signalling in Angiogenic Sprouting: A Novel Role for Heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 Complexes

    **Research Question:** How do the Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1 control angiogenic sprouting, and what is the molecular basis of their opposing actions?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental approaches, including biochemical assays and mathematical modelling, to investigate the molecular control of Notch1 receptor activity by DLL4 and JAG1.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that DLL4, rather than JAG1, induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation, while JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complexes play a crucial role in regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tip cells and trailing stalk cells, enabling angiogenic sprouting. This novel mechanism could underlie the observed opposing effects of JAG1 and DLL4 in sprouting angiogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular basis of Notch signalling and its role in angiogenic sprouting. We propose a theoretical model of DLL4/JAG1-Notch signalling that incorporates the novel finding that JAG1 directly antagonizes the function of DLL4 through the formation of heteromeric DLL4-JAG1 complexes. Our results have significant implications for understanding the complex interplay between Notch signalling and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) signalling in angiogenesis.

    **Significance:** This study advances our understanding of Notch signalling and its role in angiogenic sprouting, and highlights the importance of heteromeric complexes in regulating Notch receptor activity. Our findings have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis-related diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.

    **Title:** Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc): A Bayesian Nonparametric Clustering Algorithm for Data with Associated Uncertainty

    **Background:** Clustering is a widely used technique in bioinformatics and other fields for exploratory analysis and prediction. However, many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error, which is rarely used to inform the clustering process.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points to improve clustering performance?

    **Methods:** We propose Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We demonstrate the performance of DPMUnc on simulated data and real-world applications, including clustering immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS summary statistics and gene expression datasets.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that DPMUnc outperforms existing methods on simulated data and accurately separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We also demonstrate the value of using DPMUnc to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarized using gene signatures. Our novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different from the one where it was discovered incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual.

    **Implications:** The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering, and we present a method that does this, DPMUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined, which can be crucial for summarizing gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty into clustering algorithms and demonstrate the value of DPMUnc for clustering data with associated uncertainty. The proposed method of summarizing a gene expression across a signature extends the possible uses of signatures and can be crucial for taking into account the variability of the signature in datasets with complex structure.

    **Title:** Investigating the Shape-Dependence of Primate Vision in Deep Neural Networks

    **Research Question:** Why do deep neural networks, despite their remarkable success in modeling the primate visual system, fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision?

    **Methods:** We designed simple, artificial image datasets where shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict image class. We trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, using various architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, while others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards other features, such as color and texture. We found that the bias can be explained by the interactions between weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that the color- and texture-bias in deep neural networks arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning, specifically from the way that gradients for color and texture features align with image classes. Our results indicate that enabling deep networks to recognize shapes will likely require changes to the learning algorithm, rather than changes to network architecture. We propose that reducing the alignment between color- and texture-selective gradients enables networks to learn shape-based classification. Our study provides new insights into the limitations of deep neural networks in modeling primate vision and highlights the need for more effective learning algorithms to improve their shape-sensitivity.
Title: Multiscale Modeling of Hepatic Stellate Cell Dynamics in Liver Fibrosis and Reversion

    Abstract:

    Background: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the development of liver fibrosis, a condition characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, leading to impaired liver function in chronic liver diseases. However, the dynamics of HSCs during fibrosis progression and reversion remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: How do HSCs contribute to liver fibrosis and reversion, and what are the regulatory mechanisms underlying their dynamics?

    Methods: We developed rule-based models using the Kappa graph rewriting language to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We integrated information from literature and proposed hypotheses to describe the interactions between HSCs and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) molecules, which regulate HSC activation and ECM secretion.

    Main Findings: Simulation studies revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion. We demonstrated that inactivation allows the elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, while reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we showed that the model is sensitive to TGFβ1 parameters, suggesting its adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions.

    Implications: Our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease, which can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. We also validated the predicted ECM dynamics using experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Moreover, our model predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease, which was confirmed by analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches and provides a novel model of HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion. Our findings highlight the regulatory role of HSC inactivation loops in liver fibrosis and predict the accumulation of iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. This model can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of liver disease and potential therapeutic targets.
Title: A Novel Meta-Analysis Framework for Estimating Total Mediation Effects of High-Dimensional Omics Mediators in Large-Scale Genomic Consortia

    Abstract:
    Background: Meta-analysis is a powerful tool for aggregating the effects of interest across multiple studies. However, its application in mediation analysis, particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, is largely underexplored.

    Research Question: Can a novel meta-analysis framework be developed to estimate the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators in large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program?

    Methods: We developed a novel meta-analysis framework that leverages the asymptotic standard error of the R-squared (R2)-based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators. This framework requires only summary statistics and allows for inter-study heterogeneity. We applied this method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

    Main Findings: Our simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub.

    Implications: This novel meta-analysis framework can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to varying genomic profiling platforms, making it an appealing alternative to analysis of the entire dataset at once. The R2 measure can not only characterize the overall mediation effect but is also applicable to individual significant mediators.

    Conclusions: Our novel meta-analysis framework provides a powerful tool for estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators in large-scale genomic consortia. This framework has the potential to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases, ultimately contributing to the development of precision medicine.

    **Title:** Personalized Driver Gene Prediction in Cancer: A Novel Method for Identifying Tumor-Specific Drivers

    **Background:** Cancer development is driven by a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer a selective growth advantage to cells, while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. Identifying these driver genes is crucial for designing effective cancer treatments. However, existing computational methods often provide a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients, ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel method to prioritize mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles?

    **Methods:** We propose a novel method, PDRWH, which integrates genome/transcriptome analysis to identify candidate personalized driver genes by leveraging the influence of mutated genes on biological networks across cohort samples. PDRWH requires knowledge of cohort samples from a specific cancer type, including somatic mutation and gene expression profiles, as well as a gene interaction network.

    **Main Findings:** Our results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. In comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods. Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH can identify both common and rare drivers.

    **Implications:** The personalized driver profiles generated by PDRWH can improve tumor stratification, providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment. We also validated one of our predicted novel personalized driver genes, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), on tumor cell proliferation using in vitro cell-based assays.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel method, PDRWH, has demonstrated reliable performance in inferring personalized driver genes, which is promising for discovering potential causal genetic variants obscured by tumor heterogeneity. We expect that PDRWH will assist in the development of optimal personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients.

    **Title:** Enhancing the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) Model with Global Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification

    **Research Question:** Can the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) model, a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy, be improved using a global optimization approach and uncertainty quantification to better estimate pathological brain areas and inform clinical decision-making?

    **Methods:** This study employed a global optimization approach using the SaCeSS cooperative metaheuristic algorithm to calibrate VEP models. The algorithm leveraged parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. To further enhance performance, a Bayesian optimization framework was used for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, a scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems.

    **Main Findings:** The proposed approach successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance compared to other parallel solvers. The results showed significant gains in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The uncertainty quantification phase allowed for the assessment of the variability in estimated parameters, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the model's reliability.

    **Implications:** The improved VEP model has the potential to enhance the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby informing clinical decision-making. By accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings, this technique offers a versatile platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid in clinical decision-making.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach and uncertainty quantification. The proposed method has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in epilepsy, ultimately informing clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes. The use of parallel computation and Bayesian optimization further enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the VEP model, making it a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers in the field of epilepsy.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Replication in Rabbit Lungs: A Novel Approach to Understanding TB Pathogenesis

    **Background:** Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health burden, with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. While pulmonary TB is well understood, quantitative estimates of Mtb replication and death rates in lungs of patients or animals are largely unknown.

    **Research Question:** What are the dynamics of Mtb replication and death in rabbit lungs infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10?

    **Methods:** We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments using rabbits infected with HN878-pBP10. In vitro experiments showed that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 than in the commonly used laboratory-adapted strain H37Rv. In vivo experiments revealed that the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in rabbit lungs did not follow a monotonic decline, with an increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells between 28 and 56 days post-infection.

    **Main Findings:** Mathematical modeling suggested that the non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained by the presence of multiple sub-populations of Mtb with different replication/death kinetics. One major population expands early and is controlled/eliminated, while a smaller population expands at later times, causing an increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments by following HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights differences in Mtb dynamics between rabbits and mice, confirming that "rabbits are not mice." The results suggest that HN878-pBP10 undergoes a larger number of replications than H37Rv in mice, further emphasizing the importance of using relevant animal models for TB research. Our findings open avenues for future research on Mtb growth dynamics in TB granulomas and may lead to a better understanding of how immunity controls Mtb replication and death.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the dynamics of Mtb replication and death in rabbit lungs, highlighting the importance of using relevant animal models for TB research. Our findings have implications for understanding TB pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to control Mtb replication and death.

    **Title:** GlycanTreeModeler: A Computational Algorithm for Accurate Glycan Structure Prediction and Design

    **Research Question:** Can a novel glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, accurately predict glycan structures de novo and build them into known density, facilitating glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and experimental structure determination?

    **Methods:** We developed GlycanTreeModeler, a glycan-modeling algorithm that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer using adaptive kernel density estimates (KDE) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. We benchmarked GlycanTreeModeler on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths and employed it to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition.

    **Main Findings:** GlycanTreeModeler achieved high accuracy in predicting glycan structures de novo and building them into known density, with a median de novo root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.7 Å. We also demonstrated the algorithm's ability to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine, which experimentally verified shielding of regions from antibody recognition.

    **Implications:** This work has significant implications for glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and experimental structure determination. GlycanTreeModeler's ability to accurately predict glycan structures de novo and build them into known density will aid in the development of novel glycoprotein-based therapeutics and vaccines.

    **Conclusions:** GlycanTreeModeler is a powerful computational tool for glycan structure prediction and design. Its ability to accurately predict glycan structures de novo and build them into known density makes it a valuable asset for glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and experimental structure determination. This work will inform the development of novel glycoprotein-based therapeutics and vaccines, and will further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement.

    **Title:** Identification of the SCFFbx23-Ace1 Ubiquitin Ligase-Substrate Pair in Penicillium oxalicum and Its Role in Regulating Gene Transcription

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the SCFFbx23-Ace1 ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair in regulating gene transcription in Penicillium oxalicum?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including RT-qPCR, transcriptome analysis, and protein-protein interaction assays, to identify and characterize the SCFFbx23-Ace1 ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair in Penicillium oxalicum.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, in P. oxalicum, where the F-box protein PoFbx23 recognizes and activates the transcription factor PoAce1 within the nucleus. PoAce1 is a ubiquitinated protein that regulates the transcription of target genes with different effects (activating or repressing) under different signals. Deletion of the Pofbx23 gene resulted in the accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein, which is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of target genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects under different signals. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression in P. oxalicum and highlights the importance of the SCFFbx23-Ace1 ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair in maintaining PoAce1’s activity.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the critical role of the SCFFbx23-Ace1 ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair in regulating gene transcription in P. oxalicum. Our findings have implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression in filamentous fungi and provide a new model for the PoFbx23-Ace1 regulating gene transcription. The identification of the SCFFbx23-Ace1 ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair in P. oxalicum highlights the potential of this organism as a model system for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression in fungi.

    **Title:** Molecular Mechanisms of Basement Membrane Diversification in Drosophila Melanogaster Follicular Epithelium

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the diversification of basement membrane (BM) formation in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium, and how do distinct secretory routes contribute to BM morphogenesis?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate BM protein secretion in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium. Specifically, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Rab10 and Rab8, key regulators of BM protein secretion, and analyzed the effects on BM formation. We also examined the role of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and the exocyst complex in BM protein secretion.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel secretory routes for BM protein secretion in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, resulting in the formation of homogenous BM. We also found that the DAPC and Rab10 are present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins, and that DAPC is essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. Furthermore, we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in BM protein secretion: it directly interacts with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization and is also required for the Rab8 route.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of distinct secretory routes in BM diversification during development. The co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by Rab10 and Rab8, with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes, provides a basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development. Proper BM protein secretion and BM diversification are essential for development, and our work provides new mechanistic insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that BM diversification during development can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites. The synergic effect of Rab8 and Rab10 KD suggests that these two Rabs are part of alternative routes with a partial redundancy for addressing BM proteins. Our findings have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying BM formation and morphogenesis in development.
Title: Predicting HIV-1 Resistance to Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies using Multi-Task Learning: Addressing Challenges in HIV-1 Vaccine Research

Abstract:

Background: The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) has shown promise in treating HIV-1 infection. However, predicting HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs remains a significant challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful approach for predicting HIV-1 resistance, but current models face two major challenges: underrepresentation of certain HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets and the need to determine optimal combinations of bnAbs to avoid resistance.

Research Question: Can multi-task learning (MTL) models address these challenges and improve the prediction of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs?

Methods: We developed a novel MTL model, named Language-Based Universal Model (LBUM), which was pre-trained on Env sequences without neutralization data and fine-tuned on Env sequences with both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. We compared the performance of LBUM to classical machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF) and gradient boosting machines (GBM).

Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that MTL models can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and select optimal bnAb combinations. We show that MTL models outperform classical machine learning algorithms in predicting HIV-1 resistance to multiple bnAbs.

Implications: Our study addresses two major challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research: underrepresentation of certain HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets and the need to determine optimal combinations of bnAbs. The LBUM model provides a powerful tool for predicting HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs, which can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential of MTL models in addressing key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research. The LBUM model offers a promising approach for predicting HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs, and its adaptability to other infectious diseases makes it a valuable resource for the scientific community.

    Title: Pathway-Based Models Outperform Gene-Based Models in Predicting Multiple Myeloma Prognosis

    Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite advances in treatment, prognosis varies significantly between patients, underscoring the need for accurate prognostic models to inform therapeutic decision-making.

    Research Question: Can pathway-based models, which incorporate pathway information, outperform gene-based models in predicting MM prognosis?

    Methods: We employed two strategies to construct predictive models: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. We considered three methods for pathway score calculation (ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM (GSE136324) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in internal validation.

    Main Findings: Our results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information (Vax(grp)) outperformed the gene-based model in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including Vax pathways, was found to be more predictive for MM. Vax(grp) also outperformed previously published models. Notably, the new model was more resistant to missing values, and the presence of missing values (<5%) did not significantly deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that pathway-based models, particularly those incorporating immune-related pathways, are competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM prognosis. These models have the potential to improve therapeutic decision-making and provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying MM development and progression.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the utility of pathway-based models in predicting MM prognosis and highlights the importance of incorporating pathway information into predictive models. The R package (https://github.com/ShuoStat/MMMs) documenting our computational workflow and missing data imputation method will facilitate future validation and application of these models in clinical settings.

    **Title:** Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Modeling of Drp1-Dependent Mitochondrial Fission Reveals Critical Regulatory Parameters

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating mitochondrial fission in response to cellular insult, and how can we identify key regulatory parameters to fine-tune this process?

    **Methods:** We developed a nonlinear dynamical systems model of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model focuses on the process of mitochondrial fission following cellular injury, when the concentration of Drp1 in the cytosol is increased.

    **Main Findings:** Our model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k -, where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) and k+ and k- are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. We found that the total fission rate (TFR) and cumulative total fission (TF) depend strongly on only one dimensionless parameter, μ, which represents the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase with μ; instead, it increases to a certain point and then decreases as μ continues to increase.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that interventions targeting k+, k-, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic target selection. The identification of μ as a key regulatory parameter for Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

    **Conclusions:** Our nonlinear dynamical systems model of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating this complex process. The identification of μ as a critical regulatory parameter has important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to modulate mitochondrial fission in response to cellular insult. Future studies should investigate the role of μ in regulating mitochondrial fission and its potential as a therapeutic target.

    **Title:** Overcoming Resistance to CRISPR-based Gene Drives: A Novel 3-gRNA Homing System Targeting Tdc2 in Drosophila suzukii

    **Research Question:** Can a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest, mitigate the rapid evolution of resistance alleles?

    **Methods:** We constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the Tdc2 gene in Drosophila suzukii using the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool. We also tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency.

    **Main Findings:** Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets. We found that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. The use of a 3-gRNA homing system targeting functionally constrained regions may mitigate the development of resistance alleles, making CRISPR-based gene drives more effective for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests.

    **Conclusions:** Our research demonstrates the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct fGD systems targeting the haplosufficient female fertility gene Tdc2 in both Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster. The conditional rescue of the Tdc2 mutant phenotype by feeding octopamine offers a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. Our findings have significant implications for the development of CRISPR-based gene drives for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests.

**Title:** Energy-Efficient Learning in Feedforward Neural Networks: Exploring Plasticity Restricting Algorithms

**Research Question:** What are the energy requirements for learning in feedforward neural networks, and can we develop algorithms that restrict plasticity to save metabolic energy associated with synaptic updates?

**Methods:** We developed a parsimonious energy model to estimate the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. We proposed two plasticity restricting algorithms: 1) only modifying synapses with large updates, and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. We tested these algorithms on a feedforward neural network trained on the MNIST dataset to 95% accuracy.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that there is an approximate square root relation between energy and network size (M1 ∝ Nh0.43). We found that restricting plasticity can lead to significant energy savings while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Specifically, by only allowing plasticity in a random subset of synapses using a random binary mask, we achieved energy savings of up to 90% compared to vanilla backpropagation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the brain has likely evolved to learn using as little energy as possible, and that restricting plasticity can be an effective strategy for saving metabolic energy associated with synaptic updates. This has implications for both artificial and biological learning, as it may lead to a better understanding of observed synaptic plasticity rules and the development of more energy-efficient learning algorithms.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering energy constraints in the development of learning algorithms. By restricting plasticity, we can achieve significant energy savings while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Future studies should explore how to adapt these algorithms to task difficulty and network architecture, and how to reduce the energy required for neural signaling, such as synaptic transmission and spike generation. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a better understanding of biological plasticity and the development of more energy-efficient learning rules.

    Title: Laboratory Evolution Overcomes Fitness Defects in Reduced-Genome Strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx

    Research Question: Can laboratory evolution compensate for fitness defects resulting from genome streamlining in reduced-genome strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx?

    Methods: We engineered eight reduced-genome strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx with deletions of 22- to 42-kilobase regions, as well as two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. We then evolved replicate populations of each strain for ~300 generations in chemically defined minimal medium or complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates.

    Main Findings: Fitness increased in all cases examined, except for two ancestors that failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across all strains, although the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment.

    Implications: Our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can be rapidly regained through laboratory evolution, and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments. This suggests that laboratory evolution can be a valuable strategy for improving the fitness of reduced-genome strains.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential of laboratory evolution to overcome fitness defects resulting from genome streamlining in reduced-genome strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx. The frequent mutations in the global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq suggest that these regulators play a key role in compensating for the effects of earlier deletions on gene function and bacterial fitness. Overall, our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of genome streamlining and the potential of laboratory evolution to improve the fitness of reduced-genome strains.

    **Title:** Development of a Self-Cleaving Ribozyme-Based Tool for Precise Control of Endogenous Gene Expression in Zebrafish

    **Research Question:** Can a self-cleaving ribozyme be used to control the expression of endogenous genes in vertebrates, specifically in zebrafish?

    **Methods:** We developed a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool, T3H48, and inserted it into the second intron of the albino gene in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9. We also generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the ribozyme, called RiboFlip, to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. Additionally, we used a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme and demonstrate its reversibility.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the T3H48 ribozyme induces rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, resulting in up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and displays superior activity compared to other ribozymes. We observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the albino mutant in zebrafish embryos after inserting the T3H48 ribozyme into the albino gene. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the phenotype is reversible using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme. We also generated a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette to label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene.

    **Implications:** Our study introduces the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model, providing an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies. The zebrafish model allows for efficient screening of genetic tools due to its external fertilization and rapid early development.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using self-cleaving ribozymes to control endogenous gene expression in vertebrates, specifically in zebrafish. The RiboFlip cassette offers a powerful tool for functional genomics in vertebrates, enabling precise and reversible control of gene expression. This approach has the potential to advance our understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms in vertebrates.

    **Title:** aiSEGcell: A User-Friendly Convolutional Neural Network-Based Software for Nucleus Segmentation in Bright Field Images

    **Research Question:** Can a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based software accurately segment nuclei from bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling, and is it accessible to users with no prior coding experience?

    **Methods:** We developed aiSEGcell, a user-friendly software that utilizes a generic image segmentation approach to segment nuclei from BF images. We extensively evaluated aiSEGcell on hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets containing 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images from different primary cell types in 2D cultures from various imaging modalities.

    **Main Findings:** aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging BF images, similar to manual segmentation, and retains biologically relevant information, such as for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. The software is readily adaptable to new use cases, requiring only 32 images for retraining, and is accessible through both a command line and a napari graphical user interface.

    **Implications:** The ability to segment nuclei from BF images without fluorescent labeling eliminates the need for transgenic or dye labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity, and speeds up imaging. This approach also enables the use of additional fluorescent markers, improving experimental workflows.

    **Conclusions:** aiSEGcell is a user-friendly, CNN-based software that can accurately segment nuclei from BF images, even in challenging conditions such as low magnification and time-lapse imaging of primary cells. Its accessibility to users with no prior coding experience and adaptability to new use cases make it a valuable tool for biologists and researchers. The release of aiSEGcell with already trained models to segment nuclei and whole cells in BF images provides a valuable resource for the scientific community.

    **Title:** Humans Favor Slower Features in Reinforcement Learning: Evidence for a Slowness Prior

    **Research Question:** Do humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments? Specifically, do humans learn more efficiently when task-relevant features change slowly rather than quickly?

    **Methods:** In two experiments and one preregistered replication, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. We manipulated the speed of change of the features and measured participants' ability to learn and generalize the feature-reward mapping.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that participants accrued more reward when a bandit's relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We found no difference in the ability to generalize to unseen feature values between conditions. Using a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models, we revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants' performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates.

    **Implications:** These findings provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favors slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. This bias may aid learning task states in a reinforcement learning domain by leveraging the common property that causal processes tend to evolve on a slower timescale than noise.

    **Conclusions:** Our study extends research on the slowness prior to humans and suggests that it aids learning task states in a reinforcement learning domain. The results have implications for understanding human decision-making and learning in complex environments, where identifying goal-relevant features is a central challenge. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the speed of feature changes in the design of reinforcement learning algorithms and decision-making tasks.
Title: Identification of Resf1 as a Novel Metastasis Susceptibility Gene in ER-Negative Breast Cancer

    Abstract:
    Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, including ER-negative breast cancer, which has the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. Here, we extend those studies to identify Resf1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER-negative breast cancer. We employed CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model (MMTV-PyMT) to demonstrate that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER-negative breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of Resf1 in metastasis susceptibility in ER-negative breast cancer?

    Methods:
    We employed a mouse systems genetics approach, using CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model (MMTV-PyMT), to investigate the role of Resf1 in metastasis susceptibility in ER-negative breast cancer.

    Main Findings:
    Our results demonstrate that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that Resf1 is a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER-negative breast cancer, and its loss enhances tumor progression through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control.

    Conclusions:
    Our study identifies Resf1 as a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis in this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat metastasis in ER-negative breast cancer.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in Meiotic Recombination: A Genome-Wide Analysis

    **Research Question:** How do the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 regulate meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

    **Methods:** We employed two strategies to investigate the genome-wide roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination: deletion of the mismatch repair protein Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor. We mapped meiotic recombination patterns at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome in rad24Δ and mec1-mn (‘meiotic null’) backgrounds.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that loss of Rad24 severely impacts spore viability and reduces recombination frequency, driven by a shortened prophase. In contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and has less effect on spore viability. Notably, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. We also observed that Mec1 and Rad24 have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers (COs), with CO distributions becoming more random upon loss of either protein.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency. The loss of Mec1 helps to suppress broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DNA damage response. These results provide new insights into the complex interplay between Mec1, Rad24, and other proteins in regulating meiotic recombination.

    **Conclusions:** Our genome-wide analysis reveals that Mec1 and Rad24 play distinct roles in meiotic recombination, with Rad24 acting as a pro-CO factor and Mec1 regulating recombination frequency. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying meiotic recombination and the regulation of crossovers during meiosis.

    Title: Dissecting the Biology of Pneumocystis jirovecii through In Silico Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling

    Background: Pneumocystis jirovecii is a deadly fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite its significant impact on human health, limited progress has been made in understanding its pathobiology due to the inability to culture the organism in vitro.

    Research Question: What are the metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder the growth of Pneumocystis jirovecii in vitro?

    Methods: We developed a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism using recently published genome data and available information in the literature. We employed relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium.

    Main Findings: Our in silico model revealed metabolic requirements and imbalances that prevent Pneumocystis growth in vitro. We identified critical components of the growth medium and suggested how to supplement it to enhance Pneumocystis growth. Our model also replicated drop-off and gene knockout experiments, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in the development of new antifungal drug targets.

    Implications: Our findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumocystis and offer a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro. The model can be used to predict metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of the growth medium, facilitating the development of new antifungal therapies.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the power of in silico metabolic modeling in addressing the major bottleneck in Pneumocystis research. By combining in silico modeling with experimental phenotyping, we can overcome the limitations of in vitro culture methods and gain a deeper understanding of Pneumocystis biology. This approach has the potential to accelerate the development of new antifungal therapies and improve our understanding of this deadly fungal pathogen.
Title: Investigating the Role of YAP/TAZ in Cancer Cell Proliferation: A 3D Mathematical Modeling Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation. While YAP/TAZ levels are significantly higher in cancer cells than in normal cells, it remains unclear whether this increase alone is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of the Hippo pathway and maintain cell growth under high-density conditions.

    Research Question: Can a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells overcome the inhibitory effect of the Hippo pathway and sustain cell proliferation under high-density conditions?

    Methods: We developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway and cell-cell interactions. The model simulated cell proliferation, cell division, and growth, taking into account adhesion, repulsion, and frictional forces between cells. We solved reaction and molecular dynamics (MD) equations using the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a softcore character to assign exclusive domains to each cell.

    Main Findings: Our simulations showed that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest and sustain cell proliferation under high-density conditions, compared to normal cells.

    Implications: These findings suggest that increased YAP/TAZ alone can bypass contact inhibition under high-density conditions, contributing to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells. Our model provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of both cell density and YAP/TAZ concentration on proliferation, shedding light on the proliferative characteristics of normal and cancer cells.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of 3D mathematical modeling to investigate the role of YAP/TAZ in cancer cell proliferation. Our model can be used to evaluate cancer malignancy, explore therapeutic interventions targeting YAP/TAZ, and optimize drug dosages. The source codes are freely available, allowing for further development and application of this model in the field of cancer research.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Sequence Grammar of Low-Complexity Domains in Biomolecular Condensates: An Energy Landscape Framework

    **Research Question:** How do the molecular sequence patterns of low-complexity domains (LCDs) govern the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condensates, and what are the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel energy landscape framework, Free Energy Landscape of Stickers (FELaS), which operates on a continuous "stickiness" energy scale to investigate the effects of LCD sequence patterns on condensate dynamics and material properties. We characterized sequences by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts and mapped diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. We found that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the energy landscape framework explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity through sticker periodicity and strength variations.

    **Implications:** Our study addresses a critical gap in understanding the role of sequence complexity in governing the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condensates. The FELaS framework provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties of biomolecular condensates, advancing our understanding of their dynamics and functional roles. These insights have significant implications for understanding the evolutionary development of phase-separating biomolecules and the biological functions of LCDs.

    **Conclusions:** Our energy landscape framework offers a powerful tool for dissecting how the complexity of LCD patterns, quantified by periodicity and disorder in sticky LCD regions, impact the dynamics and material properties of resulting condensates. By elucidating the sequence grammar of LCDs, we provide a foundation for understanding the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences and the biological functions of biomolecular condensates.

    **Title:** Shh Signaling and Non-Muscle Myosin II Regulate Dental Epithelial Invagination through Cell-Cell Adhesion and Convergent Cell Movement

    **Research Question:** How does Shh signaling lead to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes during the development of ectodermal organs, specifically in the formation of dental epithelial invagination?

    **Methods:** Using the mouse dentition as a model, we investigated the role of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) in dental epithelial invagination and its regulation by Shh signaling. We employed pharmacological and genetic approaches to manipulate MyoII activity and Shh signaling, and analyzed the effects on cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movement.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that MyoII is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing MyoII activation via the AKT pathway. Pharmacological induction of AKT and MyoII can rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh, supporting a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through MyoII to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial morphogenesis, highlighting the critical role of Shh signaling and MyoII in regulating cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movement. The Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis is essential for maintaining proper cell-cell adhesion and promoting convergent cell movement, which drives epithelial invagination.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of MyoII in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium, consistent with prior findings showing that MyoII-generated cellular forces are essential for the maintenance and growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells. Future studies will determine the precise role of cell-cell adhesion and the relative contribution of adherence junctions, tight junctions, and desmosomes in regulating cellular rearrangement during these processes.

    **Title:** scTGCN: A Robust Deep Transfer Model for Integrating Single-Cell Omics Data

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel transfer learning approach to integrate and analyze large-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data from different modalities, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, while preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity?

    **Methods:** We propose a single-cell transfer graph convolutional network (scTGCN) model, which leverages graph convolutional networks to formulate and aggregate cell-cell relationships and gene expression with kinetic relationships between specific regulatory mechanisms of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. We employ a multistage transfer learning strategy to reduce domain discrepancy and improve the robustness of results.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that scTGCN achieves high label transfer accuracy and effectively transfers knowledge across different modalities, including mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. We show that scTGCN can accurately transfer cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq.

    **Implications:** The scTGCN model has the potential to empower the exploration of single-cell omics data by enabling the integration and analysis of larger-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data. Our approach addresses the challenges of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets, making it a valuable tool for understanding complex biological mechanisms.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, scTGCN is a novel transfer learning approach based on graph convolutional networks that enables the integration and analysis of larger-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data. Our model is versatile and effectively combines different types of measurements, even if the data is unpaired. We provide evidence that scTGCN can accurately transfer cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, making it a powerful tool for understanding complex biological mechanisms.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Sequence Specificity of Nuclear Localization Sequences in Mcm3: Implications for Cell Growth and Chromatin Loading

    **Research Question:** What is the precise sequence specificity of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase, and how does it interact with importin proteins to facilitate nuclear transport?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) modeling to characterize the sequence specificity of Mcm3's NLS. We generated mutations at specific basic residues within the NLS and examined their effects on nuclear import, chromatin loading, and cell growth.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Specifically, mutations at positions 2 and 3 (P2 and P3) of the NLS were found to be essential for nuclear import, while mutations at position 4 (P4) had a less critical role.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which lack a single consensus sequence but retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. Further characterization of Mcm3's NLS will not only elucidate its cell cycle-dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading but also refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of precise sequence specificity in NLSs for nuclear transport and chromatin loading. The results have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of nuclear import and the regulation of cell growth, and provide a foundation for further biophysical studies to characterize the interactions between Mcm3's NLS and importin proteins.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Ataxin-2 in Translational Control and Neurodegeneration

    **Background:** Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. Recent studies have shown that ATXN2 can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 in mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules, and how do structured and non-structured interactions contribute to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration?

    **Methods:** We conducted a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins using Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE), co-localization, and immunoprecipitation experiments. We also used Gal80ts-controlled elav-Gal4 to express Atx2ΔPAM2-ADARcd in brains of adult Drosophila for 5 days and used RNA-Seq to identify edited RNAs in polyA selected brain RNA.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2, which interacts with polyA-binding protein (PABP), is a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Experiments with transgenic Drosophila suggest that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity.

    **Implications:** Our findings propose a model for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Ataxin-2 function in mRNA translation and mRNP assembly, and highlights the importance of the PAM2 motif in recruiting Atx2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into Ataxin-2 granules. These findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for ALS and related conditions.

    Title: Spatiotemporal Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Stem Cells in Extraocular and Limb Muscles Reveals a Relay between Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7

    Research Question: How do gene regulatory networks upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants differ between extraocular muscles (EOMs) and limb muscles, and what is the role of Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 in the specification and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in these anatomical locations?

    Methods: We used a combination of genetically modified and lineage-traced mice to examine the spatiotemporal functional roles of Pitx2 and Pax7 in the emergence and maintenance of the EOM progenitor population. We invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally, postnatally, and during lineage progression, and analyzed the effects on MuSCs in EOMs and limb muscles.

    Main Findings: Our study reveals that Pitx2 becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the MuSC pool in EOMs, despite being a major upstream regulator during early development. Constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in EOMs compared to limb muscles. We propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. Additionally, we found that MuSCs in EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally.

    Implications: Our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterization of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy. The findings suggest that Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 play distinct roles in the specification and maintenance of MuSCs in EOMs and limb muscles, and that EOMs have a unique regulatory network that contributes to their resistance to muscular dystrophy.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of understanding the spatiotemporal regulation of MuSCs in different anatomical locations and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells in EOMs and limb muscles. The findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for muscular dystrophy and other muscle disorders.

    **Title:** Development of a Novel VOCs-Informed Neural Network (VOCs-INN) for Simulating the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants

    **Research Question:** Can a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) integrated with an infectious disease model accurately simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants and predict their transmission intensity among the human population?

    **Methods:** This study proposes a novel algorithm, VOCs-INN, which combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. The algorithm integrates physical information neural networks (PINNs) with infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters.

    **Main Findings:** Our experiments demonstrate that VOCs-INN can accurately fit reported data of SARS-CoV-2 variants in British Columbia, Canada, and its five internal health agencies. The algorithm can also simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. Furthermore, VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.

    **Implications:** The integration of PINNs with infectious disease models, particularly through the proposed VOCs-INN approach, represents a significant research contribution. VOCs-INN leverages available observational data and the underlying physical principles governing infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants and inform public health measures.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of VOCs-INN in simulating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants and predicting their transmission intensity. The algorithm's ability to capture the time-varying nature of parameters and infer complex dynamics makes it a valuable tool for infectious disease modeling. As we continue to develop and refine VOCs-INN, we aim to integrate it with other advanced machine-learning methods to better fit and predict infectious disease data. Ultimately, VOCs-INN has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective public health strategies for mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

    Title: CytoSummaryNet: A Deep Sets-based Approach for Improved Mechanism of Action Prediction in Image-based Cell Profiling

    Background: Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool for comparing perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. However, traditional methods of averaging across cells fail to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations.

    Research Question: Can a Deep Sets-based approach improve mechanism of action prediction in image-based cell profiling by aggregating single-cell feature data more effectively than traditional methods?

    Methods: We introduce CytoSummaryNet, a self-supervised contrastive learning approach that leverages the naturally available information in profiling experiments. CytoSummaryNet uses the Deep Sets formulation to learn a model that aggregates single-cell feature data into a profile that outperforms population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound’s mechanism of action.

    Main Findings: Our results show that CytoSummaryNet improves mechanism of action prediction by 30-68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells.

    Implications: CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets.

    Conclusions: CytoSummaryNet provides an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single-cell image feature data compared to previously published strategies and the average profiling baseline. The model likely achieves this by performing quality control, filtering out noisy cells and prioritizing high-quality data. Future research could explore CytoSummaryNet’s applicability to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics.

    **Title:** Quantifying Cognitive Effort in the Brain using Electroencephalography (EEG) Activation Patterns

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a framework to associate cognitive effort during task performance with electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns?

    **Methods:** We employed a stochastic control framework to measure brain transition costs in an existing EEG dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test that requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal a significant correlation between cognitive effort and brain transition costs, confirming the effectiveness of our framework in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. Specifically, we found an increased cost linked to cognitive effort during the Stroop task.

    **Implications:** This study provides a novel approach to physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain using EEG data. Our findings highlight the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes and offer insights into the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance.

    **Conclusions:** This research bridges the gap between existing methods for quantifying cognitive demand in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) data. By generalizing the stochastic control framework to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than fMRI, we provide a computational pipeline to quantify cognitive demand in EEG experiments. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach to describe neurophysiological data and provide a clear interpretation of transition costs, which can explain the variation in energy the brain needs to supply for differing cognitive demands. This study opens up fresh perspectives for understanding the neural basis of cognitive effort and has implications for the development of novel interventions to improve cognitive performance.

    **Title:** Expansion and Function of Atypical Memory B Cells in Protective Humoral Immune Responses to Plasmodium vivax Malaria

    **Research Question:** Do atypical memory B cells (aMBCs) play a role in producing protective antibodies against Plasmodium vivax malaria?

    **Methods:** We generated Plasmodium vivax Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBPII) probes to detect the development and durability of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs in malaria-exposed individuals. We used single MBC cultures (Nojima cultures) to demonstrate the function of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies.

    **Main Findings:** PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness and persisted through the recovery phase of infections. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. The B cell receptors (BCRs) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. The somatic hypermutation (SHM) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Plasmodium vivax infections elicit the development and persistence of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs, which may play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might contribute to the humoral immune response against malaria.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the protective role of aMBCs in humoral immune responses to malaria by differentiating into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) for producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against Plasmodium vivax invasion into human erythrocytes. Identifying MBC subsets or phenotypes that play a major role in producing protective antibodies will facilitate the development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines.

    **Title:** Polygenic Prediction of Complex Trait Phenotypes using mr. mash-rss: A Summary Data Approach

    **Background:** Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become increasingly important in human genetics, particularly in the context of precision medicine. Recent methods, such as mr. mash, have shown promise in modeling multiple phenotypes jointly and leveraging sharing of effects across phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy. However, these methods require individual-level data, which are often not publicly available due to privacy concerns.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop an extension of mr. mash that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel, making it applicable to data sets that are not publicly available and scalable to biobank-size data?

    **Methods:** We introduce mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that uses summary statistics from GWAS and LD estimates from a reference panel. We evaluate mr. mash-rss through simulations and real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios. We also demonstrate that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has a smaller sample size.

    **Implications:** mr. mash-rss addresses two important limitations of mr. mash: the need for individual-level data and the lack of scalability to biobank-size data. Our results suggest that mr. mash-rss is a valuable tool for polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes, particularly in scenarios where individual-level data are not available.

    **Conclusions:** We have introduced mr. mash-rss, a summary data version of the mr. mash model that leverages summary statistics from GWAS and LD estimates from a reference panel. Our results demonstrate that mr. mash-rss is a competitive and scalable method for polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes, making it a valuable tool for precision medicine and human genetics research.

    **Title:** Integrating Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity into Homogeneous Models for Improved Epidemic Prediction

    **Research Question:** Can a novel modelling framework that incorporates spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models improve the accuracy of epidemic predictions?

    **Methods:** We developed a Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model that approximates the recruitment rate of susceptibles using a neural network, and a mechanistic model with a pre-set specific form for the recruitment rate. We trained the UDE model using deep learning methods and calibrated the mechanistic model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with data from the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai, China.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations projected an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to the homogeneous model's projections of 99.97% and 32.78%. This represents an 18.6% improvement in prediction accuracy based on actual data. Our results also showed that heterogeneity in susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37.36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models can significantly improve the accuracy of epidemic predictions. This approach has the potential to inform public health decision-making and resource allocation during infectious disease outbreaks.

    **Conclusions:** This study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models that account for heterogeneity in susceptible populations. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatio-temporal heterogeneity in epidemic modelling and suggest that this approach can lead to more accurate predictions and better-informed decision-making. The proposed UDE model and mechanistic model can be applied to various infectious disease outbreaks, providing a valuable tool for public health professionals and policymakers.

    **Title:** Synaptic Noise as a Mechanism for Representing Uncertainty in Neural Dynamics

    **Research Question:** How do synapses in the brain utilize noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron?

    **Methods:** We developed a mathematical framework that models the synapse as an agent interacting with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics, which is updated by a synaptic learning rule resembling experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that synapses can exploit noisy synaptic transmission to encode their uncertainty about the somatic membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. We demonstrate that this enables a neuronal network to encode and utilize uncertainties in behaviorally ambiguous situations. Furthermore, our model predicts that synapses should be stochastic to effectively encode uncertainties about the somatic membrane potential, and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity changes in post-pre-post spike pairing protocols and the dependence on synaptic weight.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the functional role of noisy synaptic transmission in biological and artificial neuronal systems. We show that synapses can utilize their inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode their uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential, resolving different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment.

    **Conclusions:** In contrast to previous approaches, our model directly predicts that synapses should be stochastic to effectively encode uncertainties about the somatic membrane potential. We demonstrate that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network can resolve different learning problems by coordinating themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level. Our results provide a new perspective on the functional implications of noisy synaptic transmission, highlighting its potential as a feature rather than a bug in biological and artificial neuronal systems.

Background: Reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) data is crucial for understanding development, differentiation, and cancer progression. However, scDNA-seq data poses challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. To address these challenges, we developed Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method.

Research Question: Can Scuphr accurately reconstruct cell lineage trees from scDNA-seq data while accounting for common challenges associated with this data type?

Methods: Scuphr uses the neighbor-joining algorithm to compute distances between cell pairs and reconstruct the lineage tree. The method is designed to be embarrassingly parallel, allowing for faster analysis compared to state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated Scuphr using synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage tree topology.

Main Findings: Our results show that Scuphr outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy while achieving faster analysis times. The method's robustness is demonstrated through its ability to accurately reconstruct the lineage tree topology from scDNA-seq data despite the presence of allelic dropouts and amplification errors.

Implications: Scuphr's ability to accurately reconstruct cell lineage trees from scDNA-seq data has significant implications for understanding development, differentiation, and cancer progression. The method's robustness and speed make it a valuable tool for researchers working with scDNA-seq data.

Conclusions: We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method that addresses the challenges associated with scDNA-seq data. Our results demonstrate that Scuphr is a reliable and efficient tool for reconstructing cell lineage trees from scDNA-seq data, making it a valuable contribution to the field of computational biology. The method's ability to accurately reconstruct lineage trees from scDNA-seq data will facilitate a deeper understanding of cellular development, differentiation, and cancer progression.
Title: Evaluating Health Benefits Packages in Low-Income Settings: A Novel Approach Using the Thanzi La Onse (TLO) Model

    Abstract:
    In low-income settings, efficient allocation of limited resources is crucial for improving population health outcomes. Health benefits packages (HBPs) aim to determine which services the public healthcare system should provide. However, existing analytic approaches have limitations. We propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model as a tailored tool to evaluate Malawi-specific HBPs, addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modeling and calibrating to extensive country-specific data, we simulated the incidence of disease, health-seeking behavior, and healthcare system capacity under realistic constraints on human resources for health. Our results show that a linear constrained optimization analysis (LCOA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain (∼8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042) by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. However, this approach incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of implementation. Alternative prioritization approaches, such as service prioritization based on patient characteristics, achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period. Our findings suggest that the TLO simulation provides a unique tool for testing HBPs designed specifically for Malawi, offering detailed evaluations of health gains achievable through relative prioritization of services under realistic constraints in available human resources for health. This approach addresses limitations in other analytic methods commonly used to weigh evidence for different interventions, providing a balanced first step toward a realistic representation of resource constraints for the Malawian healthcare system.

    **Title:** Unveiling Novel Mechanisms of Meiotic Chromosome Segregation in Holocentric Species: A Comparative Study of Plodia interpunctella and Bombyx mori

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and how do they compare to those in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori?

    **Methods:** We employed Oligopaint DNA FISH technology to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in Plodia interpunctella and compared our findings to previous studies in Bombyx mori. We labeled single chromosomes at a time using stripe Oligopaints to quantify which chromosome region (arms or center) pairs first as cells progress through early meiotic prophase.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that meiotic homolog pairing in both Plodia and Bombyx is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. Both species form rod-shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple ways at metaphase I. We found that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes, regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Surprisingly, sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species, and four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I. Despite this, we found clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the classical view of segregation, where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. Instead, our results suggest that holocentric species employ a novel "center-kinetic" segregation mechanism, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology. Our findings in Plodia interpunctella and Bombyx mori provide new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome segregation in holocentric species, shedding light on the evolution of meiotic processes across species.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Sox3 in the median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus during post-natal development, and how does its absence affect pituitary maturation and NG2-glia renewal?

    **Methods:** We used conditional gene deletion and low-dose aspirin treatment to investigate the effects of Sox3 loss on NG2-glia renewal and pituitary maturation in mice. We also examined the impact of changes in the gut microbiome on hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Sox3 is predominantly expressed in the median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus, and its absence affects NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential. We observed a correlation between reduced hormone levels in the pituitary and a lack of endocrine cell maturation. Low-dose aspirin treatment and changes in the gut microbiome rescued both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation. We propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that Sox3 plays a crucial role in regulating NG2-glia renewal and pituitary maturation in the ME during post-natal development. The rescue of hypopituitarism by low-dose aspirin treatment and changes in the gut microbiome indicates that NG2-glia are sensitive to extrinsic signals and that their dysfunction can be modified by non-genetic factors. Our study provides new insights into the etiology of hypopituitarism and highlights the importance of NG2-glia in the development of the ME and pituitary gland.

    **Title:** Coordinated Activation and Inhibition of F-actin by CED-5/CED-12 during Embryonic Morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What is the role of CED-5/CED-12 in regulating F-actin during embryonic morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of CED-5/CED-12, a two-component Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), in regulating F-actin during embryonic morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. We used genetic and expression studies to examine the effects of CED-5/CED-12 mutations on embryonic cell migrations and F-actin levels.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to our expectations, we found that CED-5/CED-12 promotes embryonic migrations, but inhibits F-actin in the migrating epidermis. Furthermore, we discovered that CED-12 harbors a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) function, which acts on different GTPases to regulate F-actin nucleation. Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region (R537A) altered the epidermal cell migration function, but not the corpse engulfment function. Interfering with GEF function by mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that CED-5/CED-12 supports the cycling of multiple GTPases, using distinct domains, to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation during embryonic morphogenesis. This coordinated regulation of F-actin is essential for proper embryonic development, as loss of CED-5/CED-12 function leads to failed epidermal cell migrations and embryonic lethality.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a previously undescribed role for CED-5 and CED-12 in regulating F-actin during embryonic morphogenesis, and highlights the complexity of GEF function in promoting and inhibiting F-actin formation. These findings have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying embryonic development and the regulation of F-actin in diseases such as cancer.

    **Title:** Hierarchical Temporal Processing in the Rodent Visual System: Unveiling the Role of Intrinsic Mechanisms

    **Research Question:** How does the rodent visual system process information across various timescales, and what role do intrinsic mechanisms play in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to investigate the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual system under visual stimulation. We recorded spike activity from the rodent visual system and analyzed the information- and correlation timescales, as well as the predictability of neural activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity also displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We reproduced these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms, such as recurrent coupling, to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. This indicates that the neural code is not solely based on stimulus encoding and complex feature representations, but also relies on network-intrinsic mechanisms to shape the temporal processing hierarchy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system, where intrinsic mechanisms play a crucial role in achieving longer integration for higher cortical areas. Our results have implications for understanding the neural code and the role of intrinsic mechanisms in processing information across various timescales. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the neural basis of perception and cognition, and have potential applications in the development of more efficient neural networks and brain-inspired computing architectures.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Neural Circuits Engaged by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Computational Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the motor cortex, and how do they contribute to the generation of corticospinal waves?

    **Methods:** This study employed epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways.

    **Main Findings:** The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves, with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of both afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves. The conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Moreover, multiple neuron type activations could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave.

    **Implications:** This study provides new insights into the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, which has broad potential for new applications in neuropsychiatric disorders. The results suggest that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves, and that activation of both afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiate different I-waves.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of using computational modeling and machine learning to identify and understand the mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure. The findings have implications for the development of new treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders and highlight the importance of understanding the neural circuits engaged by TMS.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Biology of Cell-Free Placental DNA: Current Knowledge and Future Directions

    **Research Question:** What is the current understanding of cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) in maternal circulation during gestation, and what are the implications for research and clinical applications?

    **Methods:** A comprehensive review of existing literature was conducted to examine the origins, molecular characteristics, and clinical applications of cfpDNA.

    **Main Findings:** Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is shed into maternal circulation throughout pregnancy, comprising up to 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA. CfpDNA has been used in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations, including chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility.

    **Implications:** Directing more attention to studying cfpDNA will improve our understanding of placental physiological processes, the functional role of cfpDNA in pregnancy, and how cfpDNA can be leveraged to study and monitor placental health and disease. CfpDNA is representative of the full placental genome, providing a means for noninvasive genome-wide characterization of the placenta.

    **Conclusions:** While cfpDNA has been widely implemented in the clinical setting for NIPT, its potential as a research tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease remains underexplored. The distinction between cell-free "fetal" DNA and cell-free "placental" DNA is crucial, especially when discussing clinical applications of cfpDNA. Future research directions should focus on elucidating the origins and molecular characteristics of cfpDNA, as well as its functional role in pregnancy. This will open avenues for many more clinical applications of cfpDNA beyond the current NIPT repertoire, which is limited to genetic screening of the fetus. By advancing our understanding of cfpDNA, we can unlock its full potential as a research and clinical tool for improving maternal and fetal health outcomes.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Shared Genetic Architecture of Hormone-Dependent Cancers: A Genome-Wide Association Study

    **Background:** Hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers, account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year. These cancers share several environmental, behavioral, and genetic risk factors, suggesting a common etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs.

    **Research Question:** Can we identify common target genes driving the shared genetic architecture of HDCs?

    **Methods:** We integrated GWAS data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models to annotate 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. We extended the variants of each HDC by 0.5 Mb on either side, resulting in cancer-specific risk regions.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs. These regions were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. We also pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factor motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC.

    **Conclusions:** This study expands the repertoire of risk regions and candidate risk genes for HDCs, providing further insights into the complex genetic architecture and biology underpinning HDC susceptibility. The identification of lncRNAs as potential HDC targets highlights the importance of non-coding RNAs in cancer biology. Our findings have implications for the development of targeted therapies and the repurposing of existing treatments for HDCs.

    **Title:** Identification of a Deletion in the IL21/IL2 Locus Associated with Polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker Dog Breed

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular genetic basis of polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog breed?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33 cases and 106 controls to identify genetic variants associated with polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog breed. We also performed haplotype analysis, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of genomic DNA, and targeted resequencing of the IL21/IL2 locus in 8 affected and 4 control dogs.

    **Main Findings:** Our GWAS analysis identified a significant association between polymyositis and a region on chromosome CFA19 (p = 4.7*10−10). Haplotype analysis revealed that affected dogs shared a 2.9 Mb region in the homozygous or heterozygous state. NGS of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment located 10 kb upstream of the IL21 and IL2 genes. The frequency of the deletion allele was significantly higher in affected dogs (0.81) compared to a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed (0.25). Leukocytes from affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment, located 10-49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus, is a risk factor for polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog breed. We propose that elements located upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements leads to overexpression of IL21 and IL2, contributing to the development of polymyositis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of the IL21/IL2 locus in polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog breed. The identification of the 39 kb deletion as a risk factor for the disease provides a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high-risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed. Furthermore, our findings suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 may also be important for human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region.

    **Title:** Large-Scale Protein Stability Prediction using a Fine-Tuned Protein Language Model

    **Research Question:** Can a protein language model be optimized for stability prediction, enabling rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations?

    **Methods:** We developed ESMtherm, a protein language model trained on a mega-scale dataset of 528,000 natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains. The model can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We fine-tuned ESMtherm on the folding stability of small protein domains and evaluated its performance on sequences distal from the training set.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ESMtherm performs reasonably well on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. We also demonstrate that training on an ensemble of protein domains, rather than mutagenesis studies of a single domain, improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein language model for folding stability prediction. Furthermore, our results highlight the benefits of training collectively on all protein sequences instead of mutagenesis studies on a single wildtype.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates the potential of protein language models for folding stability prediction, enabled by large-scale protein stability measurements. The fine-tuned ESMtherm model generalizes successfully to protein domains distal from the training set, showing the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. Our results also highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature.

    **Conclusions:** While ESMtherm performs comparably with state-of-the-art models on small protein sequences, its performance on larger protein scaffolds lags behind. However, our results suggest that a folding stability dataset of larger proteins might be vital to improving the generalizability of ESMtherm. Our study highlights the potential of protein language models for folding stability prediction and underscores the importance of large-scale stability measurements for improving the accuracy and generalizability of these models.

    **Title:** Inhibitory Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-Like Receptors Regulate CD4+ T Cell Responses in Type 1 Diabetes

    **Research Question:** Do inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) modulate CD4+ T cell responses in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity?

    **Methods:** We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset (N = 11,961) to investigate the interaction between iKIR genes and Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, which explain up to 50% of the genetic risk in T1D.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a significant and consistent effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations in T1D. This effect was validated in an independent dataset.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D, which is consistent with the role of iKIRs in modulating adaptive immune responses in chronic viral infections. This implies that iKIRs may play a crucial role in preventing autoimmunity by suppressing autoreactive T cell responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that iKIRs have a significant impact on HLA class II genetic associations in T1D, suggesting that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in this autoimmune disease. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity and highlight the potential of iKIRs as a therapeutic target for preventing or treating T1D. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms by which iKIRs modulate CD4+ T cell responses and to investigate whether similar modifications are seen in other autoimmune diseases.

    **Significance:** This study provides new insights into the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity and highlights the potential of iKIRs as a therapeutic target for preventing or treating T1D. The findings also suggest that iKIRs may play a crucial role in preventing autoimmunity by suppressing autoreactive T cell responses, which has important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of T1D and other autoimmune diseases.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy: A Comprehensive Analysis of CTG18.1 Expansion-Driven Pathophysiology

    Abstract:
    Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly, characterized by the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element (CTG18.1) within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. Despite its prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying FECD remain poorly understood due to the non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells (CECs) from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18.1-expanded (Exp+) and CTG18.1-independent (Exp-) FECD.

    Methods:
    We employed long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers in Exp+ and Exp- FECD CECs. Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data revealed the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD and unique transcripts associated with CTG18.1 expansions. Differential gene expression analysis highlighted the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. Furthermore, differential exon usage, pathway enrichment, and spatial transcriptomics revealed TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences.

    Main Findings:
    Our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. We identified rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants in 7/134 Exp- FECD cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18.1 may increase FECD risk. Spatial transcriptomics revealed TCF4 isoform dysregulation at the TCF4 transcript level and potential downstream effects of the isoform-specific pattern of TCF4 dysregulation.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for the development of translational interventions for FECD. The identification of RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation as distinct pathogenic mechanisms provides a framework for the development of targeted therapies. Furthermore, the discovery of rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants in Exp- FECD cases highlights the importance of considering TCF4 variants as a risk factor for FECD.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying FECD, shedding light on the complex interplay between CTG18.1 expansions and TCF4 dysregulation. Our findings support the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, and underscore the importance of considering TCF4 variants as a risk factor for FECD.

    **Title:** Identification of GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h (GF14h) as a Key Regulator of Low-Temperature Germination in Rice (Oryza sativa)

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LTG) in rice (Oryza sativa) and how can it be improved for direct seeding in cold climates?

    **Methods:** We employed QTL-seq to identify the quantitative trait locus (QTL) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra, which exhibits rapid seed germination at lower temperatures. We then delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h (GF14h) gene, which is expressed during seed germination.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h, whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding.

    **Implications:** The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions. We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h, which showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that GF14h is a key regulator of LTG in rice. We suggest that GF14h controls LTG by interacting with various phytohormone signaling pathways. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra can be used to improve LTG in rice varieties, enabling direct seeding in cold climates. Our findings have significant implications for rice breeding and cultivation in regions with cold temperatures.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Terminal Redundancy in Hepatitis B Virus Replication and Covalently Closed Circular DNA Formation

    Abstract:
    Hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) harbors an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative strand DNA, derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). However, the structure and fate of TR during HBV replication and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) formation remain unclear. To address these questions, we generated a mutant HBV cell line, HepDES-C1822G, with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the 3’ TR of the negative strand DNA while maintaining the wild-type (wt) 5’ TR. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed that the positive strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of the negative strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. We further demonstrated that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1. Additionally, we mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses. Our findings suggest that the putative 5’ and 3’ flaps formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursors. These results provide new insights into HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the HBV replication cycle.

    Research Question:
    What is the structure and fate of the terminal redundancy (TR) in HBV relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) during replication and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) formation?

    Methods:
    We generated a mutant HBV cell line, HepDES-C1822G, with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the 3’ TR of the negative strand DNA while maintaining the wild-type (wt) 5’ TR. We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis to investigate the TR selection of HBV (-) strand DNA during rcDNA and cccDNA biosynthesis.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the 5’ TR of the negative strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. We also demonstrated that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the HBV replication cycle. The dynamic interchangeability of the putative 5’ and 3’ flaps formed by TR on rcDNA precursors highlights the complexity of HBV replication and cccDNA formation.

    Conclusions:
    Our study elucidates the structure and fate of TR in HBV rcDNA during replication and cccDNA formation, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying HBV replication. The identification of Mus81 and FEN1 as critical enzymes in cccDNA formation highlights the importance of these enzymes in the HBV replication cycle.

    **Title:** Metabolic Cross-Feeding Shapes Microbial Community Structure in Microbial Fuel Cells Treating Sulfide-Containing Wastewater

    **Research Question:** How do changes in organic loading rates (OLRs) influence the microbial community structure and metabolic interactions in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory?

    **Methods:** A microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) was developed to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs under varying OLRs. The model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB).

    **Main Findings:** Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as OLRs increased, accompanied by a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs (L-OLRs) and adaptation to high OLRs (H-OLRs). Simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide (S) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. Cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance.

    **Implications:** The study highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.

    **Conclusions:** This work demonstrates the significance of metabolic cross-feeding in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater. The mmGEM provided a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic metabolic interactions within microbial communities in MFCs, ultimately enhancing our knowledge of microbial ecology and facilitating the optimization of MFC performance for various biotechnological applications. The study's findings have practical implications for the implementation of MFC technology in industrial settings, particularly in the treatment of sulfide-containing wastewater.

**Title:** CPEC: A Machine Learning Framework for FDR-Controlled Biological Discovery

**Research Question:** Can we develop a machine learning (ML) framework that integrates uncertainty quantification to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in biological discovery applications, such as enzyme function annotation?

**Methods:** We propose CPEC, an ML framework that leverages the conformal prediction framework to achieve FDR-controlled enzyme function prediction. CPEC integrates a deep learning model, PenLight2, with conformal prediction to provide accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme.

**Main Findings:** Our evaluation experiments demonstrate that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. CPEC allows users to specify their desired FDR tolerance α, tailored to the experiment budget or goals, and makes corresponding predictions with a controlled FDR.

**Implications:** Our results show that CPEC is a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited. By controlling the FDR, CPEC reduces the risk of misdirecting experimental efforts and resources to the validation of false positive hypotheses, ensuring the efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted biological discovery.

**Conclusions:** CPEC addresses a significant challenge in ML-assisted biological discoveries by providing a framework for FDR-controlled predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CPEC in enzyme function annotation, a case study that simulates the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. We expect CPEC to be a valuable tool for various biological discovery applications, including drug discovery, where ML models are used to predict the properties of molecules and identify promising candidates for downstream experimental validation.

    **Title:** Hsp90 Chaperone Activity Contributes to Adverse Outcomes in TDP-43 Proteinopathies in Vivo

    **Research Question:** Does the heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 contribute to neurotoxicity in TDP-43 proteinopathies, a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?

    **Methods:** We employed a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of familial inherited ALS (fALS) mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy to investigate the role of Hsp90 in TDP-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.

    **Main Findings:** We found that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult C. elegans animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. Furthermore, we observed that Hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16.1, and that normal levels of hsp-16.1 are required for Hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43.

    **Implications:** Our data demonstrate that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS. These findings suggest that Hsp90 inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating ALS.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first evidence that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to TDP-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in a whole animal model of ALS. Our results highlight the importance of Hsp90 in modulating TDP-43 misfolding and toxicity, and suggest that Hsp90 inhibition may be a viable therapeutic approach for treating ALS. Future studies are needed to further investigate the role of Hsp90 in ALS and to explore the potential of Hsp90 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Pathways of Oogenesis in Artemia franciscana: A Single-Nucleus Atlas of the Female Reproductive System

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system, and to what extent are they conserved across distantly related species?

    **Methods:** We employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) to generate a comprehensive single-nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system. We mapped our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary to shed light on conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species.

    **Main Findings:** Our study identified the major cell types present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells. We also explored gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. Furthermore, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to resolve the cellular complexity of the Artemia ovary, identifying clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns that share different levels of expression-based homology with the Drosophila ovarian clusters.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved between Artemia and Drosophila, despite their ~505 million years of evolutionary divergence. This study highlights the utility of single-nucleus RNA sequencing as an alternative to traditional approaches for identifying promising models for the study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate/identify nuclei of meiotic cells.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus atlas of the Artemia ovary, shedding light on the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and conservation of reproductive biology across distantly related species, and highlight the potential of single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a powerful tool for studying meiotic sex chromosome regulation.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Mechanisms of Allodynia: A Biophysically-Motivated Model of Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance in Dorsal Horn Neural Circuits

    **Research Question:** What are the biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn, and how do they contribute to the development of allodynia, a debilitating symptom of chronic pain?

    **Methods:** We used neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. We then implemented a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) signaling.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling, allowing excitatory neurons to escape inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses, releasing excitatory neurons from inhibitory control. The subcircuit components involved in the mechanism and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure.

    **Implications:** These findings provide specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.

    **Conclusions:** Our biophysically-motivated model of dorsal horn neural circuits provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions among multiple interneuron populations that maintain E-I balance in healthy conditions and its disruption in allodynia. The identification of multiple mechanisms underlying allodynia suggests that successful treatment of chronic pain conditions requires a full understanding of the underlying physiological causes, including the dysregulation of E-I balance in dorsal horn circuitry. Our results highlight the importance of considering the complexity of dorsal horn circuitry in the development of effective treatments for allodynia.

    **Title:** Distinct Roles of Hsp90 and Cochaperones in Regulating Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 (eEF2) Function

    **Research Question:** How do Hsp90 and cochaperones contribute to the accurate translation and folding of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a critical protein involved in ribosome translocation?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of Hsp90 and cochaperones (Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7) in regulating eEF2 function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We examined the effects of Hsp90 and cochaperone mutations on eEF2 steady-state levels, growth, and sensitivity to diphtheria toxin.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Mutations in one group of Hsp90 or cochaperone genes reduced eEF2 steady-state levels, while mutations in another group altered eEF2 sensitivity to diphtheria toxin. Notably, yeast expressing Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation were negatively impacted by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1, a cochaperone that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with Hsp90 or the TRiC chaperone. Furthermore, mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1, and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not only by assisting protein folding but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. Moreover, our results suggest that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones, indicating that there may be distinct versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the complex and multifaceted role of Hsp90 and cochaperones in regulating eEF2 function, a critical protein involved in ribosome translocation. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of Hsp90 function and the development of selective inhibitors with fewer negative effects. Further studies are required to better understand the interaction of Hgh1 and eEF2 with TRiC and Hsp90 and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the distinct roles of Hsp90 and cochaperones in regulating eEF2 function.

    **Title:** Social Conformity as a Heuristic for Risky Decision-Making in Social Contexts

    **Research Question:** How do individuals make decisions in social contexts when their utility-based risk processing is disrupted or inaccessible, such as in cases of cognitive impairment or novel options?

    **Methods:** We investigated this question using a gambling task where participants with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) made choices both alone and after observing others' choices. We compared their performance to a control group.

    **Main Findings:** Participants with lesions in the insular or dACC showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. However, when making socially situated decisions, they exhibited increased conformity with the choices of others, independent of social utility-based computations. This suggests that following others' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making in social contexts when utility-based risk processing is disrupted.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding how individuals make decisions in social contexts, particularly when their risk processing is impaired. We propose that social conformity can serve as a heuristic alternative to using social information in a utility-based way during socially situated decision-making.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively less demanding heuristics that facilitates decisions about risky options in a social context. Specifically, we found a parametric relationship between the degree of impairment in utility-based risky decision-making and the use of the 'follow others' choices' heuristic. Individuals whose utility-based risky decision-making was most disrupted conformed the most with the choices of others. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample of control participants, providing convergent evidence supporting the notion that social conformity can serve as a heuristic for decision-making in social contexts when utility-based risk processing is disrupted.

    **Title:** Phenotype Bias in Biomorphs: Unveiling the Role of Developmental Bias in Adaptive Evolution

    **Research Question:** Do biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, exhibit phenotype bias, where certain phenotypes are more likely to appear through random mutations, and if so, how does this bias influence adaptive evolutionary outcomes?

    **Methods:** We employed population genetics simulations to investigate the generation of phenotypic variation in biomorphs and tested the hypothesis that these systems exhibit simplicity bias, a type of developmental bias favoring simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that biomorphs indeed exhibit phenotype bias, with a strong preference for simpler phenotypes that are many orders of magnitude more likely to appear through random mutations. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, which can be intuitively understood as evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. We also found that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of adaptive evolution, as they suggest that developmental bias can play a crucial role in shaping evolutionary outcomes. Moreover, the patterns observed in biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that biomorphs, a simplified model of morphological development, exhibit simplicity bias and other phenomena similar to those observed in molecular systems. We postulate that this bias may hold more widely for developmental systems, and that further research is needed to explore the conditions under which sequence-constraint-based models provide a useful first approximation. Our results also highlight the importance of considering the interplay between random mutations and phenotypic correlations in incremental adaptive evolution.

    **Title:** Human Sensitivity to Resonance in Nonlinear Systems: A User Study on Virtual Double Pendula

    **Research Question:** Can humans intuitively tune to and excite resonant motions in nonlinear systems, specifically in virtual double pendula with joint compliance?

    **Methods:** A user study consisting of three experiment parts was conducted, where participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the numerically predicted nonlinear normal modes (NNM) of the energy-conservative systems (Experiments 1 and 2) or purposefully arranged offset (Experiment 3).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems in all tested experiment variations. Even for increased task accuracy (Experiment 2) and targets located away from the NNM (Experiment 3), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task.

    **Implications:** Our findings extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems, highlighting the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that humans are indeed sensitive to resonance in nonlinear systems and can intuitively excite and stabilize a system close to its NNM, even in complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. Our results suggest that humans can adapt their control strategies to align the resonant motions with the task requirements, and that muscle stiffness may play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of the system. These findings have implications for the development of human-centered control strategies in robotics and other fields where humans interact with complex dynamic systems.

    Title: **Regulation of Pulcherrimin Biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: A Complex Interplay of Transition State Regulators and MarR-Family Transcription Factor**

    **Research Question:** How do transition state regulators (TSRs) and the MarR-family transcription factor PchR regulate pulcherrimin biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis during the transition from exponential to stationary phase?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic analysis, biochemical assays, and in vitro DNA binding experiments to investigate the regulation of pulcherrimin biosynthesis in B. subtilis. Specifically, we examined the roles of two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, and the MarR-family transcription factor PchR in regulating the expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR collectively repress pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. Genetic analysis revealed that all three transcription factors are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production, and expression of yvmC is under the control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR. Biochemical analysis showed that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates, indicating a layered regulation of pulcherrimin biosynthesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the regulatory network of pulcherrimin production in B. subtilis, highlighting the complex interplay between TSRs and the MarR-family transcription factor PchR. The results suggest that pulcherrimin biosynthesis is tightly regulated and repressed during exponential growth by two distinct regulatory systems, underscoring the importance of pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology.

    **Conclusions:** Our study establishes a model where pulcherrimin biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase, in addition to input from PchR, linking stationary phase with extracellular iron sequestration. The presence of the three repressors is necessary to limit the production of pulcherrimin, providing a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying pulcherrimin biosynthesis in B. subtilis.

    **Title:** Computational Modeling of Bladder Function after Spinal Cord Injury and the Effects of Transcutaneous Magnetic Stimulation

    **Research Question:** What are the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a spinal cord injury (SCI), and how can transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) improve bladder function in patients with SCI?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations, which replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI. We then incorporated the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI.

    **Main Findings:** Our model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. We found that low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage. Our results suggest that neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a basic framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and the effects of TMS on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction following SCI. The model can be used to explore how SCI may alter control of micturition and how spinal cord stimulation may ameliorate control of bladder function.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the importance of neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons in replicating the effects of SCI on control of micturition. The computational model developed in this study provides a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of bladder dysfunction after SCI and the effects of TMS, and can inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for patients with SCI.
Title: A Novel Mathematical Model for Estimating Morphology-Specific Fungal Growth Rates from Indirect Optical Density Data

    Abstract:

    Background: Accurate quantification of fungal growth is crucial for the effective treatment of severe fungal infections. Current methods rely on time-course morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length measurements, which are often impractical for large-scale collection in clinical microbiology laboratories.

    Research Question: Can a mathematical model be developed to estimate morphology-specific fungal growth rates from indirect optical density (OD600) data, without the need for calibration data?

    Methods: We proposed a novel mathematical model that treats measured OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration. This model explicitly includes calibration in the model structure, allowing for the estimation of morphology-specific growth rates from indirect OD600 data.

    Main Findings: Our model outperformed reference models in fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves for Aspergillus fumigatus, a filamentous fungus. The estimated morphology-specific growth rates from our model were more accurate than those obtained from directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration.

    Implications: This study provides a novel approach for estimating morphology-specific fungal growth rates from indirect OD600 data, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data. Our model does not require the collection of calibration data, reducing the complexity and cost associated with traditional methods.

    Conclusions: The proposed mathematical model offers a reliable and efficient method for estimating morphology-specific fungal growth rates from indirect OD600 data, overcoming the limitations of current methods. This breakthrough has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections, enabling clinicians to make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.

    **Title:** Reconstructing Karyotype Evolution in Beetles: A Novel Model for Understanding Sex Chromosome Evolution

    **Research Question:** How do sex chromosomes evolve in beetles, a species-rich group with diverse karyotypes?

    **Methods:** We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, a beetle with a neo-sex chromosome, and analyzed eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. We identified ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share a conserved set of genes across beetles.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that the ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beetles, but we find independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes, resulting in the formation of neo-sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes evolve the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that beetles provide a novel model to study the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution. The conservation of ancestral linkage groups across beetles allows for the study of karyotype evolution at the molecular level, making Coleoptera a valuable model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces driving the differentiation of sex chromosomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of sex chromosomes in beetles and highlights the importance of comparative analysis to address the prevalence of these patterns and the evolutionary forces driving them across species. The abundance of beetles and the development of genomic and functional tools make Coleoptera an ideal model system for studying sex chromosome evolution. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of sex chromosomes in other organisms and shed light on the diverse forces driving the differentiation of sex chromosomes across taxa.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of H2A.Z in Gene Expression Regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under DNA Replication Stress

    **Research Question:** How does the incorporation of H2A.Z, a histone variant encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene, modulate chromatin structure and DNA accessibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under DNA replication stress conditions?

    **Methods:** We generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (HU), which induces DNA replication stress. We analyzed six biological replicates to examine the effects of H2A.Z incorporation on gene expression.

    **Main Findings:** Our data revealed that H2A.Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was essential for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that apo-SWR1-C, the catalytic subunit of the SWR1-complex, contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, mapping H2A.Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU showed that decreases in H2A.Z enrichment at transcription start sites were correlated with, but not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the regulatory effects of H2A.Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to DNA replication stress. The findings suggest that H2A.Z plays a crucial role in gene activation, particularly during stress conditions, and that apo-SWR1-C can contribute to gene expression defects in the absence of H2A.Z.

    **Conclusions:** This study characterizes the regulatory effects of H2A.Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU exposure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results highlight the importance of considering the additive effects of apo-SWR1-C on transcript profiles when examining the role of H2A.Z in gene expression regulation. The findings provide new avenues for understanding the complex relationship between H2A.Z, SWR1-C, and gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

    **Title:** Automated Classification of Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiles using Partial Label Learning Strategies

    **Background:** Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) has revolutionized our understanding of developmental biology. However, annotating transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into cell types and identifying lineage relationships remains a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality of the data and the difficulty of obtaining fully annotated datasets.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop automated classification methods that can accurately classify single-cell transcriptomic profiles into cell types using partially annotated datasets?

    **Methods:** We propose a partial label learning framework, which assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point. We extend state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression, and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. We also study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods, particularly the hierarchical structure of the labels commonly observed in developmental processes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data. We also study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods.

    **Implications:** Our findings show that hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles. These methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods, making transcriptomic single-cell data annotation easier and more routinely used to interrogate the nature of the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation.

    **Conclusion:** The flexibility and adaptability of the partial label learning framework is a key step in making transcriptomic single-cell data annotation easier and the corresponding prediction even more routinely used to interrogate the nature of the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation. Our results have significant implications for the field of developmental biology and highlight the potential of partial label learning strategies for automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles.

    **Title:** RNA-Dependent Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Bisphosphate (PIP2) Associates with Proteins to Establish Nuclear Architecture

    **Research Question:** What is the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli, and how does it interact with RNA to establish nuclear architecture?

    **Methods:** We employed mass spectrometry to identify the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated (RDPA) nuclear proteome in human cells. We used a GST-PLCδ1 PH domain-based approach to determine the PIP2-containing nuclear structures associated with protein complexes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. These IDRs exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. Notably, we found that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins, affecting their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This implies a pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge via RNA association to attract and retain different sets of RDPA proteins, thereby influencing nuclear architecture. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the real biological implications of this phenomenon and highlights the importance of PIP2 in the interplay between RNA and nuclear architecture. The experimental pipeline developed in this study can be applied to other nuclear lipid-protein interactors, shedding light on the complex relationships between PIP2, RNA, and nuclear architecture.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Genomic Mechanisms of Phenotypic Plasticity in Dung Beetles: A Comparative Genomic and Developmental Analysis

    **Research Question:** What are the genomic mechanisms underlying the development and evolution of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, particularly in the context of nutrition-responsive traits such as cephalic horns?

    **Methods:** We generated chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species (Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella) and compared them to seven other species across the order Coleoptera. We also performed chromatin accessibility assays in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females to identify cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- and sex-responsive development.

    **Main Findings:** Our comparative genomic analysis revealed evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We identified distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development, including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination. Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors were enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits. We demonstrate that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provide new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the genomic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, shedding light on the evolution of nutrition-responsive traits such as cephalic horns. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of developmental plasticity and the role of chromatin architecture in regulating conditional responses in trait formation.
Title: Elucidating the Pathogenesis of Lassa Fever: A Comparative Study of Viral Dynamics and Immune Response in a Cynomolgus Monkey Model

    Abstract:
    Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), remains poorly understood in terms of its pathogenesis, particularly the mechanisms underlying the transition from acute infection to catastrophic illness and death. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a cynomolgus monkey model of LASV infection to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Our study reveals that lymphoid organs serve as an early major reservoir for replicating virus, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies significantly with disease severity, with nonfatal Lassa fever characterized by limited viral dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells, whereas fatal Lassa fever is marked by systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types, accompanied by an excessive inflammatory response. These findings provide new insights into the early viral dynamics and host response to LASV infection, shedding light on the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with different disease outcomes.

    Methods:
    We utilized a cynomolgus monkey model of LASV infection, which reproduces the different outcomes of Lassa fever observed in humans. Animals were infected with the Josiah and AV strains of LASV at the same dose and via the same route of inoculation, leading to uniformly fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. Histological and transcriptomic studies were performed to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies significantly with disease severity, with nonfatal Lassa fever characterized by limited viral dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells, whereas fatal Lassa fever is marked by systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types, accompanied by an excessive inflammatory response.

    Implications:
    These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with different disease outcomes. The identification of lymphoid organs as an early major reservoir for replicating virus provides new insights into the early stages of LASV infection, while the observed differences in viral tropism and immune response between fatal and nonfatal Lassa fever highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between the virus and the host immune system.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with different disease outcomes. The cynomolgus monkey model of LASV infection used in this study offers a valuable tool for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the transition from acute infection to catastrophic illness and death, ultimately contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of Lassa fever.

    **Title:** Upstream Causal Role of Importin-β Nuclear Transport Defects in Neurodegenerative Diseases

    **Background:** Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) disruptions, including the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins, nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, have been observed in various neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (FTD/FTLD), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). However, the primary cause of these disruptions remains unclear.

    **Research Question:** Do Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases?

    **Methods:** We generated two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration (NemfR86S and NemfR487G) that recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. We used these models to investigate the role of Importin-β nuclear import in disease onset.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals four key findings: (1) Importin-β-specific nuclear import block in NemfR86S and NemfR487G mouse models; (2) cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran; (3) pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations; and (4) similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Importin-β nuclear import defects may be a primary upstream cause of multiple proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin-β nuclear import. These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function.

    **Title:** Temporal Modulation of Phage Epigenome Enhances CRISPR-Cas-Mediated Mutagenesis Efficiency

    **Research Question:** How can the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas-mediated phage mutagenesis be improved in the presence of extensive DNA modifications, such as cytosine glycosylation, that hinder Cas-mediated cleavage?

    **Methods:** We employed the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET, a ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase, to temporarily reduce the abundance of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) within the phage T4 genome. This allowed for the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas, facilitating the introduction of point mutations into the phage genome in a scarless manner.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that DNA modifications protect the genome of phage T4 from nucleolytic cleavage by Cas12, enabling efficient phage lysis. We observed a delay of approximately 250 minutes in lysis when infecting E. coli expressing CRISPR-Cas12_Alt with NgTET-treated T4 compared to wild-type T4. Furthermore, we successfully introduced point mutations into two specific T4 phage ADP-ribosyltransferases, modA and alt, crucial for phage infection.

    **Implications:** Our study presents a novel approach for precise, site-specific phage mutagenesis based on temporarily reducing phage DNA modifications. This enhances DNA accessibility for Cas nucleases, boosting the efficiency of phage DNA double-strand breaks, the first and essential step of CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis. The scarless nature of this approach allows for the precise study of the impact of introduced mutations on phage infection without the side effects associated with gene deletion or reporter gene insertion.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings propose an efficient strategy for introducing point mutations into genomes of lytic phages that possess cytosine-based DNA modifications. This approach enables the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlines the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants.

    **Title:** Histone Variant H2A.Z Plays a Crucial Role in Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair and Genome Stability upon UV Irradiation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of histone variant H2A.Z in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and genome stability following UV irradiation?

    **Methods:** Using a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified histone variant H2A.Z as an important component in safeguarding transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that in the absence of H2A.Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Our results support a role for H2A.Z in the regulation of RNA polymerase II occupancy and TC-NER repair efficiency upon UV irradiation.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the significance of DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability. The accumulation of double-strand breaks in H2A.Z-depleted cells constitutes a major threat to genome stability, underscoring the importance of H2A.Z in preventing UV-induced DNA damage.

    **Conclusions:** Our study identifies histone variant H2A.Z as a new player in TC-NER and demonstrates its essential role in maintaining genome stability upon UV irradiation. The conservation of H2A.Z from yeast to human suggests that this histone variant plays a conserved function in DNA repair and genome stability across eukaryotes. Our results have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of DNA repair and genome stability, and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling complexes in maintaining genome integrity.

    **Significance:** This study provides new insights into the role of histone variants in DNA repair and genome stability, and highlights the importance of chromatin remodeling complexes in maintaining genome integrity. The identification of H2A.Z as a key player in TC-NER and genome stability upon UV irradiation has significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of DNA repair and genome stability in eukaryotes.

    **Research Question:** How does genetic variation affect the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence in Drosophila melanogaster?

    **Methods:** We analyzed gene expression and microbiome composition in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule of four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the derived, European range and one from the ancestral, African range.

    **Main Findings:** We detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects on gene expression and microbiome composition. Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects, although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele-specific expression revealed that trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, and the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies. We demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the complexity of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution. Our results suggest that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence, providing new insights into the evolution of regulatory architecture in Drosophila melanogaster. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of complex traits and the role of regulatory variation in shaping phenotypic diversity.

    **Title:** Estimating the Delay from First Infection to the Nth Case: A Population Dynamics Approach to Dating Emerging Epidemics

    **Research Question:** What is the delay from the first SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded, and how can this information be used to date the emergence of emerging epidemics?

    **Methods:** We developed a population dynamics-based modeling framework to estimate the delay from the first SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded. We validated our framework using simulated data and applied it to two case studies: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that the median delay from the first SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded is approximately 52 days (95% interpercentile range: 41-78 days). Using this information, we dated the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK at August 21, 2020 (95% interpercentile range: July 23-September 5, 2020) and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at November 28, 2019 (95% interpercentile range: November 2-December 9, 2019).

    **Implications:** Our population dynamics-based modeling framework provides a novel approach to estimating the delay from the first infection to the Nth case, which is essential for understanding the early stages of emerging epidemics. This information can be used to date the emergence of outbreaks and estimate the proportion of the epidemic that remains undetected.

    **Conclusions:** Our results are consistent with previous studies that used genomic data to estimate the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty of our approach lies in its exclusive use of population dynamics, which provides a flexible and generic framework that can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in various contexts. Our findings highlight the importance of quantifying the time that emerging epidemics remain undetected before detecting the first cases, particularly for emergent pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Homolog Pairing during Meiosis: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How do homologous chromosomes pair during meiosis in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes, and what are the key factors contributing to this process?

    **Methods:** We developed an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble during meiotic prophase I. The model incorporates unidirectional chromosome movements, collision dynamics, and attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. We analyzed the effects of chromosome number, size, movement velocity, and repulsive forces on the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing.

    **Main Findings:** Our model accurately recapitulates the efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed in wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast. We found that dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes contributes to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area, creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers rise above a certain threshold, reducing the available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play once distances between homologs are sufficiently small. A repulsive force that shortens the time spent in non-homologous interactions is a key feature of our pairing model, representing molecular processes that dissociate non-homologous chromosomes from each other.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that homolog pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct, yet temporally coinciding processes: homologs become confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation of interactions with the entire non-homologous chromosome set, achieved via a repulsive force. Confinement to smaller areas enables homologs to assess similarities, modeled as an attractive force.

    **Conclusions:** Our agent-based model provides new insights into the mechanisms of homolog pairing during meiosis, highlighting the importance of dissociation of non-homologous interactions and repulsive forces in facilitating homolog pairing. The model can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms, providing a valuable tool for understanding the complex processes of meiosis.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Tumor-Suppressive Function of miR-34a in Zebrafish: Implications for Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and Cancer Development

    **Research Question:** What is the role of miR-34a, a p53 target and modifier gene, in tumor suppression and cancer development in zebrafish, particularly in the context of Li-Fraumeni syndrome caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and transcriptomic approaches to investigate the function of miR-34a in zebrafish. We generated miR-34a mutant zebrafish and performed transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization (hpf) under control and DNA damage conditions. We also generated compound mutants with gain-of-function tp53R217H/R217H or tp53-/- mutations to assess the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that miR-34a is primarily dependent on p53 for induction under DNA damage conditions and partially dependent on p53 for its baseline expression. Loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells at 72 hpf. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation. Notably, compound miR-34a and tp53 mutants exhibited earlier tumor onset compared to single tp53 mutants, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that miR-34a plays a crucial role in tumor suppression and cancer development in zebrafish, particularly in the context of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The loss of miR-34a may contribute to cancer progression in humans carrying TP53 mutant alleles. Our study highlights the importance of miR-34a as a potential therapeutic target for cancer prevention and treatment.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the functional interactions between miR-34a and tp53 in zebrafish, and demonstrates the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a in cancer development. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Li-Fraumeni syndrome and cancer progression, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention and treatment.

    **Title:** XOL-1 Regulates Developmental Timing and Dosage Compensation in C. elegans Hermaphrodite Embryogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of XOL-1 in regulating developmental timing and dosage compensation in C. elegans hermaphrodite embryos?

    **Methods:** Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, we investigated the expression and function of XOL-1 in C. elegans hermaphrodite embryos. We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of xol-1 mutant embryos and compared them to wild-type embryos to identify changes in developmental timing and dosage compensation.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing and dosage compensation in C. elegans hermaphrodite embryos. We found that xol-1 mutant embryos exhibit an accelerated rate of cell division and a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program compared to wild-type embryos. Furthermore, we discovered that XOL-1 regulates the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. We also found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape, which is reversed by the loss of met-2.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that XOL-1 is a master regulator of developmental timing and dosage compensation in C. elegans hermaphrodite embryos. The loss of XOL-1 results in precocious establishment of dosage compensation and sex determination pathways, leading to accelerated embryonic development. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of sex determination and dosage compensation in multicellular organisms with heterogametic sexes.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study reveals a critical role for XOL-1 in regulating developmental timing and dosage compensation in C. elegans hermaphrodite embryos. These findings highlight the importance of XOL-1 as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes and provide new insights into the mechanisms of sex determination and dosage compensation in C. elegans.

**Title:** MGSurvE: A Computational Framework for Optimizing Trap Placement for Genetic Surveillance of Mosquito Populations

**Research Question:** Can a computational framework be developed to optimize trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations, minimizing the time to detection of an allele of interest?

**Methods:** We present MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE), a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations. MGSurvE accounts for important biological features of mosquitoes and their landscapes, including resource distribution, mosquito movement patterns, and trap attractiveness profiles. We used discrete optimization to minimize the mean expected time for a given mosquito to be trapped, considering all possible origins on the landscape.

**Main Findings:** We demonstrate the application of MGSurvE to two case studies: an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Our results show that MGSurvE can optimize trap placement to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest, with significant implications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.

**Implications:** The development of MGSurvE has important implications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations, particularly in the context of gene drive projects. By optimizing trap placement, MGSurvE can help detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes. This can inform remediation efforts and maximize the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs.

**Conclusions:** MGSurvE is a valuable resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. Our results demonstrate the potential of MGSurvE to optimize trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations, highlighting the importance of early detection in minimizing invasion impact and preserving the possibility of local elimination. Future applications of MGSurvE can inform the development of more effective genetic surveillance strategies for mosquito-borne diseases.

    **Title:** Symbiomonas scintillans harbors giant viruses, not endosymbiotic bacteria

    **Research Question:** What is the nature of the symbiotic relationship between Symbiomonas scintillans, a heterotrophic microbial eukaryote, and its previously reported endosymbiotic bacteria?

    **Methods:** We generated amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from two strains of S. scintillans (RCC257 and RCC24) to investigate the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria. We also conducted Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting various groups of bacteria to verify the absence of endobacteria.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to previous reports, we found no evidence of endosymbiotic bacteria in S. scintillans. Instead, our sequencing data revealed numerous contigs closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla (OlV, BpV, and MpV, respectively). We assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257, and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which we collectively call SsVs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar in morphology and size to the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that S. scintillans does not harbor an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is instead associated with giant viruses. This challenges the current understanding of the symbiotic relationship between S. scintillans and its previously reported endosymbiont.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that S. scintillans is a host to giant viruses, specifically prasinoviruses, rather than endosymbiotic bacteria. This discovery highlights the complexity and diversity of symbiotic relationships in microbial eukaryotes and underscores the need for further investigation into the interactions between hosts and their associated viruses. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution, ecology, and biology of S. scintillans and its associated viruses.

    **Title:** Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay Underlies Loss of Mutant LMOD2 Protein Expression in Dilated Cardiomyopathy

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the loss of LMOD2 protein expression in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations in the LMOD2 gene?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of LMOD2 protein in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations in the LMOD2 gene using western blot analysis and RT-qPCR. We also generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) to inhibit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of mutant LMOD2 transcripts.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is the primary mechanism underlying the loss of mutant LMOD2 protein expression in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations in the LMOD2 gene. We also demonstrate that SBOs can inhibit NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts, leading to increased expression of mutant-truncated protein.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the treatment of LMOD-linked myopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy. The use of SBOs to inhibit NMD in combination with drugs that promote translation of full-length protein could potentially rescue cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the loss of LMOD2 protein expression in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations in the LMOD2 gene. The development of SBOs that inhibit NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of LMOD-linked myopathies. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy of this approach in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by LMOD2 mutations.

    **Title:** Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) Isoforms Modulate Proteome Homeostasis in Transgenic Mice: Implications for Alzheimer’s Disease Risk

    **Research Question:** How do ApoE isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4) influence proteome homeostasis in the brain and liver of transgenic mice, and what are the implications for Alzheimer’s disease risk?

    **Methods:** We generated transgenic mice expressing human ApoE genes (isoform 2, 3, or 4) and measured changes in proteome homeostasis by combining protein abundance and turnover rates. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the regulation of ~2700 ontologies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ApoE4 and ApoE2 lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins in the brain, relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. ApoE4 mice exhibit dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy, reducing protein quality, while ApoE2 mice show coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In contrast, the liver did not exhibit these changes, suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain.

    **Implications:** Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology. We provide in vivo evidence that ApoE4-dependent changes in endosomal trafficking, autophagy, proteasome activity, and mitochondrial quality are linked to Alzheimer’s disease risk. Conversely, ApoE2 enhances brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover in tandem with a corresponding increase in proteolysis capacity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that ApoE isoforms modulate proteome homeostasis in a tissue-specific manner, with ApoE4 increasing and ApoE2 decreasing Alzheimer’s disease risk relative to ApoE3. Our findings support the hypothesis that ApoE4 expression reduces autophagy and proteasomal activity, diminishing capacity to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria. These results have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    Title: Tissue-Specific Gene Knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 in Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction: Development of a CRISPR-Mediated Tissue-Restricted Mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) Toolkit

    Research Question: Can we develop a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ)?

    Methods: We generated several Cas9 lines that are expressed in motoneurons, glial cells, or somatic muscles using Gal4-to-Cas9 conversion, enhancer-fusion, or CRISPR-mediated knock-in. We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes.

    Main Findings: We successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach, which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity. We found that SNARE components are essential for NMJ maintenance, and the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Furthermore, we discovered that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ.

    Implications: Our CRISPR-TRiM toolkit enables tissue-specific gene knockout in the Drosophila NMJ, a powerful model system for studying biological processes such as axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function and plasticity, and locomotion. This approach will facilitate the identification of genes important for NMJ structural plasticity and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NMJ biology.

    Conclusions: We have successfully developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in the Drosophila NMJ. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM in revealing genes important for NMJ structural plasticity and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NMJ biology. The CRISPR-TRiM toolkit will be a valuable resource for the Drosophila research community and will facilitate the study of NMJ biology and development.

    **Title:** Regulation of Post-Larval Hematopoiesis by the NF-κB Transcription Factor Relish in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the NF-κB transcription factor Relish in regulating post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila, and how does it interact with metabolic pathways to control progenitor differentiation?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of expression analyses, genetic manipulation, and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of Relish in regulating post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila. We examined the expression of Relish in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of larvae and its impact on the differentiation of ROS-primed progenitors.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Relish shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing the activation of JNK, a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Although ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1, which is regulated by Relish. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways is crucial for regulating cell fate transition during development. The negative regulation of NF-κB signaling over FAO has been reported in various disease conditions, suggesting that Relish may play a conserved role in regulating hematopoiesis across species.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that Relish is a key regulator of post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila, controlling the differentiation of ROS-primed progenitors by inhibiting the JNK-FAO cascade. The developmental circuit involving Relish, TAK1, and JNK ensures that the progenitor pool is not exhausted prematurely, highlighting the importance of integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways in regulating cell fate transition during development.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Pathophysiological Mechanisms of RTTN c.2953A>G Variant in Taybi-Linder Syndrome

    **Background:** Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. The disorder is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene, which is involved in the excision of minor introns. However, a patient presenting with TALS features was found to have a homozygous RTTN c.2953A>G variant instead.

    **Research Question:** What are the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the RTTN c.2953A>G variant identified in a patient with a Taybi-Linder-like syndrome?

    **Methods:** We used patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) or cortical organoids (COs). We analyzed the impact of the RTTN isoforms resulting from the mutated allele and conducted cellular studies of the centrosome/primary cilium complex and their related functions.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the RTTN c.2953A>G variant leads to major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities in NSCs, resulting in aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Additionally, we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSCs into neural rosettes, with delayed apico-basal polarization of NSCs. These defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids, impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease associated with Taybi-Linder syndrome. The RTTN c.2953A>G variant, which alters the splicing donor site sequence of intron 23, disrupts the normal function of RTTN in the centrosome/primary cilium complex, leading to cellular abnormalities and aneuploidy.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings establish RTTN c.2953A>G as a pathogenic variant that contributes to the development of Taybi-Linder syndrome. The study highlights the importance of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSCs into neural rosettes and provides new avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying microcephaly.

    **Title:** Convergent Adaptation and Historical Contingency in Escherichia coli under Long-Term Stationary Phase

    **Background:** Escherichia coli, a non-sporulating bacterial species, can survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase (LTSP). To investigate the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP, we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments in 2015.

    **Research Question:** What are the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP, and how do genetic mutations contribute to this process?

    **Methods:** We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points over six years from five independently evolving populations of E. coli K12 MG1655.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically under LTSP through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations. We observed the establishment of long-lasting lineages, which are themselves convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. Furthermore, we found that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one association suggestive of historical contingency.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. This suggests that the process of adaptation under LTSP is influenced by the accumulation of mutations at specific loci, which can lead to the emergence of similar lineages across populations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP, highlighting the importance of convergent mutation accumulation and historical contingency in this process. These findings have implications for our understanding of bacterial evolution and adaptation in resource-limited environments. The high parallelism observed in our study also enables the identification of pairs of putatively contingent loci, which can inform our understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation under LTSP.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into the Repression of Protein Translation in the iab-8 lncRNA Transcript

    **Background:** The male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a crucial role in determining sperm usage in mated females. Interestingly, the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter, called the iab-8 lncRNA. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, the iab-8 transcript does not.

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism underlying the repression of protein translation in the iab-8 lncRNA transcript?

    **Methods:** We employed cell culture and transgenic analysis to investigate the regulation of protein translation in the iab-8 transcript. We generated GFP reporter constructs in tissue culture cells and transgenic constructs in living flies to examine the effect of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' exons of iab-8 on downstream translation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the presence of uORFs in the 5' exons of iab-8 prevents downstream translation from the iab-8 transcript. Specifically, we found that the two unique 5' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA contain uORFs that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the repression of protein translation in the iab-8 lncRNA transcript. The presence of uORFs in the 5' exons of iab-8 acts as a repressive mechanism, preventing the translation of the iab-8 transcript into a protein. This mechanism is crucial for the regulation of gene expression in the posterior central nervous system, where the iab-8 transcript is normally expressed.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the repression of protein translation in the iab-8 lncRNA transcript is mediated by uORFs in the 5' exons of iab-8. These findings have important implications for our understanding of gene regulation in Drosophila and may have broader implications for the study of gene regulation in other organisms.
Title: Leveraging Evolutionary Rate Covariation to Identify Common Genetic Modifiers of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation

    Abstract:
    Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of ultra-rare, multisystemic disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays. Despite their clinical variability, CDG share similar physiological and clinical symptoms, suggesting the presence of common genetic modifiers. We employed evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis to identify shared biological functions and pathways between CDG and glycosylation genes. Our results reveal strong ERC signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways, including N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with non-coding RNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. Furthermore, we identified patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. Our study demonstrates the utility of ERC analysis in prioritizing potential genetic modifiers of CDG, providing a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. This approach can be applied to other complex diseases, enabling the rapid identification of common genetic modifiers and facilitating the development of targeted therapies.

    Research Question:
    Can evolutionary rate covariation analysis be used to identify common genetic modifiers of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG)?

    Methods:
    We employed evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis to identify shared biological functions and pathways between CDG and glycosylation genes. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with non-coding RNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins.

    Main Findings:
    We identified strong ERC signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways, including N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes.

    Implications:
    Our study demonstrates the utility of ERC analysis in prioritizing potential genetic modifiers of CDG, providing a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. This approach can be applied to other complex diseases, enabling the rapid identification of common genetic modifiers and facilitating the development of targeted therapies.

    Conclusions:
    Our results suggest that ERC analysis can be a powerful tool for identifying common genetic modifiers of CDG, and potentially other complex diseases. By leveraging the evolutionary conservation of glycosylation pathways, we can rapidly prioritize potential genetic modifiers and develop targeted therapies for CDG and other related disorders.

    **Title:** Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation Cascade of HBV Core Protein Regulates Pregenomic RNA Encapsidation

    **Research Question:** How does the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade of the HBV core protein (HBc) regulate the encapsidation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) into nucleocapsids?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and structural biology approaches, including immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and protein structural analyses, to investigate the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade of HBc and its role in pgRNA encapsidation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the HBc C-terminal domain (CTD) undergoes phosphorylation at Ser162 and Ser170, which is essential for nucleation with the polymerase (Pol) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. However, as capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation. Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170, we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. We also demonstrated that the Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is mediated by the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1, which is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that HBV Pol plays a dual role in pgRNA encapsidation by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids. The Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and is associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs).

    **Conclusions:** Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation and reveals the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HBV replication and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HBV infection.

    **Title:** Convergent Evolution of Nitrogen Fixation in Chemosynthetic Symbionts Facilitated by Horizontal Gene Transfer

    **Research Question:** How have environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus of Panama influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities in chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena?

    **Methods:** We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena, collected on either side of the Isthmus of Panama. We used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to recover metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of bacterial symbionts associated with Codakia and Ctena sister species from both sides of the Isthmus.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts, and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) did not. Interestingly, this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon revealed that the last common ancestor (LCA) of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage.

    **Implications:** Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. This highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change. Our findings demonstrate the importance of HGT in shaping the evolution of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities in response to changing environmental conditions. This research has significant implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between hosts and their symbionts in marine ecosystems.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Evolution and Functional Implications of TAS2Rs in Vertebrates: A Phylogenomic Analysis

    **Research Question:** What is the evolutionary history and functional significance of TAS2Rs, a family of G protein-coupled receptors involved in bitter taste perception, across vertebrate lineages?

    **Methods:** We conducted a large-scale phylogenomic analysis of 661 vertebrate genomes to identify and characterize TAS2R genes. Our workflow involved gene mining, phylogenetic reconstruction, and in vitro receptor activity assays to explore the functional implications of TAS2Rs in vertebrates.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that frogs and salamanders possess an unusually high number of TAS2R genes, with 9,291 TAS2Rs identified across 661 vertebrate genomes. In contrast to other vertebrates, amphibians have additional TAS2R gene clusters and more genes per cluster. We found that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, suggesting that TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Notably, TAS2R count is proportional to the number of receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays demonstrate that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the evolution of TAS2Rs in vertebrates is driven by multiple mechanisms, including recombination and gene conversion. The expansion of TAS2Rs in frogs and salamanders may have allowed for the acquisition of tissue-specific functions, such as chemosensing in extra-oral tissues. This study highlights the importance of exploring the functional implications of TAS2Rs in non-mammalian vertebrates, which may provide insights into the evolution of taste perception and chemosensing in vertebrates.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and functional significance of TAS2Rs across vertebrate lineages. The discovery of TAS2Rs in extra-oral tissues of amphibians suggests that these receptors play a crucial role in detecting ecologically important xenobiotics, underscoring the importance of exploring the functional implications of TAS2Rs in non-mammalian vertebrates. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of taste perception and chemosensing in vertebrates.

    **Title:** Notch Dimerization-Deficient Mice Reveal a Novel Role for HDAC2 in Intestinal Stem Cell Maintenance and Innate Immunity

    **Research Question:** How does Notch dimerization regulate intestinal stem cell maintenance and innate immunity in mammals?

    **Methods:** We employed a Notch dimerization-deficient (NDD) mouse model to investigate the role of Notch dimerization in intestinal and colonic stem cells. We used transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids, TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry, and the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid (VPA) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Notch loss-of-function phenotypes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that NDD mice are sensitized to environmental insults but develop and age normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene misregulation. However, we discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, suggesting a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. Furthermore, TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses revealed an unbalanced interactome in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing NOTCH2DD, with reduced interaction with the transcription machinery but preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Notch dimerization in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation of an enhancer subset and more about the overall proteome environment with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions. We also discovered that HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, as inhibition of HDAC2 with VPA prevented the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors (DBZ or DAPT) treatment in mice and spheroids.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel role for HDAC2 in intestinal stem cell maintenance and innate immunity, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and the pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Notch loss-of-function phenotypes and highlight the importance of HDAC2 activity in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

    **Title:** Quantifying the Effects of Background Selection in Structured Populations with Migration

    **Research Question:** How does background selection, a process by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, influence patterns of total neutral diversity (πT) and genetic differentiation (FST) in structured populations with migration?

    **Methods:** We derived novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extended previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. We used simulations to show that this theory best predicts FST and πT.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, as migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. We also found that background selection may weakly confound locus-to-locus FST scans when gene flow is sufficiently common.

    **Implications:** Our work extends the theory of background selection into structured populations and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans. These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of background selection on genetic diversity and differentiation in natural populations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a novel theoretical derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model, accounting for the effects of migration. We show that migration can attenuate the effects of background selection on FST, particularly when migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles. Our results highlight the importance of considering migration in the context of background selection and provide a framework for understanding the complex interactions between selection, migration, and genetic diversity in structured populations.

    **Title:** Federated Genetic Association Testing with Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models: A Privacy-Preserving Approach for High-Powered Studies

    **Research Question:** Can a federated genetic association testing tool, FedGMMAT, be developed to correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites while protecting sensitive data under a privacy-preserving framework?

    **Methods:** We developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and intermediate statistics are protected by encryption using homomorphic encryption (HE) and a symmetric One-Time Pad (OTP)-like encryption mechanism.

    **Main Findings:** Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that FedGMMAT can achieve virtually the same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. FedGMMAT is flexible to integrate multiple subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations.

    **Implications:** The increasing size of genetic and phenotypic data is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. However, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. Federated approaches, such as FedGMMAT, are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance. Our results show that FedGMMAT can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites while protecting sensitive data under a privacy-preserving framework.

    **Conclusions:** FedGMMAT is a novel federated genetic association testing tool that addresses the challenges of high-powered studies by correcting for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects while protecting sensitive data. Our results demonstrate that FedGMMAT can achieve virtually the same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. This approach has the potential to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among institutions, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the genetic determinants of diseases.

    **Title:** Evaluating the Performance of Polygenic Risk Scores in Predicting Prostate Cancer Across Ancestral Populations

    **Background:** Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with significant ancestry-biased incidence and mortality rates. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have emerged as a promising tool for predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, the accuracy of PRSs in diverse populations, particularly African and Asian populations, remains a concern for equitable use.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to evaluate the performance of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, in predicting prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts.

    **Methods:** We benchmarked the predictive power of six PRS derivation algorithms, including variant prioritization, continuous shrinkage, joint analysis of summary statistics, functional annotation, fine mapping, and population-specific heritability estimates, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared to a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. Notably, hierarchical clustering was found to be adequate for stratifying polygenic scores by ancestry. We also demonstrated the utility of scores generated from the UK Biobank dataset, showing that genetic risk coupled with participant age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer.

    **Implications:** Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts. PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone. However, given ancestry-associated PCa incidence and outcome biases, it is crucial that risk scores work equally well across populations to limit disparities.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of pan-ancestry polygenic risk for prostate cancer in the All of Us cohort. Our results highlight the need for continued research aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of PRSs in diverse populations, ultimately contributing to more equitable healthcare outcomes for prostate cancer patients.

    Title: Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets for DPAGT1-CDG through Drug Repurposing in a Drosophila Model

    Background: DPAGT1-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DPAGT1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. Currently, there are no effective therapies for this disorder.

    Research Question: Can a drug repurposing screen in a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG identify new potential therapeutics and biological interactions with DPAGT1?

    Methods: We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype. We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1,520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model.

    Main Findings: Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. We also genetically validated other top drug categories, including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1.

    Implications: These findings link dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represent a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG. The identified drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms, and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the utility of a drug repurposing screen in a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG to identify new potential therapeutics and biological interactions with DPAGT1. We have identified multiple drugs that improve a Drosophila model of DPAGT1 deficiency and have established new biological connections between DPAGT1 and DA signaling, NKCC1, and prostaglandin synthesis. These findings provide new avenues for the development of effective therapies for DPAGT1-CDG.
Title: Elucidating Proprioceptive Representations in the Somatosensory Cortex: A Novel Topographic Variational Autoencoder Approach

Abstract:

Background: Proprioception, the sense of body position and movement, is a fundamental aspect of motor control, yet its neural representation in the somatosensory cortex remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex using a novel computational model, the topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE).

Methods: We developed a topo-VAE model that computes a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data, without prior knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. We trained, validated, and tested the model on natural daily human arm movement kinematics and explored the emergent proprioceptive representations in its cortical layer.

Main Findings: Our model reproduced two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: (1) the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and (2) the distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model also made several testable predictions, including the encoding across the cortex having a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs and few neurons encoding just a single joint.

Implications: Our model provides a principled basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with potential applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of the topo-VAE model in elucidating proprioceptive representations in the somatosensory cortex, shedding light on the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex. The model's ability to generalize to other regions of sensory cortex and its testable predictions make it a valuable tool for further investigating the neural basis of proprioception.

    **Title:** Ethylene Signaling in Azospirillum brasilense: A Novel Mechanism of Plant-Microbe Interaction

    **Research Question:** What is the role of ethylene signaling in Azospirillum brasilense, a plant-associated bacterium, and how does it affect plant-microbe interactions?

    **Methods:** We investigated the presence and function of an ethylene receptor, Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 (AzoEtr1), in Azospirillum brasilense. We used biochemical assays to demonstrate that AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity. We also employed RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to examine the metabolic changes induced by ethylene in A. brasilense.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that AzoEtr1 is a functional ethylene receptor that affects biofilm formation, root colonization, and carbon and nitrogen metabolism in A. brasilense. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed widespread metabolic changes, including the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate, in response to ethylene.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, indicating that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. This study provides new insights into the role of ethylene signaling in plant-microbe interactions and identifies potential targets for regulating beneficial plant-microbe associations.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that AzoEtr1 is a functional ethylene receptor in A. brasilense, the first described in a proteobacterium. We propose a model in which ethylene from host plants affects the pattern and density of colonization by A. brasilense, suggesting a novel mechanism of plant-microbe interaction. These results have implications for understanding the complex interactions between plants and their associated microorganisms and may lead to the development of new strategies for regulating beneficial plant-microbe associations.

    **Title:** INO80 Regulates Chromatin Accessibility and DNA Repair on Meiotic Sex Chromosomes in Male Mice

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the INO80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of INO80, the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice using immunolocalization, gene expression analysis, and chromatin accessibility assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that INO80 localizes to the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes and is essential for silencing sex-linked genes. Deletion of INO80 leads to high expression of sex-linked genes and incomplete inactivation of these genes. We also found that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors, such as ATR and MDC1, to the sex chromosomes during pachynema. Furthermore, INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DNA double-strand break (DSB) regions on the sex chromosomes, which is independent of the histone variant H2A.Z.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that INO80 plays a crucial role in regulating chromatin accessibility and DNA repair on meiotic sex chromosomes, thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema. This role is independent of H2A.Z, a common INO80 target, and involves the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sex chromosomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a unique function of INO80 in regulating chromatin accessibility and DNA repair on meiotic sex chromosomes, which is essential for the silencing of sex-linked genes in male mice. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic sex chromosome silencing and highlight the importance of INO80 in maintaining genome stability during meiosis.

    **Title:** Cytidine Deaminase SVH-17/CDD-2 Regulates Axon Regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans by Converting SVH-1 from a Protease to a Growth Factor

    **Research Question:** What is the role of cytidine deaminase (CDD) SVH-17/CDD-2 in the functional conversion of SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family, from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and molecular biology techniques to investigate the relationship between CDD-2 and SVH-1 in the regulation of axon regeneration in C. elegans. We performed RNA interference (RNAi) screens to identify genes involved in the JNK signaling pathway that regulates axon regeneration, including the svh-17/cdd-2 gene encoding CDD-2.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CDD-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor. We found that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Additionally, we discovered that the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is necessary for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by modifying the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through the modification of svh-1 mRNA. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration in C. elegans and highlights the importance of CDD-2 in regulating the functional conversion of SVH-1.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that CDD-2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of axon regeneration in C. elegans by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration and has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to promote axon regeneration in neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Tuning Collective Behaviour in Zebrafish through Genetic Modification: A Novel Approach to Active Matter Systems

    **Research Question:** Can genetic modification be used to control the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally?

    **Methods:** We genetically modified zebrafish by knocking out the col11a2 gene, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. We then monitored the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2-/- zebrafish in a laboratory setting, tracking individual fish and their interactions.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the col11a2-/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, reduced body-bending in swimming, and longer orientational relaxation times compared to wildtype zebrafish. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We captured the collective behaviour of both wildtype and col11a2-/- zebrafish using a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish were modelled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing the characteristics of the constituents in a bottom-up manner, similar to colloids and de novo proteins. This approach allows for the control of collective behaviour at the level of the individual constituents, rather than externally. Our results have implications for understanding the relationship between genetic traits and physiological changes in biological systems.

    **Conclusions:** We have shown that genetic modification can be used to control the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems. By modelling the swimming behaviour of zebrafish as active matter, we can reveal physiologically relevant behaviours that are underpinned by changes to the skeleton. This approach has the potential to be used as a tool to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviours to genetic traits and physiological changes within the body. Our study provides a novel perspective on the control of collective behaviour in biological systems and highlights the utility of active matter models in understanding complex biological phenomena.

    **Title:** Simulating Capillary Plexus Cultivation: A Hybrid Model of Mechanical Regulation and Chemical Stimulation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of mechanical and chemical stimuli in the development of capillary-like networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine?

    **Methods:** We developed a hybrid model combining the Cellular Potts model (CPM) and continuum-based partial differential equations (PDEs) to simulate short-term in vitro capillary incubations. The model predicted individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transport dynamics.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that capillary-like networks developed in high integrity only when mechanical and chemical couplings worked simultaneously. The model revealed that the soluble and bound forms of VEGF play distinct roles in endothelial cell morphology and haptotaxis, respectively. Specifically, soluble VEGF induced morphological changes, while bound VEGF on the biogel surface provided orientational signals. Adequate biogel deformation, sufficient bound VEGF, and a bound VEGF gradient were necessary for capillary-like network development.

    **Implications:** Our hybrid model provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli in capillary network formation. The results have significant implications for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, where capillary plexus cultivation is crucial for vascularization and tissue repair.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of simultaneous mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in capillary network development. The model highlights the distinct roles of soluble and bound VEGF in endothelial cell behavior and provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between cells, biogel, and VEGF in tissue engineering applications. While our results show good agreement with experiments, further research is needed to address limitations, such as the omission of bound VEGF in mechanical mechanisms and the incomplete reproduction of tilted biogel experiments by chemical mechanisms.

    **Title:** Diversification of TGF-β Ligand Functions in Caenorhabditis elegans Immune Response to Bacterial Pathogens

    **Research Question:** How do the five TGF-β ligands in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) contribute to the innate immune response against bacterial pathogens?

    **Methods:** We investigated the roles of the five TGF-β ligands (DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3) in the C. elegans immune response to bacterial pathogens using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that all five TGF-β ligands play a significant role in the survival of C. elegans against bacterial pathogens. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act non-redundantly as part of this response. Notably, the two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2 and TIG-3, a TGF-β/Activin-like ligand, function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Furthermore, we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the complex roles of TGF-β ligands in the C. elegans immune response to bacterial pathogens. The non-redundant relationships between TGF-β ligands from different classes highlight the importance of ligand interactions in modulating the immune response. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of TGF-β signaling pathways and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections.

    **Title:** N-terminal Acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4) Regulates DNA Damage Response and Checkpoint Signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** What is the role of N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) and checkpoint signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of Nat4 in DDR. We generated yeast cells lacking Nat4 (nat4Δ) and analyzed their sensitivity to DNA damage, chromatin structure, and checkpoint signaling dynamics.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that yeast cells lacking Nat4 exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, Nat4 expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited to double-strand breaks. We found that Nat4 regulates the DNA damage signaling cascade by acetylating histone H4, which is essential for the deposition of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph (γH2A) and the retention of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effects of Nat4 on checkpoint signaling are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity. The findings of this study expand the repertoire of histone modifiers implicated in DDR and shed light on a novel function for Nat4 N-terminal acetyltransferase in regulating the response to DNA damage and checkpoint dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study identifies Nat4 as a novel player in DDR, serving as a paradigm for the NAT family of enzymes. We demonstrate that Nat4 regulates the DNA damage signaling cascade by acetylating histone H4, which is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR and checkpoint signaling, and highlight the importance of histone modifications in regulating genome stability.

    **Title:** Orchard: A Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Reconstructing Large-Scale Cancer Phylogenies

    **Background:** Cancer phylogenies, which depict the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, offer valuable insights into cancer development and guide treatment strategies. However, existing methods for reconstructing cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing become inaccurate when dealing with more than 30 mutations, or fail to recover a phylogeny altogether.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel algorithm that accurately reconstructs large-scale cancer phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations?

    **Methods:** We introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations.

    **Main Findings:** Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.

    **Implications:** The ability to accurately reconstruct large-scale cancer phylogenies using Orchard has significant implications for our understanding of cancer development and progression. These phylogenies can reveal important evolutionary events, characterize cancer heterogeneity and progression, support the discovery of new driver mutations, and provide clinical insight for treatment regimens.

    **Conclusions:** Orchard is a fast and accurate algorithm for reconstructing large-scale cancer phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations. Our results demonstrate that Orchard can reliably match or beat ground-truth baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer. We anticipate that improvements to the current algorithm and the development of new algorithms that utilize large mutations trees reconstructed by Orchard will result in even greater performance.

    **Title:** ImmugenX: A Modular Protein Language Model for Predicting CD8+ Neoantigen Immunogenicity

    **Research Question:** Can a modular protein language modeling approach improve the prediction of CD8+ neoantigen immunogenicity, a crucial step in the development of personalized cancer therapeutics?

    **Methods:** We developed ImmugenX, a modular protein language model that integrates a pMHC encoding module, an optional TCR encoding module, and a set of context-specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. ImmugenX was trained on three pMHC prediction tasks and evaluated on publicly available CD8+ reactivity data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ImmugenX outperforms state-of-the-art models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.619 and an average precision of 0.514. The integration of TCR context information further improves ImmugenX's performance, highlighting the importance of considering TCR specificity in immunogenicity prediction. Notably, ImmugenX shows a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model.

    **Implications:** ImmugenX's improved performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction has significant implications for the development of personalized cancer therapeutics. By accurately identifying CD8+ neoepitopes, ImmugenX can facilitate the design of targeted and effective treatments. Additionally, our analysis of ImmugenX's performance highlights areas of weakness in existing immunogenicity models and biases in public datasets, providing valuable insights for future research.

    **Conclusions:** ImmugenX represents a significant advancement in the field of immunogenicity prediction, offering a modular language modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction and can integrate new inputs such as TCRs. Our results demonstrate the potential of ImmugenX to improve the development of personalized cancer therapies and highlight the importance of considering TCR specificity in immunogenicity prediction. Further research is needed to understand the population of low EL rank but positive reactivity epitopes in datasets, and ImmugenX provides a strong framework for addressing this challenge.
Title: Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Protein Phosphatase 1 Catalytic Subunit Gamma (PPP1CC) as a Key Regulator of Meat Color in Chickens

Abstract:
Meat quality is a critical factor influencing consumer preference, and color is a primary indicator of meat quality. In this study, we employed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to identify genes associated with meat lightness and redness. Our results pinpointed a 6.24 kb QTL region (GGA15: 6298.34–6304.58 kb) containing the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP1CC) gene, which was significantly associated with meat color (P = 8.65E-08). Mendelian randomization analyses further validated the causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness (P < 2.9E-12). We generated inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout (PPP1CC-SSKO) mice, which exhibited increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in limb muscles, along with a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and targeted metabolome analyses revealed that PPP1CC inhibition decreased the expression of slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes, while enhancing the glycolysis pathway. A SNP (rs315520807, C > T) located in the intron of PPP1CC was found to regulate gene transcription activity. Furthermore, we detected differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, frequency of rs315520807 variant, expression of PPP1CC, and fast-twitch fiber marker genes between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. Our study identifies PPP1CC as the causative gene for meat color and provides a novel target gene and variant for meat improvement technology innovation.

    **Title:** Super-Resolved Tomographic Reconstruction (STR): A Novel Technique for Identifying Receptive Field Subunits in Retinal Ganglion Cells

    **Research Question:** Can a novel technique, combining concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography, efficiently identify and locate receptive field subunits in retinal ganglion cells?

    **Methods:** We introduce Super-Resolved Tomographic Reconstruction (STR), a technique that leverages the principles of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and computed tomography (CT) scans to stimulate and locate receptive field subunits in retinal ganglion cells. We tested the feasibility of STR using simulations and electrophysiological recordings from primate parasol ganglion cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that STR can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations and can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time. This makes STR an ideal technique for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings.

    **Implications:** The ability to efficiently identify and locate receptive field subunits using STR has significant implications for understanding the functional architecture of the retina. By knowing the subunit locations, targeted stimuli can be manufactured to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties, nonlinearities, and functional synaptic weight of each subunit, and evaluate their similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field.

    **Conclusions:** Our study introduces a novel technique, STR, that has the potential to revolutionize the field of retinal research. By combining the strengths of super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography, STR offers a powerful tool for investigating the functional architecture of the retina. The ability to efficiently identify and locate receptive field subunits will enable researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the retinal circuitry and its role in visual processing. Furthermore, STR has the potential to be used in online analysis and closed-loop investigations, making it an ideal technique for real-time studies of the retina.

    **Title:** CRISPRi-DR: A Novel Statistical Method for Identifying Chemical-Genetic Interactions using CRISPR Interference Technology

    **Research Question:** How can CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology be used to identify chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs) between genes and antibiotics, and what statistical methods can be employed to analyze these interactions?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel statistical method, CRISPRi-DR (Dose-Response model), to analyze CRISPRi data from CGI experiments. This method incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation to capture the non-linear interaction between them. We applied CRISPRi-DR to a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. Instead, sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength. We demonstrate that CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision compared to other analytical methods, especially in noisier datasets.

    **Implications:** The CRISPRi-DR method can be used to identify genes that interact with antibiotics, providing insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets and can be used to identify genes whose level of depletion synergizes with increasing drug concentration.

    **Conclusions:** CRISPRi-DR is a powerful tool for analyzing CRISPRi data from CGI experiments. By incorporating both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation, CRISPRi-DR captures the non-linear interaction between them, allowing for the identification of genes that interact with antibiotics. Our results demonstrate the potential of CRISPRi-DR to improve the analysis of CRISPRi data and provide new insights into chemical-genetic interactions.

    Title: Revisiting the Assumption of Modularity in Gene Co-expression Networks: A Novel Approach Using the Weighted Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model

    Research Question: Can we find meaningful communities in gene co-expression networks without imposing a modular organization, and how modular are these communities?

    Methods: We employed the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), a community detection method that does not assume assortative modules, to analyze RNAseq gene expression data from two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the SBM is able to identify ten times as many groups as competing methods, including several non-modular gene groups. Notably, the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities, suggesting that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought.

    Implications: These findings challenge the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks. Our results highlight the need to incorporate other sources of information, beyond assortativity, when exploring biological networks.

    Conclusions: We demonstrate that non-modular blocks are widespread in gene co-expression networks and that their functional relevance is as strong as for modular blocks. This study underscores the importance of using methods that do not rely on modularity maximization to determine whether there are general patterns of non-modular organization. Future studies should combine community detection with network inference methods, such as the graphical lasso, to provide more accurate estimates of gene-gene connections and weights. The weighted nested Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model (wnDC-SBM) offers a promising approach for finding meaningful gene groups that are not necessarily assortative but still have clear biological interpretation. Our results have significant implications for the field of systems biology and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of gene co-expression networks.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Multifaceted Role of Cytoplasmic Poly(A)-Binding Protein in Post-Transcriptional Regulation

    **Research Question:** What are the direct and indirect roles of Cytoplasmic Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABPC) in post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay?

    **Methods:** We employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the yeast proteome and RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome in cells lacking the PAB1 gene.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that pab1Δ cells exhibit drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. The defects in translation initiation and stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex, in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes. Furthermore, cells devoid of Pab1 manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that the elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins. This suggests that PABPC plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of post-transcriptional processes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the multifaceted role of PABPC in post-transcriptional regulation, including its direct and indirect effects on translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. The results highlight the complexity of PABPC’s regulatory functions and underscore the importance of considering the stoichiometry between PABPC, poly(A) tracts, and basal translation levels when interpreting genome-wide gene expression alterations in PABPC-depleted cells.

    **Title:** Exploring the Role of Na+/K+-ATPase in Generating Slow Oscillations in Neurons

    **Research Question:** Can the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration dynamics, mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase, generate slow oscillations in neurons?

    **Methods:** We employed bifurcation analysis and the slow-fast method to investigate a minimalistic model of a class I excitable neuron, focusing on the role of the Na+/K+-ATPase in generating slow oscillations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the coupling between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration dynamics, mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase, suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing of the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and inform therapeutic strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the ubiquitous nature of the mechanism by which extracellular potassium dynamics and Na+/K+-ATPase can induce slow rhythms in single neurons and beyond. The interplay between potassium dynamics and neuronal excitability in class I neuron models with SNIC dynamics can give rise to slow bursting under minimal conditions, providing a new perspective on the generation of slow oscillations in neurons. This research has significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying various neurological disorders and may inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

    **Title:** Evaluating Multi-View Clustering Methods for Cancer Subtyping: A Robust Framework for Data-Driven and Pathway-Driven Approaches

    **Research Question:** How do data-driven and pathway-driven multi-view clustering methods compare in identifying cancer subtypes, and what are the implications for patient stratification and personalized treatment?

    **Methods:** We developed the COPS R-package, a comprehensive framework for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS incorporates advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. We applied COPS to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. We also demonstrated the importance of incorporating pathway information into multi-view clustering methods, which resulted in more interpretable clustering outcomes with enhanced prognostic relevance.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the need for a multi-objective evaluation of multi-view clustering methods, including cluster stability, prognostic relevance, and comparison of metrics. We applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Our findings provide insights into the potential of multi-omics clustering analysis for cancer subtyping and may have implications for improving patient stratification and personalized treatment.

    **Conclusions:** The COPS R-package offers a robust framework for evaluating multi-view clustering methods, allowing for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven approaches. Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating pathway information into multi-view clustering methods, which can result in more interpretable clustering outcomes with enhanced prognostic relevance. Our results have significant implications for cancer research and may contribute to the development of more effective personalized treatment strategies.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Multifaceted Role of SEM-2 in C. elegans Postembryonic Development

    **Research Question:** What are the novel functions of SEM-2, the sole SoxC protein in C. elegans, in regulating postembryonic development, particularly in the M lineage?

    **Methods:** We identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the DNA-binding domain. We analyzed mutant animals harboring this point mutation to uncover new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the sex myoblast (SM) lineage. Furthermore, we found that SEM-2 directly regulates the expression of hlh-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor critical for proper patterning of the M lineage.

    **Implications:** Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. We also identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development, which are likely conserved in other species. These findings add to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the multifaceted role of SEM-2 in C. elegans postembryonic development, particularly in the M lineage. We demonstrate that SEM-2 regulates dorsoventral patterning, proliferation, and diversification of the SM lineage, and directly regulates the expression of hlh-8. These findings provide new insights into the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and shed light on the evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Our study contributes to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins and highlights the importance of SEM-2 in regulating postembryonic development in C. elegans.
