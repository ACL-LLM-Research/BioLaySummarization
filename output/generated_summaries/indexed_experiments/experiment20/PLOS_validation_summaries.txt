    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of RNA 3′-End Processing in Gene Expression Variation across Human Individuals

    **Research Question:** How do DNA sequence variants impact gene expression, particularly in the context of RNA 3′-end processing, and what are the implications for understanding phenotypic variation in humans?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals using 3′-end RNA-seq to map the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends. We analyzed the genomic relationship between biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and gene expression differences across our set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from distinct human genotypes.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. We found that the usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes, and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms.

    **Implications:** Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. These findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the role of RNA 3′-end processing in gene expression variation across human individuals, highlighting the importance of 3′ regulatory motifs as predictors of expression variation. We speculate that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3′-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population, and that polymorphisms in 3′ motifs that govern transcript fate can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of the genes in which they lie.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Protection Induced by the Live Attenuated Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (LASIV) Vaccine SIVΔnef

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying the remarkable protective efficacy of the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (LASIV) vaccine SIVΔnef against wild-type lentiviral challenge?

    **Methods:** We employed deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response, identify regions of immune pressure and viral escape, and delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. Notably, we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. These findings correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design. The SIVΔnef vaccine, long considered the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research, serves as a proof-of-concept vaccine that underscores the importance of these principles in inducing protective immunity against lentiviral challenge.

    **Conclusions:** Our research provides new insights into the mechanisms of protection induced by the SIVΔnef vaccine, shedding light on the complex interplay between the host immune response and viral evolution. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of effective HIV/SIV vaccines, emphasizing the need to incorporate anentropic specificity and repertoire depth into vaccine design strategies.
Title: Interleukin-1 Receptor Signaling Regulates Neutrophil Response and Antifungal Immunity in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis

    Abstract:
    Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), a mucosal infection caused by Candida albicans, is a frequent form of fungal disease in humans. While cellular immunity plays a crucial role in host protection, the induction of antifungal immunity remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of OPC, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling in the neutrophil response against C. albicans. Our results show that IL-1R signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels: the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. We demonstrate that IL-1R-deficient mice display impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the circulation in response to C. albicans. Notably, endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC, responding to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. Our findings establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection, highlighting the importance of IL-1R signaling in coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa to prevent fungal growth and dissemination. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of antifungal immunity and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against OPC.
Title: Quantifying the Economic Benefits of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF)

Abstract:

Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating and widespread tropical disease that affects 1.3 billion individuals in 83 endemic countries. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000 to guide endemic countries in implementing mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs to eliminate the disease.

Research Question: What are the economic benefits of the GPELF in terms of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost-labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals?

Methods: A comprehensive review of multiple data sources, including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization, International Monetary Fund, and International Labour Organization, was conducted to estimate the economic benefits of the GPELF. The number of clinical manifestations averted was quantified, and the savings associated with disease prevention were analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost-labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals.

Main Findings: The GPELF delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual MDA of anti-filarial drugs between 2000-2007. An estimated US$21.8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, over US$2.3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Additionally, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19.5 billion. Furthermore, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity save the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2.2 billion.

Implications: The results of this study demonstrate that MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits. With favorable program implementation costs, largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry, it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health.

Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive economic analysis of the GPELF, highlighting the significant economic benefits of the Programme in terms of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost-labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals. The results of this study will inform policymakers, public health administrators, and program funders about the value of investing in the GPELF and will help to justify the resources invested in the Programme.

    **Title:** Investigating the Pathological Mechanisms of Glucocerebrosidase Deficiency in Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease

    **Research Question:** How do homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic Gaucher disease (GD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)?

    **Methods:** We generated GBA nonsense mutant (GBA-/-) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, allowing us to investigate the pathological progression of neuronopathic GD.

    **Main Findings:** GBA-/- medaka displayed pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD, including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed pathological findings revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model, providing insights into the pathological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency. Our findings suggest that α-syn may not be a primary contributor to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD, challenging the current understanding of the relationship between GBA mutations and α-syn accumulation in PD.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new evidence for the role of GCase deficiency in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD and sheds light on the complex relationship between GBA mutations and α-syn accumulation in PD. Our findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapies for neuronopathic GD and PD, and highlight the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of these diseases.

    **Title:** Phagosome-Confined Listeria monocytogenes Suppresses Adaptive Immunity through IL-10-Dependent Mechanism

    **Background:** Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a facultative intracellular pathogen that induces a robust cell-mediated immune response upon sub-lethal infection. The bacterium's ability to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is crucial for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity.

    **Research Question:** How does the presence of L. monocytogenes confined within a phagosome impact the adaptive immune response to the bacterium within the host cell cytosol?

    **Methods:** Mice were infected with two distinct strains of L. monocytogenes: ActA-Lm, which escapes into the host cell cytosol and elicits long-lived CD8 T cell-dependent protective immunity, and LLO-Lm, which is confined within a phagosome.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that the impaired T cell response to L. monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation, but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response. The presence of phagosome-confined L. monocytogenes suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10. Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restored protective immunity.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells. The results suggest that IL-10 acts as a negative regulator of T cell potency in CD8 T cells, while acting as a positive regulator of cellular immunity via its effects on other cell types.

    **Conclusions:** The presence of L. monocytogenes within a phagosome negatively impacts both the primary CD4 and CD8 T cell response to cytosolic ActA-Lm, as well as protective immunity. Our study highlights the critical role of the innate immune response in shaping the ensuing adaptive response during L. monocytogenes infection, and underscores the importance of understanding how microbes interact with the innate and adaptive immune system to control their pathogenic effects.

    **Title:** Identification of SIX6 Variants Associated with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Their Functional Consequences in Ocular Development

    **Background:** Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve atrophy. Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus (rs10483727, odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, p = 3.87×10−11).

    **Methods:** We sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants, including five rare and one common variant, Asn141His (rs33912345), which was associated significantly with POAG (OR = 1.27, p = 4.2×10−10) in the NEIGHBOR/GLAUGEN datasets. We tested these variants in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure.

    **Main Findings:** Five variants, found primarily in POAG cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. Furthermore, we identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele (Asn141).

    **Implications:** Our results, in combination with previous SIX6 work, lead us to hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying POAG and highlights the importance of SIX6 in ocular development. The identification of SIX6 variants associated with POAG and their functional consequences in ocular development has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this complex disease.

    Title: Identification of a Flagellar Switch Regulating Phase Variable Production of Flagella and Glucosylating Toxins in Clostridium difficile

    Research Question: What is the molecular mechanism controlling the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins in Clostridium difficile, a human intestinal pathogen?

    Methods: We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the regulation of flagellar gene expression and toxin production in C. difficile. We identified a 154 bp invertible sequence, termed the flagellar switch, located upstream of the flgB operon, which controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins.

    Main Findings: Bacteria with the flagellar switch in the ON orientation (flg phase ON) expressed flagellum and toxin genes, produced flagella, and secreted the toxins, whereas bacteria with the switch in the OFF orientation (flg phase OFF) were attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, were aflagellate, and showed decreased toxin secretion. The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro. We also demonstrated that gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a C. difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the flagellar switch is a key regulatory element controlling the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins in C. difficile, which are essential virulence factors for diarrheal disease development. The reversible nature of the flagellar switch implies that C. difficile can adapt to different environments by modulating its flagellar motility and toxin production.

    Conclusions: We have identified a novel regulatory mechanism controlling the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins in C. difficile. The flagellar switch, a 154 bp invertible sequence, regulates the expression of flagellum and toxin genes, impacting the production of the glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C. difficile. Our findings provide new insights into the complex regulation of virulence factors in C. difficile and highlight the importance of the flagellar switch in modulating the pathogenicity of this human intestinal pathogen.

    **Title:** Conservation and Divergence of Sporulation Sigma Factors in the Intestinal Pathogen Clostridium difficile

    **Research Question:** How do the sporulation sigma factors (σF, σE, σG, and σK) regulate endospore development in the intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile, and how do their functions compare to those in the model organism Bacillus subtilis?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic disruption and fluorescence reporter assays to study the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile. We generated mutants for each of the sigma factor genes and used a fluorescence reporter to analyze gene expression at the single-cell level.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that while the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved between C. difficile and B. subtilis, there are significant deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm. Specifically, we found that σE activity is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. Furthermore, we show that σK is not strictly required for heat-resistant spore formation. Our results also indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors, and reduced requirement for the σF-to-σE, σE-to-σG, and σG-to-σK cell-cell signaling pathways.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile have evolved distinct regulatory mechanisms compared to B. subtilis. These differences may be related to the coordination of solventogenesis, toxin production, or other functions with sporulation in C. difficile. Our results also support the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors acting as key regulators of the pathway established some 2.5 billion years ago.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of endospore development in C. difficile and highlights the complexity and diversity of sporulation sigma factors across different species within the Firmicutes phylum. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of endosporulation and the development of novel therapeutic strategies against C. difficile infections.
Title: A Compact Framework for Modeling Allosteric Multisite Phosphorylation Systems: Application to a Budding Yeast Checkpoint Signaling Pathway

Abstract:

Background: Allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins exhibit complex dose-response behaviors that are challenging to model due to the interplay between multiple phosphorylation sites. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that reduces the complexity of these systems to a single auxiliary variable, allowing for a more tractable analysis of their dynamics.

Research Question: Can a compact framework be developed to model the dose-response behavior of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins, and can this framework be applied to a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast?

Methods: We developed a mathematical framework that approximates the dynamics of allosteric multisite phosphorylation systems using a single auxiliary variable. This reduction is based on the assumption that the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant. We applied this framework to a detailed mechanistic model of a cell size checkpoint in budding yeast, which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth.

Main Findings: Our results show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating sufficient growth has occurred. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can closely replicate the steady-state behavior of detailed multisite systems, such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models.

Implications: Our compact framework provides a useful tool for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously. This framework can be extended to other types of multisite modifications, such as ligand binding, multisite transcription factor regulation, or post-translational modifications.

Conclusions: The proposed framework offers a significant simplification of allosteric multisite phosphorylation systems, allowing for a more efficient analysis of their dynamics. Our application to a budding yeast checkpoint signaling pathway demonstrates the potential of this framework to uncover novel insights into the regulation of cellular processes. Future work will focus on extending this framework to other types of multisite modifications and exploring its applications in various biochemical systems.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Mechanistic Underpinnings of Quorum Sensing in E. coli: A Systems Biology Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanistic underpinnings of the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing system in E. coli, and how do negative and positive feedback mechanisms contribute to its regulation?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental work and mathematical modeling to investigate the network connectivity and signal transduction in the AI-2 quorum sensing system of E. coli. We separated the network architecture into sub-networks and examined the interplay between circuit components and their regulation. A new negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple mathematical model.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed a previously unreported negative feedback interaction in the AI-2 quorum sensing system of E. coli. We also demonstrated the importance of the LsrR regulator and its determinant role in the E. coli QS "switch," which was previously masked by interfering regulatory loops. Our simple model allowed for a mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network.

    **Implications:** This study provides new insights into the regulation of quorum sensing in E. coli and highlights the importance of a "bottom-up" approach in understanding gene regulation. Our findings have the potential to unravel complex QS network architectures and lead to the directed coordination of emergent behaviors. Furthermore, this research may shed light on other regulatory pathways within the metabolic networks of bacterial cells and guide phenotypes in new ways as quorum sensing switches become incorporated into various biotechnological applications.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of combining experimental work and mathematical modeling to decipher the mechanistic underpinnings of complex biological systems. By separating the network architecture into sub-networks and examining the interplay between circuit components and their regulation, we were able to reveal new regulatory interactions and gain a deeper understanding of the AI-2 quorum sensing system in E. coli. This research has significant implications for our understanding of bacterial multicellularity and the development of novel biotechnological applications.
Title: Investigating the Impact of Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminths on the Prevalence and Incidence of Plasmodium falciparum Infection in School-Age Children in a Co-Endemic Region of Gabon

    Abstract:

    Background: Malaria remains a significant public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, where co-infections with helminths, such as schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), are prevalent. The effect of these co-infections on malaria infection is not well understood, with conflicting findings in the literature.

    Research Question: Does schistosomiasis and STH co-infection increase the risk and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children in a co-endemic region of Gabon?

    Methods: A longitudinal survey was conducted in two rural communities in the vicinity of Lambaréné, Gabon, among school-age children. Thick blood smear light microscopy, urine filtration, and the Kato-Katz technique were used to detect malaria parasites, S. haematobium eggs, and STH eggs, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum carriage was assessed at inclusion, and incidence of malaria and time to the first malaria event were recorded in correlation with Schistosoma carriage status.

    Main Findings: The overall prevalence of S. haematobium, P. falciparum infections, and co-infection with both parasites was 30%, 23%, and 9%, respectively. Our results showed that schistosomiasis in children tends to increase the risk of Plasmodium infection, but a combined effect with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection clearly increases the risk (aOR = 3.9 [95%CI: 1.7-9.2]). The incidence of malaria over time was 0.51 [95%CI: 0.45-0.57] per person-year and was higher in the Schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group (0.61 vs 0.43, p = 0.02), with a significant delay of time-to-first-malaria event only in children aged from 6 to 10 years old infected with Schistosoma haematobium.

    Implications: Our results suggest that STH enhance the risk for P. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and when infected, schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. These findings have significant implications for malaria control programs in co-endemic regions, highlighting the need to consider STH and schistosomiasis control as an additional tool for malaria control.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that schistosomiasis and STH co-infections cumulatively impact malaria outcome in school-age children, underscoring the importance of accounting for these co-infections when designing malaria control programs. Our results support the consideration of STH and schistosomiasis control as an additional tool for malaria control in areas of co-endemicity.

    **Title:** IRF-5-Mediated Inflammation Limits CD8+ T Cell Responses during Leishmania donovani Infection by Inducing HIF-1α in Dendritic Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during L. donovani infection using a mouse model. We analyzed the effects of IRF-5 ablation and HIF-1α depletion in CD11c+ cells on CD8+ T cell expansion, IL-12 expression, and parasite burden.

    **Main Findings:** Our data demonstrate that IRF-5-mediated inflammation limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α in dendritic cells. Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells resulted in a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells (SLEC), enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and increased IL-12 expression by splenic DCs. Moreover, mice with targeted depletion of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that IRF-5-mediated inflammation induced by Leishmania during the early stages of infection plays a detrimental role in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses. The induction of HIF-1α in dendritic cells represents an immune-evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study reveals that IRF-5-mediated inflammation limits CD8+ T cell responses during L. donovani infection by inducing HIF-1α in dendritic cells. The upregulation of HIF-1α in DCs results in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 expression, leading to a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells and enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion. These findings highlight the importance of IRF-5 and HIF-1α in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania infection and provide new insights into the immune-evasive mechanisms adopted by Leishmania parasites.
Title: Systematic Review of Prognostic Factors for Visceral Leishmaniasis in Latin America: Implications for Clinical Practice

    Abstract:
    Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) remains a significant public health concern in Latin America, characterized by high fatality rates. This systematic review aimed to identify prognostic factors associated with unfavorable outcomes and death in VL patients. We analyzed 14 studies conducted in Latin America, using a meta-analysis approach to synthesize information on prognostic variables. Our results indicate that jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections are strong predictors of adverse outcomes. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. Notably, the absence of validation procedures for existing prognostic models was a major limitation. Our findings highlight the importance of developing externally validated prognostic models to improve patient management and outcomes. The integration of results from multiple studies over the past decade has enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables, which can be used to recognize and manage VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Future research should prioritize the development of externally validated prognostic models to inform clinical practice and improve patient care.

    Research Question: What are the prognostic factors associated with unfavorable outcomes and death in patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America?

    Methods: A systematic review of 14 studies conducted in Latin America was performed, using a meta-analysis approach to synthesize information on prognostic variables.

    Main Findings: The strongest predictors of adverse outcomes were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes.

    Implications: The identification of prognostic factors associated with VL can be a valuable tool for clinical practice, enabling healthcare providers to recognize and manage patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. However, the absence of validation procedures for existing prognostic models is a major limitation.

    Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the importance of developing externally validated prognostic models to improve patient management and outcomes. The integration of results from multiple studies has enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables, which can be used to recognize and manage VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Future research should prioritize the development of externally validated prognostic models to inform clinical practice and improve patient care.

    **Title:** Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Leishmania Antimony Susceptibility in Algeria: A 30-Year Study

    **Research Question:** What is the level of antimonial susceptibility among Leishmania isolates transmitted in Algeria, and how has it changed over a 30-year period?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 106 Leishmania isolates collected between 1976 and 2013 in Algeria from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines, as well as 18 isolates from dogs in France. We determined the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (Sb(III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb(V)) in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) isolates during the 30-year period, whereas an increase in the frequency of insusceptible (S-) phenotypes in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) isolates was observed. The emergence of S- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains. The lack of well-defined antimony-resistant Leishmania field isolates and the limited number of samples available only allowed us to determine the epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) value that defined the threshold between susceptible (S+) and insusceptible (S-) parasite populations.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria and underscores the importance of preserving the therapeutic efficiency of antimonials to cure leishmaniasis by preventing the emergence of drug-resistant organisms. Our results have significant implications for the development of public health policies and the implementation of effective strategies to combat leishmaniasis in Algeria.

    **Title:** Acute Gastroenteritis and Crohn’s Disease: Unveiling the Role of Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) in Disease Onset

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanistic basis for the long-term risk of Crohn’s disease (CD) following exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis?

    **Methods:** We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, accompanied by an increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that AIEC-colonized mice that develop infectious gastroenteritis in response to either Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium have a worsened outcome compared to AIEC-naïve animals exposed to the same infection stimuli. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and susceptibility to CD, highlighting the critical role of AIEC in disease onset. These findings have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of CD, particularly in individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis.

    **Title:** Regulation of Cell Fate in Arabidopsis Female Gametophytes: Unveiling the Role of Lachesis (LIS)

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis?

    **Methods:** We conducted a screen for regulators of egg cell fate in Arabidopsis and isolated the lachesis (lis) mutant, which forms supernumerary egg cells. We analyzed the temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression and its homology to the yeast splicing factor PRP4.

    **Main Findings:** In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. Interestingly, the gametic central cell in lis-1 gametophytes also adopted egg cell fate, suggesting that a further, LIS-dependent mechanism suppresses egg cell fate in the central cell.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal two levels of cell fate regulation in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis: one between gametic and accessory cells, and one between egg and central cell. The late initiation of cell-specific marker genes indicates that in Arabidopsis, distinct cell fates are only manifested after cellularization.

    **Conclusions:** The formation of gametes is a critical step in the lifecycle of sexually reproducing organisms. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell fate in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis, highlighting the role of LIS in preventing accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate and suppressing egg cell fate in the central cell. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of plant reproductive biology and may shed light on the evolution of reproductive strategies in flowering plants.

Title: Understanding the Role of Footwear in Preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases: A Qualitative Study in a Rural Ethiopian Community

Background: Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a significant public health concern in many parts of the world, particularly in rural communities where access to healthcare is limited. Footwear has been identified as a potential tool for preventing NTDs, but little is known about the behaviors and practices surrounding shoe use in these communities.

Research Question: What are the social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological factors that influence the use of footwear in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis?

Methods: This qualitative study used a mixed-methods approach, combining focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies with 242 respondents in a rural highland Ethiopian community. The PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used to assess the social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological needs influencing shoe use.

Main Findings: The study found that shoe-wearing norms are changing in the community, with going barefoot increasingly seen as "shameful." However, many practical and social barriers prevent people from wearing shoes regularly, including limited financial resources, poor access to suitable footwear, and low perceptions of disease risk. Podoconiosis patients face additional barriers, such as difficulty finding large enough sizes and fear of stigma and labeling.

Implications: The study highlights the importance of addressing underlying structural barriers related to poverty, such as price, quality, and unsuitability of shoes for daily activities, which are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs. The findings suggest that targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing, as well as their perceived capabilities to prevent NTDs, is crucial for promoting consistent use of footwear.

Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the complex factors influencing shoe use in a rural Ethiopian community. The findings have important implications for the design and implementation of footwear programs aimed at preventing NTDs. By understanding the social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological factors that influence shoe use, we can develop targeted interventions to promote consistent use of footwear and ultimately reduce the burden of NTDs in these communities.

    **Title:** The Role of Pseudorabies Virus Us9 Protein in Lipid Raft-Mediated Axonal Sorting of Viral Proteins

    **Research Question:** How does the pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein facilitate the targeting of viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons?

    **Methods:** We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), to investigate the role of Us9 in lipid raft-mediated axonal sorting of viral proteins.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) of non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, and that this enrichment is critical for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. Moreover, reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the association of Us9 with lipid rafts is essential for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that Us9 plays a crucial role in lipid raft-mediated axonal sorting of viral proteins, and that its association with lipid rafts is critical for anterograde transmission of infection. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus transmission in the mammalian nervous system and highlight the importance of lipid rafts in viral protein sorting and trafficking. The use of PC12 cells as a model system for studying Us9 biology and lipid raft-mediated axonal sorting of viral proteins offers a valuable tool for future research in this area.

    **Significance:** This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of alpha herpesviruses in the mammalian nervous system and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat viral infections.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of Nongenetic Heterogeneity in Budding Yeast: A Role for the Ras/cAMP/PKA Pathway

    Abstract:
    The phenomenon of nongenetic heterogeneity, where genetically identical cells exhibit phenotypic variation under constant and benign conditions, has significant clinical implications in tumor and microbial infections. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying nongenetic heterogeneity in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using genetic and chemical perturbations combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, we demonstrate that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity. Our results show that lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. Furthermore, we found that the paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity, with Msn2 being required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89 significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress. Our study sheds light on the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggests a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.

    Research Question:
    What is the molecular mechanism underlying nongenetic heterogeneity in budding yeast?

    Methods:
    We used genetic and chemical perturbations combined with high-throughput single-cell assays to investigate the role of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway and its target transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, in nongenetic heterogeneity.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that heterogeneity in intracellular cAMP levels acting through the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway and its target transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, underlies nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and stress tolerance. We found that lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. Furthermore, we found that the paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity, with Msn2 being required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance.

    Implications:
    Our study has significant implications for understanding the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggests a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.

    Conclusions:
    Our results demonstrate that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway and its target transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, play a crucial role in nongenetic heterogeneity in budding yeast. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells.

    **Title:** Rapid Evolution of Chikungunya Virus in the Americas: An Intra-host Quasispecies Analysis

    **Background:** Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the Togaviridae family, has caused severe febrile disease in humans. The Asian Lineage of CHIKV emerged in the Americas in 2013, spreading rapidly throughout the New World. We investigated the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals to understand how CHIKV may have evolved during this ongoing outbreak.

    **Methods:** We employed deep-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines to characterize the minority variants and diversity present in CHIKV-infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the epidemic. We analyzed 25 viral strains from sera of infected patients, representing approximately 70% from Martinique, taken between weeks 52-2013 and week 5-2014.

    **Main Findings:** We observed changes in the consensus sequence and a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population. Notably, we found that overall diversity was dramatically reduced after single passages in cell lines. Furthermore, we constructed an infectious clone from this outbreak and identified a novel 3’ untranslated region (UTR) structure, not previously found in nature, that led to increased replication in insect cells.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the need to continue viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves in order to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV. The identification of novel variants and a new 3’UTR structure suggests that CHIKV has rapidly evolved in a short period of time once it entered this naïve population.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides an in-depth look at the minority variants present during an ongoing CHIKV epidemic, identifying novel variants and structural elements. The construction of an infectious clone of this virus will enable future studies on the pathogenesis, adaptation, and evolution of CHIKV in the Americas. Our findings underscore the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring of viral diversity to inform public health responses to emerging infectious diseases.

    **Title:** UBTOR Regulates Cell Growth and Neoplasia via mTOR Signaling

    **Research Question:** What is the role of UBTOR, a previously unannotated gene, in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling, and how does it contribute to neoplasia?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the function of UBTOR in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. Cultured hippocampal neurons, PC12 cells, and cancer cell lines (HEK293T, U87MG, and T24) were used to examine the effects of UBTOR depletion and overexpression on cell growth and mTOR signaling. Zebrafish and xenograft mouse models were used to study the role of UBTOR in neoplasia.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that UBTOR depletion promotes neurite outgrowth, cell growth, and mTOR signaling in cultured cells. Conversely, UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR, a component of the mTOR complex, to inhibit mTOR signaling. In zebrafish, disruption of the ubtor gene upregulates mTOR signaling and promotes HRAS(G12V)-mediated tumor formation. Furthermore, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that UBTOR is a functional player in regulating cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling. The results suggest that UBTOR acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing DEPTOR and inhibiting mTOR signaling. The enhancement of HRAS(G12V)-mediated tumor formation in homozygous ubtor zebrafish mutants and larger xenograft tumor growth of UBTOR-depleted U87MG cells in nude mice further support the involvement of UBTOR in neoplasia.

    **Conclusions:** Our study identifies UBTOR as a previously unannotated gene that regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neoplasia and highlight the potential of UBTOR as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

    Title: Systematic Analysis of Protein Complexes in Trypanosoma brucei Reveals Novel Insights into Parasite Biology and Pathogenesis

    Background: Trypanosomatid parasites, including Trypanosoma brucei, are responsible for human African trypanosomiasis, a fatal disease with significant economic and public health implications. Despite their importance, the functions of the majority of trypanosomatid-specific proteins remain unknown, hindering our understanding of parasite biology and pathogenesis.

    Research Question: What are the protein-protein interactions and complexes in the procyclic life stage of Trypanosoma brucei, and how do these interactions contribute to parasite biology and pathogenesis?

    Methods: We employed in-depth biochemical fractionation and a rigorous methodology to systematically interrogate the co-complex interactions of over 3,354 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei.

    Main Findings: Our analysis led to the identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation. These complexes correlated well with known pathways and proteins co-expressed across the T. brucei life cycle, providing potential functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized proteins. We validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery, including a candidate potentially involved in mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei.

    Implications: Our study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date, providing a valuable resource for formulating new biological hypotheses and experimental leads. The protein complex map revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei, which were validated by independent experiments.

    Conclusions: This study provides an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T. brucei, serving as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. Our findings have significant implications for understanding parasite biology and pathogenesis, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies against human African trypanosomiasis.

    **Title:** Dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection in Thoracic Lymph Nodes: A Comparative Study in Cynomolgus and Rhesus Macaques

    **Research Question:** How does Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection affect the structure and function of thoracic lymph nodes (LNs) in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, and what are the implications for disease progression and treatment?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive study of thoracic LNs in Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques using PET CT scans, bacterial burden analysis, LN structure examination, and immune function assessment.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Mtb infection in thoracic LNs is a dynamic process, with varying trajectories of PET activity over time, even within the same animal. We found that rhesus macaques are more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques, with more extensive LN pathology and higher bacterial burden. However, Mtb grows to the same level in LNs of both species, but cynomolgus macaques control the infection better than rhesus macaques at later time points post-infection. Notably, LNs are poor at killing Mtb, even with drug treatment, and granulomas that form in LNs disrupt LN structure and introduce niches for Mtb persistence.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that thoracic LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection but also serve as important sites for Mtb persistence. The differences in LN pathology and bacterial burden between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques highlight the need for species-specific approaches to understanding and treating Mtb infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the dynamics of Mtb infection in thoracic LNs and highlights the importance of LNs as sites of Mtb persistence. Our findings have implications for the development of more effective treatments and diagnostic tools for Mtb infection, particularly in rhesus macaques, which are more susceptible to the disease. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the differences in LN pathology and bacterial burden between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Diversity and Ubiquity of Microsporidian Infections in Nematodes

    **Research Question:** How widespread and diverse are microsporidian infections in Caenorhabditis elegans and other related nematodes in the wild?

    **Methods:** We isolated and cultured 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections from the wild and performed phylogenetic analysis to identify the microsporidian species.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that Nematocida parisii is the most common microsporidian infecting C. elegans in the wild. We also describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus, as well as two new subclades, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, which are genetically distinct from Nematocida and belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. We found that these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga, which replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, providing a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts. We also show that host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others, and that some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and vice versa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the biology and ecology of microsporidian infections in nematodes and highlight the importance of studying these obligate intracellular parasites in their natural hosts. The newly isolated species and subclades described in this study will serve as a valuable resource for future research on host-parasite interactions and the evolution of microsporidian infections in nematodes.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into Chemokine Receptor Homo- and Heterodimerization: A Molecular Dynamics Study

    **Research Question:** How do chemokine receptors, specifically CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2, homo- and heterodimerize, and how does membrane cholesterol influence these interactions?

    **Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the spontaneous homo- and heterodimerization of chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 in cholesterol-free and -rich membranes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 exhibit similar homodimerization patterns, distinct from those of CXCR4. Cholesterol modulates the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner, increasing the dynamic range and versatility of associations between closely related transmembrane receptors. Heterodimerization of chemokine receptors displays distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2, with associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 showing increased cholesterol-sensitivity compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization.

    **Implications:** This study provides a comprehensive structural overview of the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors, highlighting the importance of cholesterol in regulating receptor function and dimerization. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the role of chemokine receptors in cancer metastasis and HIV-infection, as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these receptors.

    **Conclusions:** Our molecular dynamics simulations provide a detailed understanding of the structural basis of chemokine receptor homo- and heterodimerization, shedding light on the complex interplay between these receptors and the membrane environment. The results of this study will contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting chemokine receptors, which are involved in various diseases, including cancer and HIV-infection.

    **Title:** Unveiling an Atypical Form of Systemic Leishmaniasis: A Novel Clinical Picture

    **Background:** Systemic leishmaniasis, also known as visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-Azar, is a severe and potentially fatal disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The classical form of the disease presents with prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. However, a sub-clinical form has been identified, characterized by the absence of one or two of these symptoms, accompanied by other findings such as lymphadenopathy and anemia.

    **Research Question:** What is the prevalence and clinical presentation of an atypical form of systemic leishmaniasis, and how does it differ from the classical and sub-clinical forms?

    **Methods:** We conducted a retrospective study of 160 patients referred to our immunology laboratory for evaluation of immune function. Patients underwent multiple specialized tests, including microscopic examinations and cultures of biopsies on various media.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 19.4% of patients with near-normal laboratory profiles but dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites. These patients presented with an atypical form of systemic leishmaniasis, characterized by symptoms masquerading as a non-functional immune system, leading to recurrent secondary infections.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that systemic leishmaniasis presents with a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected and is more common than diagnosed to date. The atypical form of the disease is not limited to the pediatric age group, as we observed a significant number of adult patients.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel clinical picture of systemic leishmaniasis, which should be considered in patients with unexplained depressed immunity and no obvious immunologic defect. We recommend that clinicians entertain the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in such cases, as it may lead to timely and effective treatment. Our findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and management of systemic leishmaniasis, and highlight the need for further research into the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this disease.

    **Title:** Leveraging Paralogous Proteins to Identify Disease-Causing Variants: A Novel Approach to Predicting Phenotypic Consequences

    **Research Question:** Can variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins be used to identify polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences and extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization?

    **Methods:** We assembled a unique collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins.

    **Main Findings:** Our analyses demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins, and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. We found that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance, suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous protein sequences result in coordinated distributions of both disease and non-disease-causing variants along their lengths.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that paralogous human genes and their variant-pairs can be used for hypothesis generation and as points of departure for further clinical research. Extending this procedure to include paralogs of known disease genes, that are not themselves yet associated with any disease, could be used to identify new disease gene candidates, and to identify uncharacterized variants within them likely to have phenotypic consequences.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a novel approach to predicting the phenotypic consequences of sequence variants by leveraging paralogous proteins. This approach can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Our findings highlight the potential of paralogous proteins as a source of additional information for in silico variation characterization, complementing existing algorithms such as SIFT and PolyPhen.

    **Title:** Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Altered Gene Expression in Plasmodium falciparum Parasites Causing Severe Malaria

    **Research Question:** How do Plasmodium falciparum parasites adapt to or are selected by the host environment in severe malaria?

    **Methods:** We employed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze gene expression in 44 parasite isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that parasites causing severe malaria exhibited decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure, reduced surface expression of PfEMP1, and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Notably, we identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments, as well as confirmed previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for the development of vaccine targets for severe malaria. The reduced expression of PfEMP1, a major target of protective immunity, may explain why immunity to severe malaria is acquired more rapidly than immunity to uncomplicated malaria.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of Plasmodium falciparum parasites to the host environment in severe malaria. The identification of novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and sequence segments will inform the development of effective vaccine strategies to prevent severe malaria. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the host environment selects for parasites that down-regulate PfEMP1 expression, which may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. These results will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between the parasite and the host, ultimately leading to the development of more effective interventions against this devastating disease.

    **Title:** Long-term Delivery of Potent Broadly-Neutralizing Antibodies via AAV Vector for HIV-1 Prevention

    **Research Question:** Can long-term delivery of potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector effectively prevent HIV-1 infection in rhesus monkeys?

    **Methods:** We used AAV vector to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG1 form to rhesus monkeys via intramuscular injection. We measured the levels of delivered mAb and host antibody responses to the delivered antibody.

    **Main Findings:** We achieved persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 μg/ml, but host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered antibody. Despite this, the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed clear protective effects against SIVmac239 challenge, including lowering of viral load at peak height, set point, and delay in time to peak viral load. The monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 challenges, including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i.v. infectious units.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people. However, the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized.

    **Conclusions:** Long-term delivery of potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies via AAV vector is a promising approach for HIV-1 prevention. While host antibody responses to the delivered antibody limited the concentration of delivered antibody, the protective effects observed in this study suggest that this approach could be effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. Further research is needed to understand and overcome the problem of anti-antibody responses and to explore the potential of this approach for HIV-1 prevention in humans.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Linearity Assumption in Protein Dynamics: A Study on Myosin V and Kinesin KIF1A

    **Research Question:** Do protein molecules respond linearly to thermal noise or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, as traditionally assumed in protein dynamics studies?

    **Methods:** We performed numerical investigations of conformational relaxation properties in two motor proteins, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, using the coarse-grained elastic network approximation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we found that the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions in KIF1A, while in myosin V, slow conformational relaxation motions can still be qualitatively characterized in terms of normal modes.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. The breakdown of the normal mode description does not imply that conformational motions become irregular; instead, ordered and robust mechanochemical motions are characteristic of both protein motors, even though they cannot be described in terms of linear response.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that nonlinear effects play an essential role in the conformational relaxation properties of myosin V and KIF1A. For KIF1A, nonlinear effects dominate completely functional mechanochemical motions, which are qualitatively different from the normal mode predictions. Despite nonlinearity, well-defined conformational relaxation paths, robust against perturbations, have been found in both motor proteins. These results have significant implications for our understanding of protein dynamics and highlight the need to reconsider the linearity assumption in protein dynamics studies.

    **Significance:** This study provides new insights into the conformational relaxation processes associated with ligand binding and hydrolysis in motor proteins, challenging the traditional view of protein dynamics as a linear response to thermal noise or structural perturbations.
Title: Regulation of Clathrin-Independent Endocytosis by Caveolar Proteins: A Novel Mechanism of Crosstalk between Endocytic Pathways

    Abstract:
    Clathrin-independent endocytic pathways, such as the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment (CLIC/GEEC) pathway, have been poorly understood due to the lack of specific regulators and cargo. Here, we investigate the role of caveolar proteins in regulating CLIC/GEEC endocytosis. Our results show that Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, are potent inhibitors of the CLIC/GEEC pathway in a process independent of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression. Expression of caveolar proteins leads to a reduction in the formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers, as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis. Furthermore, the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components, as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. We also found that noncaveolar Cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42. This work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of caveolar proteins in regulating clathrin-independent endocytosis, specifically the CLIC/GEEC pathway?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemical techniques to investigate the role of caveolar proteins in regulating CLIC/GEEC endocytosis. We used quantitative electron microscopy analysis, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies, and ectopic expression of caveolar proteins to examine the effects of caveolar proteins on CLIC/GEEC endocytosis.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, are potent inhibitors of the CLIC/GEEC pathway in a process independent of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression. Expression of caveolar proteins leads to a reduction in the formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers. The CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways. The identification of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 as inhibitors of the CLIC/GEEC pathway highlights the importance of caveolar proteins in regulating endocytic trafficking. Our results also suggest that caveolae play a role in spatial organization of the CLIC/GEEC pathway in migrating cells.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism of crosstalk between endocytic pathways, where caveolar proteins regulate clathrin-independent endocytosis through the CLIC/GEEC pathway

    **Title:** Discovery of Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) Domains: A Novel Subclass of Two-Component Signaling Systems

    **Research Question:** What is the prevalence and functional role of Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains, which lack the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue essential for phosphorylation in two-component signaling systems?

    **Methods:** We compiled a comprehensive dataset of REC domains missing the phosphorylatable Asp residue, which we termed Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. We analyzed this dataset using informatics, structural, biochemical, and genetic approaches, including the study of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that ALRs are surprisingly common, comprising approximately 4% of all REC domains, and are enriched for when attached to rare effector outputs. We found that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while retaining canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interfaces.

    **Implications:** This study defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains. Our findings suggest that ALRs have diversified to accommodate various signaling inputs, including binding small molecules, Ser-Thr phosphorylation by bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases, and Arg phosphorylation by arginine-specific kinases.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of ALRs expands our understanding of two-component signaling systems and highlights the diversity of mechanisms employed by these systems to sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Our study provides a foundation for further research into the functional roles of ALRs in bacteria, Archaea, and plants, and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling systems.

Title: Efficacy and Safety of HER2-Retargeted, Fully-Virulent Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses in Immunocompetent Mice

Background: Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) have shown promise in clinical trials as a novel anticancer therapy. However, most oHSVs rely on deletions or mutations to gain cancer-specificity, which can lead to attenuation or over-attenuation. To address this limitation, we developed next-generation oHSVs that retain their full virulence while targeting cancer cells through specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors, such as HER2.

Methods: We investigated the efficacy and safety of HER2-retargeted, fully-virulent oHSVs in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice and HER2-transgenic/tolerant counterparts. We injected wt-HSV-1 (F), R-LM113, and R-115 intraperitoneally and evaluated their ability to inhibit the growth of primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 (HER2-LLC1) tumors.

Findings: Both R-LM113 and R-115 inhibited the growth of primary tumors, with R-115 being more efficacious. Notably, mice that survived the primary treated tumors were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors, indicating an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis of the local response revealed that R-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines, including IFNγ and T-bet, which promoted Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, such as CD4+, CD335+, and CD8+ cells, were increased in responders, while CD11b+ cells were decreased preferentially in R-115-treated mice.

Implications: Our results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of HER2-retargeted, fully-virulent oHSVs in immunocompetent mice. The durable response included a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and wild-type tumor cells, underscoring a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response. These findings have significant implications for the development of next-generation oHSVs as a novel anticancer therapy.

Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence of the efficacy of HER2-retargeted, fully-virulent oHSVs in immunocompetent mice. The high safety profile of these viruses, combined with their ability to elicit a local immune response and induce an abscopal effect, makes them an attractive candidate for further clinical development.
Title: Differential HIV Susceptibility of Vector-Specific CD4 T Cells Induced by Adenovirus 5 and ALVAC Viral Vectors in HIV Vaccination

    Abstract:

    Background: The use of adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-based HIV vaccines has been associated with increased HIV infections in some clinical trials, highlighting the need to understand host responses to vaccine vectors and the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells. Our previous study demonstrated that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells induced by Ad5 vaccination are susceptible to HIV. Here, we investigated the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC, a canarypox viral vector used in the Thai trial RV144, compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in the HVTN204 trial.

    Methods: We analyzed the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from RV144 and HVTN204 trial participants using in vitro infection assays. We also examined the surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, as well as the cytokine profiles and phenotypes of vector-specific CD4 T cells.

    Main Findings: We found that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV infection in vitro compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in HVTN204 PBMC. The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with reduced surface expression of CCR5 and CXCR4. Phenotypic analyses revealed that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1β) but little IL-17. Notably, ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation, while Ad5 vector induced CD4 T-cell proliferation.

    Implications: Our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination. The findings suggest that ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells may play a protective role against HIV infection of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors exhibit marked differences in their susceptibility to HIV infection, with ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells being less susceptible than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells. These findings have significant implications for the development of effective HIV vaccines and highlight the need for a better understanding of anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
Title: Evolutionary Diversification of X Inactivation Strategies in Therian Mammals: A Theoretical Analysis of Dominance, Linkage, Recombination, and Sex-Differential Selection

Abstract:

X inactivation, the transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome copy per female somatic cell, is a universal phenomenon among therian mammals. However, the choice of which X chromosome to silence exhibits considerable variation among species, ranging from strict paternally inherited X inactivation (PXI) to unbiased random X inactivation (RXI). To elucidate the underlying evolutionary processes driving this diversity, we conducted a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution. Our results indicate that a critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad and continuous range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. We found that RXI is favored over complete PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive, and the criteria for RXI evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic. Furthermore, evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. These findings provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.

Our analysis suggests that species-specific properties of mutation and genetic variation can predictably affect patterns of selection for different X inactivation strategies. We propose that sex differences in selection, where the fitness effects of single mutations differ in magnitude or direction between males and females, can influence the evolutionary diversification of X inactivation strategies. Stronger selection against deleterious alleles in males compared to females should decrease the average proportion of deleterious alleles carried on each paternally derived X. We also examine whether sex-differential selection might favor the evolution of biased X inactivation strategies and predict the magnitude of biases likely to evolve. Our results suggest that conditions for evolving biased inactivation patterns are extremely permissive.

These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of X inactivation strategies in therian mammals. They provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.
Title: Identification of Japanese Encephalitis Virus as the First ZAP-Sensitive Flavivirus and Elucidation of the Antiviral Mechanism of ZAP Against Viral Infection

    Abstract:
    The CCCH-type zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host factor that restricts the infection of various viruses through RNA degradation, translation inhibition, and innate immune responses. However, only one flavivirus, yellow fever virus (YFV), has been reported to be ZAP-resistant. Here, we investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP (isoform ZAP-L and ZAP-S) against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Our results show that overexpression of ZAP blocks JEV infection, while depletion of endogenous ZAP enhances JEV replication. We found that ZAP targets JEV translation and induces 3′-5′ RNA exosome-mediated degradation of viral RNA. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP are essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. Notably, the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of JEV, particularly the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide, is responsible for binding to ZAP and conferring sensitivity to ZAP. Our study identifies JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus and provides insight into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral infection. These findings suggest that ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection.

    Methods:
    We used a combination of molecular biology techniques, including immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, and Western blotting, to investigate the antiviral activity of ZAP against JEV, DENV, and ZIKV. We generated constructs expressing ZAP-L and ZAP-S with or without zinc-finger motifs and tested their ability to bind to JEV RNA. We also measured the mRNA levels of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines in A549 cells with or without ZAP overexpression.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that overexpression of ZAP blocks JEV infection, while depletion of endogenous ZAP enhances JEV replication. We found that ZAP targets JEV translation and induces 3′-5′ RNA exosome-mediated degradation of viral RNA. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP are essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. Notably, the 3′-UTR of JEV is responsible for binding to ZAP and conferring sensitivity to ZAP.

    Implications:
    Our study identifies JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus and provides insight into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral infection. These findings suggest that ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study highlights the antiviral potential of ZAP against JEV and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral infection. The identification of JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against flavivirus infections.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Host Response to Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) Infection in C57BL/6 Mice: A Study of Wild-Type and Attenuated Vaccine Strains

Background: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic pathogen causing severe disease in humans and livestock, with significant concerns regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions. Understanding the host response to RVFV infection is crucial for developing effective vaccines and treatments.

Research Question: What are the clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type RVFV strain ZH501 and attenuated vaccine strain MP-12 in C57BL/6 mice, and how do these responses correlate with viral pathogenesis?

Methods: Adult C57BL/6 mice were infected with either live-attenuated MP-12 or wild-type ZH501 RVFV strains. Clinical parameters, cytokine and chemokine responses, and tissue pathology were evaluated over the course of infection.

Main Findings: Mice infected with MP-12 survived productive viral infection with minimal clinical disease and cytokine response, whereas ZH501 infection was lethal, causing lymphopenia, platelet depletion, and a strong systemic cytokine response. Histological analysis revealed significant liver necrosis and hepatitis in ZH501-infected mice, with a chemokine response indicative of immunoreactive cell infiltration. In contrast, MP-12-infected mice showed minimal liver pathology.

Implications: These findings suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver dysfunction due to necrosis and hepatitis, while the long-term course of disease is neurologic in nature, supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the host response to RVFV infection differs significantly between wild-type and attenuated vaccine strains. The attenuated MP-12 strain elicits a minimal immune response, whereas the wild-type ZH501 strain causes a strong, systemic cytokine response and significant tissue pathology. These findings have important implications for the development of effective RVFV vaccines and treatments, and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms of RVFV pathogenesis.

    **Title:** C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) mediates taxane chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through a positive feedback loop involving NF-κB and ABCB1

    **Research Question:** What is the role of C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) in mediating taxane chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of CCL20 in breast cancer patients undergoing taxane-containing chemotherapy and examined its effects on breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that CCL20 was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. We found that CCL20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenance of BCSCs through protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Furthermore, CCL20-promoted NF-κB activation increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression, leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that chemotherapy-induced CCL20 mediates chemoresistance via up-regulating ABCB1. Moreover, NF-κB activation increased CCL20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways, which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our studies offer a novel strategy to solve taxane resistance in breast cancer, including TNBC—that is, the combination of taxane treatment and the adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 may greatly improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients.

    Title: Identification of Novel Proteins Essential for Toxoplasma gondii Effector Transport Across the Parasitophorous Vacuole Membrane

    Background: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. The parasite's ability to manipulate its host cell is dependent on its ability to transport effector proteins, such as GRA16 and GRA24, across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) into the host cell.

    Research Question: What proteins are necessary for the transport of effector proteins across the PVM in Toxoplasma gondii?

    Methods: We screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 into the host cell nucleus. We identified two novel proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, that play a crucial role in the translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell.

    Main Findings: MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1. Consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains, all three proteins are membrane-associated, and MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1, whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked. We further show that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport.

    Implications: These results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell. The identification of MYR2 and MYR3 provides new insights into the molecular machinery required for Toxoplasma's ability to hijack and persist in its host.

    Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in the transport of effector proteins across the PVM in Toxoplasma gondii. These results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Toxoplasma's ability to manipulate its host cell and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Toxoplasma infections.

    **Title:** Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Bovine Papillomavirus (BPV-1) E2 Proteins Interact with Origin Recognition Complex 2 (ORC2) to Regulate Viral Replication

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Origin Recognition Complex 2 (ORC2) in the replication of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Bovine Papillomavirus (BPV-1)?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between HPV and BPV-1 E2 proteins and ORC2 using co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We also examined the effect of ORC2 depletion on viral replication in transient replication assays and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes.

    **Main Findings:** We found that HPV and BPV-1 E2 proteins bind to ORC2, but ORC2 is not present at the viral origin. Depletion of ORC2 enhanced viral replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes, while there was no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes. Furthermore, we observed that over-expression of HPV E2 decreased ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that ORC2 is not necessary for activation of the PV origin by E1 and E2 but instead suppresses E2 replicative function. We infer that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of E2 that occur during the differentiation-dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and hence DNA synthesis at cellular origins.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HPV and BPV-1 replication and highlights the complex interplay between viral and host replication factors. Our findings have implications for understanding the regulation of viral replication and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target viral replication.
Title: Widespread Detection of Brucella DNA in Bovine Milk in the Urban and Peri-Urban Area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan: Implications for Public Health and Livestock Control

    Abstract:
    Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Brucella, remains a significant public health concern globally, particularly in low-income countries where urban and peri-urban farming practices are common. This study aimed to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, a region known to be a Brucella hotspot. Using IS711-based real-time PCR, Brucella DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples, highlighting the need for improved surveillance and control measures. Notably, Brucella DNA was found in the milk of both seropositive and seronegative cows, with 8.3% of seronegative cows testing positive. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene revealed that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was likely infected with B. melitensis. These findings underscore the importance of implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programs. Furthermore, the study suggests that vaccination of cattle with S19, in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1, may be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population. However, further research is required to isolate Brucella and obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in this region. The results of this study have significant implications for public health and livestock control, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to prevent the transmission of Brucella from animals to humans.

    Research Question:
    What is the prevalence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, and what are the implications for public health and livestock control?

    Methods:
    A total of 564 cow milk samples were collected from 326 herds in 21 villages in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. IS711-based real-time PCR was used to detect Brucella DNA, and sequence analysis of the rpoB gene was performed to identify the Brucella species.

    Main Findings:
    Brucella DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples, with 100% of seropositive cows and 8.3% of seronegative cows testing positive. Sequence analysis revealed that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was likely infected with B. melitensis.

    Implications:
    The study highlights the need for improved surveillance and control measures to prevent the transmission of Brucella from animals to humans. The findings suggest that vaccination of cattle with S19, in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1, may be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population.

    Conclusions:
    The widespread detection of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, underscores the importance of targeted interventions to prevent the transmission of Brucella from animals to humans. Further research is required to isolate Brucella and obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in this region.

    **Title:** Heterochromatin and Genome Stability in Zymoseptoria tritici: Unraveling the Role of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3

    **Research Question:** What is the role of heterochromatin, specifically H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, in maintaining genome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental evolution and genomic analyses to investigate the impact of deleting the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 (kmt1) and H3K27me3 (kmt6) in Z. tritici. We generated a double mutant and used whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure, and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that H3K9me3 is crucial for maintaining genome stability in Z. tritici, as its absence leads to dramatic chromatin reorganization, genome rearrangements, and the formation of new chromosomes, accompanied by the activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss of H3K27me3 actually increases the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro, without large-scale changes in gene activity.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that H3K9me3 plays a key role in maintaining genome stability by disallowing H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. The presence of H3K27me3, on the other hand, reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, generating a "metastable" state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between heterochromatin and genome stability in Z. tritici. Our results highlight the importance of H3K9me3 in maintaining genome integrity and provide a basis for future studies on the influence of heterochromatin on structural genome rearrangements using Z. tritici as a model organism.
Title: Enhancing Accessibility and Affordability of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Rabies Prevention: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

    Abstract:

    Background: Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a critical intervention for preventing the fatal onset of rabies in individuals exposed to the virus. However, the accessibility and affordability of life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals remain significant barriers, particularly for the poorest sectors of society who bear the largest burden of rabies.

    Research Question: What are the relative costs and benefits of different PEP vaccination regimens, and how can their accessibility and affordability be improved?

    Methods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of different PEP vaccination regimens, including intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) administration, from the perspective of healthcare providers. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of dollars per rabies death averted.

    Main Findings: Our analysis revealed that PEP vaccination is an extremely cost-effective intervention, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $200 to less than $60 per death averted. Switching from IM to ID administration resulted in significant savings in vaccine volume and costs, which could mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce healthcare provider costs. We also identified financing mechanisms that could make PEP more affordable and accessible, including subsidies for those in need and support for rabies control and prevention programs.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths and economic benefits for healthcare providers.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the need to prioritize increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and preventing delays in PEP delivery, particularly for the poorest sectors of society. By adopting ID administration and implementing financing mechanisms, we can make PEP more accessible and affordable, ultimately reducing the burden of rabies and saving lives.
Title: Exploitation of Host Lipid Droplets by Toxoplasma: A Novel Mechanism of Nutrient Acquisition

    Abstract:
    Toxoplasma, an obligate intracellular parasite, has developed a unique mechanism to acquire nutrients by attracting host organelles, including lipid droplets (LD), to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Here, we investigated the role of host LD in Toxoplasma replication and nutrient acquisition. Our results show that Toxoplasma replication is significantly reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes (ADRP, DGAT2) increase until the onset of parasite replication. Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD. We demonstrate that Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes host LD within the PV, which are then wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD. Moreover, parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV. Our findings highlight the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and the parasite’s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host LD. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Toxoplasma’s nutrient acquisition and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this parasite.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of host lipid droplets in Toxoplasma replication and nutrient acquisition?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches to investigate the role of host LD in Toxoplasma replication and nutrient acquisition. We infected host cells with Toxoplasma and analyzed the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes. We also examined the ability of Toxoplasma to access lipids stored in host LD and incorporate these lipids into its own membranes and LD.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Toxoplasma replication is significantly reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. We also demonstrate that Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes host LD within the PV, which are then wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD. Moreover, parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and the parasite’s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host LD. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Toxoplasma’s nutrient acquisition and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this parasite.

    Conclusions:
    Toxoplasma has developed a unique mechanism to acquire nutrients by exploiting host LD, which are essential for its intracellular development. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Toxoplasma’s nutrient acquisition and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this parasite.
Title: Identification of Novel Chalcone Derivatives as Inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica Cysteine Proteases: Implications for the Control of Fasciolosis

    Abstract:
    Fasciolosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, has emerged as a significant public health concern due to increased reports of human infections. Chemotherapy is the primary control measure, with triclabendazole being the preferred drug. However, resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in several countries, necessitating the search for new chemical entities and target molecules to control fluke infections. We screened a library of 40 flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of key stage-specific Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases (FhCL3 and FhCL1) and identified chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphthyl groups as potent cathepsin L inhibitors. One compound, C34, exhibited an IC50 of 5.6 μM against juvenile-specific FhCL3 and interacted with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues, determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases. Notably, C34 induced a reduction in the ability of newly excysted juveniles (NEJ) to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility phenotype, leading to NEJ death within a week in vitro, without being cytotoxic to bovine cells. These findings highlight the potential of chalcones as novel inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsins and open new avenues for the development of innovative drugs to control fluke infections and possibly other helminthic diseases.

    **Title:** Differential Temporal Filtering in the Inner Retina: Unveiling the Role of Bipolar Cell Synaptic Terminals in Visual Signal Transmission

    **Research Question:** How do bipolar cells in the inner retina transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways?

    **Methods:** We employed in vivo imaging and whole-cell recordings to investigate the role of bipolar cell synaptic terminals in transmitting visual signals to the inner retina. We used a combination of calcium imaging and electrophysiology to study the dynamics of presynaptic calcium signals and vesicle release in response to varying light intensities and frequencies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters, allowing individual cells to transmit through multiple terminals varying in size. Smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. We found that smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively. Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to these differences in response dynamics.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of visual signal transmission in the inner retina, highlighting the importance of synaptic terminal geometry and calcium dynamics in shaping the output of bipolar cells. These results have implications for our understanding of how the visual system processes fast and slow changes in light intensity, and how this information is transmitted to higher visual centers.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that bipolar cells can transmit different temporal components of the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with distinct adaptational properties. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of visual processing and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for visual disorders related to retinal dysfunction.
Title: Development of a Novel Probabilistic Synapse Detector for High-Throughput Structural and Molecular Profiling of Diverse Synapse Populations

    Abstract:
    The exploration of the brain's vast synaptic networks requires innovative tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of diverse synapse populations. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. To address this challenge, we developed and tested a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detecting synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data using conjugate array tomography (cAT) datasets. Our probabilistic synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. We evaluated our method by comparing it to EM gold standard annotated data and examining its capacity to reproduce known features of cortical synapse distributions. Our results show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.

    Research Question:
    Can a novel unsupervised probabilistic method detect synapses from multiplex FM image data with high accuracy and reproduce known features of cortical synapse distributions?

    Methods:
    We used conjugate array tomography (cAT) datasets, which provide voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. Our probabilistic synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions.

    Implications:
    This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. Reliable, high-throughput methods for large-scale synapse detection will also help to analyze volume images large enough to contain complete neural arbors, and thus to allow discernment of the relationships between detected synapses and their presynaptic and postsynaptic parent neurons.

    Conclusions:
    Our novel probabilistic synapse detector is a valuable tool for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of diverse synapse populations. Its ability to detect synapses from muxFM data with high accuracy and reproduce known features of cortical synapse distributions makes it a promising approach for data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of ZnT2: A Proton-Coupled Zinc Antiporter in Vesicular Zinc Accumulation

Abstract:
Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression, and immune system function. However, impairment of zinc homeostasis can lead to various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport is mediated by two transporter families, ZnT and ZIP, with ZnT2 being responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2 remains unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of ZnT2 using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our results demonstrate that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter, which accumulates zinc in intracellular vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm. Using functional zinc transport assays, we showed that Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase, abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we used LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin to show that ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc resulted in vesicular pH alkalization, which was reversed in the presence of TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. Computational energy calculations suggest that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ion. Our findings provide evidence that ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm. These results have significant implications for our understanding of zinc homeostasis and the development of therapeutic strategies for zinc-related disorders.

    **Title:** 14-3-3 Proteins Regulate Replication Fork Stability and Progression through Exonuclease 1 Phosphorylation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of 14-3-3 proteins in regulating replication fork stability and progression under DNA replication stress?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical, genetic, and microscopic approaches to investigate the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) in yeast and mammalian cells. We used yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and electron microscopy to identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1. We also used DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis to analyze fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations.

    **Main Findings:** We found that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the phosphorylation status of Exo1, a nuclease involved in processing stalled replication forks. In yeast 14-3-3 deficient cells, we observed an accumulation of Exo1-dependent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at stalled forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. Furthermore, we showed that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression and stability under conditions of limiting nucleotide availability.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress. We propose that 14-3-3 proteins act as central integrators of signals that regulate fork stability and processing.

    **Conclusions:** This study sheds light on the processes occurring at stalled replication forks and highlights the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in regulating replication fork stability and progression. Future challenges include identifying the components of the replisome that may be 14-3-3 targets and elucidating the exact mechanism by which 14-3-3 modulate Exo1 phosphorylation and activity. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of genome stability and the regulation of DNA replication.

    **Title:** Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDC) Play Opposing Roles in HIV-1 Infection and Pathogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis?

    **Methods:** We used a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection and developed a monoclonal antibody (15B) that specifically depletes human pDC in lymphoid organs. We infected humanized mice with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CXCR4-dual tropic HIV-1 or a standard CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate.

    **Main Findings:** Depletion of pDC prior to HIV-1 infection abolished the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during acute HIV-1 infection. Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. However, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and promoting HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis. The depletion of pDC and IFN-I blockade may provide novel strategies for treating HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that pDC are critical IFN-I producer cells that contribute to suppressing HIV-1 replication during early HIV-1 infection. However, pDC also enhance HIV-1 pathogenesis by promoting cell death of human leukocytes, including human CD4 and CD8 T cells. These findings highlight the complex role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis, and suggest that targeting pDC and IFN-I may be a promising therapeutic approach for HIV-1 treatment.
Title: Activation of Nuclear Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) by Sulforaphane Reprograms Cellular Gene Expression to Block HIV Infection in Primary Macrophages

    Abstract:
    The Marburg virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and Dengue virus have been shown to activate and benefit from the expression of Nuclear Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription regulator of anti-oxidant genes. However, the impact of Nrf2 activation on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has remained unexplored. Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound produced in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage, has been found to mobilize Nrf2 and reprogram cellular gene expression. Here, we investigate the role of SFN in modulating HIV infection in primary macrophages and T cells. Our results show that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 boosts HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduces the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment, suggesting that Nrf2 mediates the anti-viral activity of SFN. We also found that SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, similar to the type I interferon-induced cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2. Notably, neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 were upregulated, indicating that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection through a novel mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of SFN as a therapeutic agent to trigger Nrf2-mediated inhibition of HIV infection in myeloid-derived cells, including primary macrophages.

    Research Question: Does Sulforaphane (SFN) modulate HIV infection in primary macrophages and T cells through the activation of Nuclear Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2)?

    Methods: Primary macrophages and T cells were treated with SFN, and HIV infection was assessed using luciferase activity assays. siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 was used to investigate the role of Nrf2 in SFN-mediated anti-viral activity.

    Main Findings: SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. Nrf2 depletion boosts HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduces the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment. SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, similar to SAMHD1 and MX2.

    Implications: These findings suggest that SFN can be used as a therapeutic agent to trigger Nrf2-mediated inhibition of HIV infection in myeloid-derived cells, including primary macrophages.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages through the activation of Nrf2, a transcription regulator of anti-oxidant genes. The findings highlight the potential of SFN as a therapeutic agent to modulate HIV infection and provide new insights into the mechanisms of Nrf2-mediated anti-viral activity.
Title: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Geohelminth Infections among Pregnant Women in Rural Western Kenya: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Survey

    Abstract:
    Geohelminth infections are a significant public health concern in rural western Kenya, particularly among pregnant women. This community-based cross-sectional survey aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of geohelminth infections among pregnant women, as well as their effects on symptoms, anemia, and nutritional status. A total of 390 pregnant women were interviewed and provided a blood sample and a single fecal sample. Geohelminth infections were identified using the concentration and Kato-Katz method. The results showed that 76.2% of the participants were infected with at least one geohelminth species, with Ascaris lumbricoides (52.3%), hookworm (39.5%), and Trichuris trichiura (29.0%) being the most prevalent. Infection with at least one geohelminth species was associated with the use of an unprotected water source (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.0) and the lack of treatment of drinking water (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Notably, hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference (adjusted mean decrease 0.7 cm, 95% CI 0.3-1.2 cm). Furthermore, hookworm infections with an egg count ≥1000/gram feces (11 women) were associated with lower hemoglobin levels (adjusted mean decrease 1.5 g/dl, 95% CI 0.3-2.7). In contrast, women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) compared to women without Ascaris lumbricoides, particularly among gravidae 2 and 3. These findings suggest that geohelminth infections are common among pregnant women in rural western Kenya, but with few observed detrimental effects. However, routine provision of antihelminth treatment during antenatal clinic visits is recommended, and further evaluation of the impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcomes is warranted.

    **Title:** Mycolactone Suppresses Inflammatory Responses of Nervous Cell Subsets Involved in Pain Perception and Transmission

    **Research Question:** Does mycolactone, a macrolide produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, suppress the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance?

    **Methods:** We investigated the cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of mycolactone on sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia isolated from mice using ex vivo assays. We also tested the effects of mycolactone on neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain in vivo using a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve.

    **Main Findings:** Mycolactone induced significant cell death in all cell types studied at concentrations >10 ng/ml after prolonged exposure (>48h). However, nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators without affecting cell viability within the first 24h of treatment. Notably, mycolactone prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia. In vivo, mycolactone injected daily for 3 days in the spinal canal decreased significantly the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity.

    **Implications:** Our study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia without affecting cell viability. This suggests that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may, at least partially, be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings support the hypothesis that mycolactone-mediated Sec61 blockade in immune cells contributes to analgesia by suppressing inflammation. The suppression of pro-inflammatory mediator production by mycolactone may limit the development of neuroinflammation associated with neuropathic pain in vivo. These results have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for chronic pain management.
Title: Investigating Host Genetic Determinants of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) Outcome in Guinea: A Genome-Wide Association Study

    Abstract:
    Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a lethal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, exhibits a range of clinical outcomes in its human host in West Africa. To elucidate the role of host genetic determinants in modulating HAT outcome, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea. We genotyped 425 individuals, comprising 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls, for 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight candidate genes. Our results show that IL6 rs1818879 allele A is associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.39, CI95 = [0.24-0.63], BONF = 0.0034). In contrast, MIF rs36086171 allele G and MIF rs12483859 C allele are associated with an increased risk of latent infections (p = 0.0239, OR = 1.65, CI95 = [1.07-2.53], BONF = 0.6697 and p = 0.0077, OR = 1.86, CI95 = [1.18-2.95], BONF = 0.2157, respectively). Notably, we confirmed earlier observations that APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) is associated with a higher risk (p = 0.0011, OR = 2.70, CI95 = [1.49-4.91], BONF = 0.0301) and APOL1 G1 polymorphism is associated with a lower risk (p = 0.0005, OR = 0.45, CI95 = [0.29-0.70], BONF = 0.0129) of developing HAT. Our findings suggest that host genes, particularly IL6 rs1818879, play a crucial role in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea. These results enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and may lead to the development of new control tools for HAT.

    Research Question:
    This study aimed to investigate the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and HAT outcome in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea.

    Methods:
    We collected samples from 425 individuals, comprising 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls. We genotyped 28 SNPs in eight candidate genes using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that IL6 rs1818879 allele A is associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease, while MIF rs36086171 allele G and MIF rs12483859 C allele are associated with an increased risk of latent infections. We also confirmed earlier observations that APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) is associated with a higher risk and APOL1 G1 polymorphism is associated with a lower risk of developing HAT.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that host genes, particularly IL6 rs1818879, play a crucial role in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea. These results enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and may lead to the development of new control tools for HAT.

Title: Elucidating the Genetic Structure and Diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore through Deep Whole-Genome Sequencing

    Abstract:
    The genetic landscape of South Asia is characterized by significant intergroup differences in culture and language, resulting in considerable genetic diversity. This study aimed to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore, a population primarily descended from immigrants from Dravidian-language-speaking states in south India. We conducted deep whole-genome sequencing of 38 individuals from the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP) with a target coverage of 30X and compared the results against samples from the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project (SSMP) and populations in Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project (1KGP).

    Our findings reveal that SSIP samples exhibit greater intra-population genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio compared to other Asian populations. Notably, the genetic makeup of SSIP samples is closely related to South Indians, but distinct from Europeans in global population structure analysis with autosomal SNPs. However, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans, indicating higher European admixture than the remaining samples. Furthermore, our analysis of relative relatedness between SSIP and archaic hominins (Denisovan, Neanderthal) identified higher ancient admixture in East Asian populations than in SSIP.

    The results of this study provide valuable insights into the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore and complement the existing resource of South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 1KGP. The publicly available data resource for these samples is expected to serve as a valuable resource for future studies on the genetic diversity of South Asians. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the complex genomic diversity present in the Indian subcontinent and the need for geographically well-distributed samples to yield deeper insights into the migratory history of South Asians.

    In conclusion, this study demonstrates the utility of deep whole-genome sequencing in elucidating the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore. The results of this study provide a foundation for future research on the genetic diversity of South Asians and highlight the importance of considering the complex genomic diversity present in the Indian subcontinent.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Aminoglycoside Susceptibility in Thai Burkholderia pseudomallei Strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a

    Abstract:

    Background: Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, exhibits intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to the expression of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump. However, a small subset of clinical isolates, including Thai strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a, exhibit aminoglycoside susceptibility.

    Research Question: What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the aminoglycoside susceptibility exhibited by Thai Burkholderia pseudomallei strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a?

    Methods: We employed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate the expression levels of amrB transcripts in strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a. Serial passage of strains 2188a and 3799a on increasing gentamicin concentrations yielded mutants that exhibited simultaneous resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides. Transcript analysis revealed upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression in these mutants. We used a PCR walking strategy to identify the amrAB-oprA operon in strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a and found that it was missing in 708a. Rescue of the amrAB-oprB region from a 708a fosmid library and sequencing revealed a large chromosome 1 deletion (131 kb and 141 kb compared to strains K96243 and 1710b, respectively).

    Main Findings: qRT-PCR revealed the absence of amrB transcripts in 708a and greatly reduced levels in 2188a and 3799a. Serial passage of 2188a and 3799a on increasing gentamicin concentrations yielded mutants that became simultaneously resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides. Transcript analysis showed that the resistance of the 2188a and 3799a mutants was due to upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression. The amrAB-oprA operon was found to be missing in 708a, associated with a deletion of more than 70 kb of genetic material. Rescue of the amrAB-oprB region from a 708a fosmid library and sequencing revealed a large chromosome 1 deletion (131 kb and 141 kb compared to strains K96243 and 1710b, respectively).

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the absence of the amrAB-oprA operon in strain 708a is associated with aminoglycoside susceptibility. The upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression in strains 2188a and 3799a is responsible for their resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides. The large chromosome 1 deletion in strain 708a not only removed the amrAB-oprA operon but also the entire gene clusters for malleobactin and cobalamin synthesis, as well as the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway, putative type 1 fimbriae, and secreted chitinase.

    Conclusions: Strain 708a may be a natural candidate for genetic manipulation experiments that use Select Agent compliant antibiotics for selection and validates the use of laboratory-constructed Δ(amrAB-oprA) mutants in such experiments. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of aminoglycoside susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudomallei and highlight the importance of understanding the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in this pathogen.
Title: Unveiling the Interplay between Extracellular Cytokines and Intracellular Transcription Factors in CD4 T Helper Cell Differentiation

    Abstract:
    During the early stages of eukaryotic development, the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors drives the differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells, often mediated by extracellular signaling molecules such as cytokines. We investigated the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper (Th) cells into Th1 versus Th2 states by analyzing single-cell transcriptomics and immunofluorescence data. Contrary to the expected mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, we observed their ubiquitous co-expression in individual cells at high levels, distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming. Furthermore, cytokine expression was found to be cell-to-cell variable, independent of transcription factor expression, and significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, we observed the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, revealing a weak intracellular network overruled by strong extracellular cytokine signals. Our results suggest that CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state during early differentiation, instructed by extracellular cytokines. This interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.

    Methods:
    We studied the spontaneous differentiation of naive CD4 T cells in the absence of exogenously added cytokines, using single-cell transcriptomics and immunofluorescence to analyze gene regulation during the early stage of cell differentiation.

    Main Findings:
    We observed the co-expression of antagonistic transcription factors Tbet and Gata3 in individual cells at high levels, distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming. Cytokine expression was found to be cell-to-cell variable, independent of transcription factor expression, and significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, we observed the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state during early differentiation, instructed by extracellular cytokines. This interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.

    Conclusions:
    Our study reveals a complex interplay between extracellular cytokines and intracellular transcription factors during the early stages of CD4 T helper cell differentiation. The co-expression of antagonistic transcription factors and cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression suggest that CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state during early differentiation, which may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.

    **Title:** PAQR-2 Regulates Cold Adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans through a Novel Pathway Involving Phosphatidylcholine Synthesis and Fatty Acid Desaturation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of PAQR-2 in regulating cold adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans, and how does it interact with phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid desaturation to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures?

    **Methods:** We screened for novel PAQR-2 suppressors in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis (cept-1, pcyt-1, and sams-1) and fatty acid metabolism (ech-7, hacd-1, mdt-15, nhr-49, and sbp-1). We then examined the genetic interactions between PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1, and Δ9-desaturases to understand their role in cold adaptation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1, and Δ9-desaturases form a regulatory pathway that controls the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. The PAQR-2 suppressors normalized the levels of saturated fatty acids, and low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity rescued the PAQR-2 mutant.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that PAQR-2 plays a crucial role in regulating cold adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans by modulating phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid desaturation. This pathway is essential for maintaining membrane fluidity at low temperatures, and its dysregulation can lead to abnormal fatty acid composition and lipid droplet accumulation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides genetic evidence for a novel regulatory axis connecting PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and fatty acid desaturation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We propose that PAQR-2-dependent increases in fatty acid unsaturation are an essential component of cold adaptation in this organism. Our findings have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation and the regulation of membrane fluidity in other organisms.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Hidden Machinery: Electron Cryo-Tomography Reveals a Novel Feature at the Portal Vertex of Human Herpes Simplex Type-1 Virions

    **Research Question:** What is the structural organization of the genome packaging and release machinery in human herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions, and how does it compare to that of tailed bacteriophages?

    **Methods:** We employed electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the ultrastructure of HSV-1 virions and investigate the organization of the portal vertex, a region critical for genome release and virion architecture.

    **Main Findings:** Our cryo-ET analysis revealed a previously unsuspected feature at the portal vertex of HSV-1 virions, which extends across the tegument layer to form a connection between the capsid and the viral membrane. This feature, analogous to the tail apparatus of tailed bacteriophages, suggests a role in genome release into the nucleus and virion architecture.

    **Implications:** The discovery of this novel feature at the portal vertex of HSV-1 virions has significant implications for our understanding of herpesvirus biology. The structural similarity between HSV-1 and tailed bacteriophages implies that equivalent machinery may be present in herpesviruses, facilitating interactions between the portal vertex and cellular components during key stages of the viral life cycle.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the structural organization of HSV-1 virions and highlight the importance of the portal vertex in genome release and virion architecture. The discovery of this novel feature has significant implications for our understanding of herpesvirus biology and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat herpesvirus infections, which cause a range of diseases from cold sores and chicken pox to congenital defects, blindness, and cancer. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional significance of this feature and its role in the herpesvirus life cycle.

    Title: Soluble Egg Antigen from Schistosoma mansoni Modulates HIV-1 Infection and Cytokine/Chemokine Production in Vitro

    Research Question: Can soluble egg antigen (SEA) from Schistosoma mansoni modulate HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    Methods: We investigated the effects of SEA on HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro using a co-culture system of dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cells. DCs were exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2, Th1, or Th1/Th2 (Tmix) promoting conditions, and then co-cultured with naïve T-cells.

    Main Findings: We found that SEA, specifically through kappa-5, potently binds to DC-SIGN and blocks DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 trans-infection (p < 0.05). Moreover, DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2 promoting conditions induced T-cell populations that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection (p < 0.05) compared to DCs unexposed to SEA. This effect was not observed for DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th1 or Tmix promoting conditions. We also observed a reduced capacity of T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DCs to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that SEA from Schistosoma mansoni can modulate HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro, and that this modulation is associated with a reduced susceptibility of T-cells to HIV-1 R5 infection. These results have implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between helminthic parasites and HIV-1, and may provide new insights into the development of strategies to modulate immune responses beneficial for limiting viral transmission or reducing viral loads.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that SEA from Schistosoma mansoni can modulate HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro, and that this modulation is associated with a reduced susceptibility of T-cells to HIV-1 R5 infection. These findings suggest that helminthic infections may be beneficial in the context of HIV-1 infection, and highlight the potential of deciphering the mechanisms underlying these interactions to develop new strategies for modulating immune responses beneficial for limiting viral transmission or reducing viral loads.

    **Title:** A Dynamic Model of Neuronal Stimulation-Induced Extracellular Space Shrinkage in Grey and White Matter

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying the ∼30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter following neuronal stimulation?

    **Methods:** We developed a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to ECS shrinkage in wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model incorporates various membrane processes, including neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane.

    **Main Findings:** Our model suggests that the combination of neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane are sufficient to generate ECS shrinkage. However, when considering ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/K+/Cl− (NKCC1) and the Na+/HCO3− (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage.

    **Implications:** Our model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying ECS shrinkage, which is essential for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function. The model also highlights the importance of measuring ECS shrinkage, membrane potential, and ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations in wild-type and gene knockout individuals, as well as obtaining data on neuronal water, sodium, and chloride uptake during activation.

    **Conclusions:** Our dynamic model provides a detailed and constrained framework that can guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia–neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying ECS shrinkage, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between neurons and astrocytes, which is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of siRNA-Mediated Transcriptional Gene Silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana: A Role for SPT5L/KTF1 in Chromatin Modification

    Abstract:
    Transposons and repetitive DNA elements are abundant in eukaryotic genomes, posing a threat to genome stability if transcribed. In Arabidopsis thaliana, these elements are silenced by the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway, which involves the coordinated action of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), and chromatin-modifying enzymes. However, the mechanism by which chromatin-modifying enzymes are recruited to chromatin remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of SPT5L/KTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT5 elongation factors, in the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we show that SPT5L/KTF1 binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing, downstream of RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) but independently of 24-nt siRNA. We also demonstrate that SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other, and that their binding is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci. Our results suggest that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for the direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Furthermore, we show that SPT5L contributes to the regulation of siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing in a locus-specific manner, enhancing AGO4 chromatin binding without being required for its recruitment. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing and highlight the importance of SPT5L/KTF1 in this process.

    **Title:** RpoS-dependent gene expression is crucial for the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi by feeding nymphs

    **Research Question:** What is the role of RpoS-dependent gene expression in the tick-phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi enzootic cycle, particularly in the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes by feeding nymphs?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and in vitro experiments, to investigate the expression of RpoS-dependent genes in Borrelia burgdorferi during the tick-phase of the enzootic cycle.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. RpoS-deficient organisms are confined to the midgut lumen, where they transform into an unusual morphotype, referred to as round bodies, during the later stages of the blood meal. We show that round body formation is rapidly reversible and appears to be attributable, in part, to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which provides NAD+ for glycolysis. Furthermore, our data suggest that spirochetes default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation when the energetics for transmission are unfavorable.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of RpoS-dependent gene expression in the tick-phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi enzootic cycle, particularly in the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes by feeding nymphs. The discovery of a default survival mode, characterized by round body formation, reveals a previously unsuspected role for RpoSBb in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that RpoS-dependent gene expression is crucial for the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi by feeding nymphs, and that RpoS-deficient organisms default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation when the energetics for transmission are unfavorable. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the tick-phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi enzootic cycle and highlight the importance of RpoS-dependent gene expression in the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes.

    **Title:** Hierarchical Regulation of Stamen Development by Gibberellin and Jasmonate Signaling Pathways in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** How do gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) signaling pathways interact to regulate stamen development in Arabidopsis?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches to investigate the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development. We analyzed the expression of GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes, MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, in GA-deficient and JA-deficient mutants. We also examined the effects of exogenous GA and JA application on stamen development in these mutants.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 are GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes. Loss-of-function of two DELLAs, RGA and RGL2, restores the expression of these three MYB genes together with restoration of stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis revealed that the myb21-t1 myb24-t1 myb57-t1 triple mutant confers a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. Furthermore, we found that GA suppresses DELLAs to mobilize the expression of the key JA biosynthesis gene DAD1, leading to increased JA content in young flower buds.

    **Implications:** Our study establishes a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in regulating stamen development. GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, which are essential for stamen filament elongation and pollen maturation. This interaction between GA and JA signaling pathways is crucial for normal stamen development in Arabidopsis.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between GA and JA signaling pathways in regulating stamen development. We propose that modulation of the JA pathway by GA is one of the prerequisites for GA to regulate normal stamen development in Arabidopsis. This study highlights the importance of understanding the cross-talk between different hormone signaling pathways in plant development.
Title: **Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) Modulates Lifespan Extension by Dietary Restriction in Caenorhabditis elegans through the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway**

    Abstract:

    **Background:** Dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to extend lifespan in various species and slow the onset of age-related diseases. The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway has been implicated in longevity phenotypes resulting from DR. However, the downstream targets of this pathway that modulate lifespan remain unclear.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in modulating lifespan extension by DR in Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We used a modified DR method based on variation of bacterial food concentrations on solid agar plates to investigate the role of HIF-1 in lifespan extension by DR in C. elegans. We also used genetic epistasis experiments to determine the relationship between HIF-1 and the nutrient-responsive TOR-S6K pathway.

    **Main Findings:** We found that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner, and its loss-of-function mutant extends lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fails to show lifespan extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR. This deficiency is rescued by tissue-specific expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. We also show that HIF-1 acts downstream of the nutrient-responsive TOR-S6K pathway to determine lifespan in C. elegans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel role for HIF-1 in modulating lifespan extension by DR in C. elegans through the IRE-1 ER stress pathway. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DR-mediated lifespan extension and highlight the importance of HIF-1 as a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.

    **Title:** Transcription Factor GRHL3 Regulates Divergent Gene Expression Programs in Differentiating and Migrating Keratinocytes through Chromatin Rearrangements

    **Research Question:** How does the transcription factor GRHL3 regulate distinct gene expression programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes, and what role do chromatin rearrangements play in this process?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and gene expression analysis to investigate the role of GRHL3 in regulating gene expression in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that GRHL3 binds preferentially to super-enhancers (SEs) in differentiating keratinocytes, while in migrating keratinocytes, it binds preferentially to promoters along with the transcriptional repressor REST, repressing the expression of migration inhibitors. We also found that GRHL3 regulates the formation of enhancers, including the suppression of non-keratinocyte SEs in differentiating keratinocytes. Furthermore, GRHL3 is essential for normal keratinocyte migration during eyelid closure and wound healing, where it modulates gene expression programs that promote the movement of keratinocytes and suppress the progenitor and differentiation states.

    **Implications:** These findings provide mechanistic insight into how a single transcription factor can control distinct gene expression programs under different physiological states within the same cell type. Our data highlight the reciprocal regulatory relationship between GRHL3 and chromatin domains, including SEs, which applies not only to cell type specifications but also to migration, a reversible cell state.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that GRHL3 regulates divergent gene expression programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes through chromatin rearrangements, including the formation and suppression of super-enhancers. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how transcription factors regulate cell fate decisions and highlight the complex interplay between GRHL3 and chromatin domains in regulating gene expression in keratinocytes.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Antagonism between Endogenous and Exogenous Retroviruses in Sheep: Evidence for Host Defense Mechanisms

    **Background:** Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have integrated into the host germline and are transmitted vertically from generation to generation. It is hypothesized that some ERVs act as restriction factors to block the infection of pathogenic retroviruses.

    **Research Question:** Do ERVs play a role in the coevolution of endogenous and exogenous retroviruses and their hosts?

    **Methods:** We isolated and characterized the evolutionary history and molecular virology of 27 enJSRV proviruses in sheep, a model system for studying retrovirus-host coevolution.

    **Main Findings:** We identified two enJSRV proviruses (enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20) that acquired a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype able to block late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication (∼9,000 years ago). Interestingly, a provirus escaping the transdominant enJSRVs has emerged very recently, most likely within the last 200 years.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections. The transdominant proviruses may have been selected to defend the host against related ERVs already colonizing the host genome rather than against pathogenic exogenous retroviruses.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for an evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses in sheep, indicating that ERVs have been used by the host to fight exogenous pathogenic retroviral infections. The continuous emergence of new proviruses, such as enJSRV-26, suggests that this antagonism is an ongoing process that has not reached equilibrium. Our findings have implications for understanding the complex interplay between retroviruses and their hosts and highlight the importance of ERVs as restriction factors in host defense mechanisms.

    **Title:** Evaluation of In-House Real-Time Schistosoma PCRs for the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Schistosomiasis

    **Research Question:** Can in-house real-time Schistosoma PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium be used to diagnose active infections and monitor treatment efficacy in patients with suspected schistosomiasis?

    **Methods:** This study evaluated the performance of two in-house real-time Schistosoma PCRs on 412 samples (124 urine, 86 stools, 8 biopsies, and 194 sera) from patients with suspected schistosomiasis. The samples were compared to microscopic examination and serological assays (ELISA, HA, and WB) as reference methods.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed that Schistosoma PCRs significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis compared to microscopy, from 4% to 10.5% and from 33.7% to 48.8% for S. haematobium in urine and S. mansoni in stools, respectively. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum samples was 72.7% and reached 94.1% in patients with positive excreta (microscopy). The specificity of serum PCR was 98.9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% at day 360, whereas antibody detection remained positive after 1 year.

    **Implications:** The study suggests that Schistosoma PCRs outperform standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods combined with WB-based serology, which remains a gold standard for initial diagnosis. When serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative, serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration. Biomarkers such as DNA and antibodies are of limited relevance for early treatment monitoring, but serum PCR could be useful when performed at least 1 year after treatment to help confirm a cured infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of in-house real-time Schistosoma PCRs as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of schistosomiasis. The high sensitivity and specificity of serum PCRs make them a useful adjunct to standard diagnostic methods, particularly in cases where serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative.

    **Title:** Machine Learning Accelerates Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Complex Molecules: A Case Study on Archazolid A

    **Research Question:** Can machine learning (ML) be used to estimate potential energy surfaces and accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of structurally complex molecules, such as Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase?

    **Methods:** We employed Gaussian process regression, a Bayesian non-parametric ML method, to model the relationship between molecular structure and quantum mechanical (QM) properties of Archazolid A. We used a simple molecular representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances to encode conformations, which were then used to train ML models. Semi-empirical MD simulations were carried out using the VAMP program with the AM1 Hamiltonian, and the starting structure of Archazolid A was modeled using NMR constraints.

    **Main Findings:** Our ML models achieved mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional level of theory (DFT/BLYP-disp3/def2-TZVP). We demonstrated that predictive variance can be used to assess whether a conformation is in the interpolation region, allowing a controlled trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed-up.

    **Implications:** This study shows that ML can be used to develop predictive models for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures. Our approach can be applied to other challenging chemical and biomolecular systems, providing access to long-term simulations.

    **Conclusions:** We successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using ML to estimate potential energy surfaces and accelerate MD simulations of complex molecules, such as Archazolid A. Our results highlight the potential of ML to revolutionize the field of molecular simulations, enabling the study of complex systems that were previously inaccessible due to computational limitations. This study paves the way for the development of innovative ML algorithms tightly integrated with MD techniques, which can provide new insights into chemical and biomolecular systems.

    **Title:** Non-Invasive Detection of Ebolavirus Antibodies in Wild Great Apes: Implications for Conservation and Public Health

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a non-invasive method to detect ebolavirus antibodies in wild great apes, and what are the implications for conservation and public health?

    **Methods:** We developed a non-invasive immunological assay to detect ebolavirus antibodies in great ape feces. We collected fecal samples from wild great apes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DCO) and used immunoblotting to detect nucleoprotein (NP) antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV).

    **Main Findings:** We successfully detected ebolavirus antibodies in 10% of fecal samples from wild gorillas in the DCO region, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Notably, evidence of antibodies was also identified in gorillas thought to be unexposed to EBOV, suggesting that they may have been protected from exposure by topological barriers of transmission.

    **Implications:** Our non-invasive method for detecting ebolavirus antibodies in wild great ape feces has significant implications for conservation and public health. It allows for early detection of increased incidence of exposure, identification of immunologically naïve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and tracking of vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Moreover, since human Ebola virus disease (EVD) is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EVD causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%.

    **Conclusions:** This study represents the first time that ebolavirus antibodies have been detected in wild great ape fecal samples, and our non-invasive method has the potential to revolutionize the management and survival of these primates. Our findings support the development of prospective epidemiological ebolavirus studies in wild great ape populations and highlight the importance of conservation efforts to protect these species from future EVD infections.

    **Title:** XopL, a Novel Type III Effector from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, Exhibits E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Activity and Subverts Plant Immunity

    **Research Question:** How does the novel type III effector XopL from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria manipulate plant cell processes and subvert plant immunity?

    **Methods:** We employed in vitro and in planta assays to investigate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of XopL, a type III effector from the model plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. We also determined the crystal structures of the XopL C-terminal and N-terminal regions to elucidate the molecular basis of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that XopL exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta, inducing plant cell death and subverting plant immunity. The E3 ligase activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL, which specifically interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates the formation of predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, which is not present in any previously characterized E3 ligase. Mutation of amino acids in the central cavity of the XL-box disrupts E3 ligase activity and prevents XopL-induced plant cell death.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the unique structural fold of the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain within the Xanthomonas XopL, which is unprecedented and underscores the variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking this eukaryote-specific activity. This suggests that during co-evolution with their hosts, pathogenic bacteria have employed different solutions to fulfill the otherwise typical eukaryote-specific function of E3 ubiquitin ligases.

    **Conclusions:** Characterization of the bacterial pathogen effector XopL uncovered a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase fold that is part of the pathogen repertoire to mimic an otherwise strictly eukaryotic function such as ubiquitination. This underlines the variety of E3 ligases evolved in pathogenic bacteria for subverting host biology and highlights the complexity of plant-pathogen interactions.

    **Title:** Impaired T Follicular Helper Cell Function in Acute HIV Infection and the Impact of Early Antiretroviral Treatment

    **Research Question:** What is the role of T follicular helper cells (cTfh) in acute HIV infection, and how does early antiretroviral treatment (ART) affect cTfh function and B cell responses?

    **Methods:** This study utilized the RV254 cohort of HIV-infected individuals in stages 1/2 (early acute infection) and stage 3 (late acute infection) to investigate cTfh function and B cell responses. Circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh) were examined, and cTfh and memory B cell populations were phenotyped.

    **Main Findings:** Impaired cTfh cell function was observed in individuals treated in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. cTfh/B cell cocultures showed lower B cell survival and IgG secretion in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with lower IL-10 and increased RANTES and TNF-α, suggesting a role for inflammation in altering cTfh and B cell responses. Elevated plasma viral load in stage 3 was found to correlate with decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, indicating a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment and dysfunctional humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were also evident in the mature B cell compartment, with a decrease in resting memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with higher viremia.

    **Implications:** These data suggest that cTfh-mediated B cell responses are significantly altered in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased inflammation and a reduction in memory B cells. Early ART for acutely HIV-infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation while preserving cTfh function and B cell memory.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of early ART in preserving cTfh function and B cell responses in acute HIV infection. The findings suggest that cTfh cells are impaired in their ability to provide B cell help as early as stage 3 of acute HIV infection, and that identifying individuals very early on during HIV infection has the potential to preserve cTfh-dependent B cell responses. These results have significant implications for the development of strategies to prevent immune dysregulation and preserve humoral immunity in HIV-infected individuals.

    **Title:** Pharmacological Profiling of Schistosome Serotonergic GPCR (Sm. 5HTR) as a Target for Next-Generation Anthelmintics

    **Background:** Schistosomiasis, a tropical parasitic disease, affects approximately 200 million people worldwide. Current therapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, which has several suboptimal features. Therefore, there is an urgent need for next-generation anthelmintics. However, the process of validating physiologically relevant targets and pharmacologically profiling them is challenging.

    **Research Question:** Can we pharmacologically profile a schistosome serotonergic GPCR (Sm. 5HTR) implicated as a downstream modulator of PZQ efficacy and identify new ligands with potency and selectivity for Sm. 5HTR over its human homolog (Hs. 5HTR7)?

    **Methods:** We employed a miniaturized screening assay compatible with high-content screening, utilizing a split luciferase-based biosensor sensitive to cellular cAMP levels to resolve the proximal kinetics of GPCR modulation in intact cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our data demonstrate a divergent pharmacological signature between Sm. 5HTR and Hs. 5HTR7, supporting the feasibility of optimizing parasitic-selective pharmacophores. We identified new ligands and chemical series with potency and selectivity for Sm. 5HTR over Hs. 5HTR7 in vitro and validated them for in vivo efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms. Notably, Sm. 5HTR displayed a property resembling irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon also observed at Hs. 5HTR7.

    **Implications:** These findings underscore the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in a high-throughput screening format and highlight the promise of Sm. 5HTR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for the development of next-generation anthelmintics.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of Sm. 5HTR as a target for anthelmintic ligand design, despite the divergence in pharmacological selectivity between the human and schistosome 5-HT GPCRs. The conservation of an unusual antagonist-evoked inactivation mechanism at Sm. 5HTR enhances its appeal as a target for anthelmintic development. Our results provide a foundation for the rational design and development of antiparasitic drugs aimed at schistosomal GPCRs.

    **Title:** EphrinB/EphB Signaling Regulates Cell Detachment and Tissue Separation at the Ectoderm-Mesoderm Boundary during Gastrulation

    **Research Question:** How do ectoderm and mesoderm cells maintain their integrity and separate during gastrulation, a critical process in the development of multicellular organisms?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of ephrinB/EphB signaling in regulating cell detachment and tissue separation at the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary during gastrulation in various organisms, including Drosophila, zebrafish, and amphibians.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that localized detachment of cells at the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary is crucial for tissue separation, and this process is mediated by ephrinB/EphB signaling. We found that multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, and tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and RhoA. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation, instead involving localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle that allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ephrinB/EphB signaling plays a critical role in regulating cell detachment and tissue separation at the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary during gastrulation, and that this process is essential for the proper formation of germ layers in multicellular organisms.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of tissue separation during gastrulation and highlights the importance of ephrinB/EphB signaling in regulating cell detachment and tissue separation at the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary. These findings have implications for our understanding of the development of multicellular organisms and may shed light on the evolution of gastrulation mechanisms across different species. Further studies are needed to explore the conservation of this mechanism in other organisms, such as zebrafish and Drosophila, and to investigate the role of RhoA and Rac in the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary during gastrulation.

    Title: Multivariate Analysis of Folate-Dependent One-Carbon Metabolism and Transulfuration Pathways Reveals Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorders

    Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have experienced a significant increase in diagnosed cases over the past four decades, yet the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Current diagnoses rely heavily on behavioral observations and psychometric tools, limiting the accuracy and timeliness of diagnoses. To address this knowledge gap, this study aimed to investigate the potential of biochemical data to support ASD diagnoses.

    Methods: Blood samples from 83 participants with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers were analyzed for metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transulfuration (TS) pathways. Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) and Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) were employed to classify participants as ASD or neurotypical and predict adaptive behavior, respectively.

    Main Findings: The multivariate analysis revealed that 96.1% of neurotypical participants were correctly identified as such, while 97.6% of the ASD cohort was accurately classified. Furthermore, KPLS predicted adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. Notably, measurement of five metabolites was sufficient to achieve this level of accuracy.

    Implications: This study demonstrates the potential of biochemical data to support ASD diagnoses, offering a promising avenue for earlier and more accurate diagnoses. The findings suggest that the metabolites under investigation are strongly correlated with an ASD diagnosis, and the statistical analysis used here provides a powerful tool for extracting valuable information from complex biochemical data sets.

    Conclusions: The results of this study provide unprecedented quantitative classification results for separating participants into ASD and neurotypical cohorts based solely on biochemical data. The use of multivariate statistical analysis, such as FDA and KPLS, enables the extraction of important information from complex biochemical data sets, far exceeding the accuracy of previous approaches in this field. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel diagnostic tools and biomarkers for ASD, ultimately improving the lives of individuals with ASD and their families.
Title: Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Leishmaniasis Incidence in Brazil: A Bayesian Geostatistical Approach

    Abstract:
    Leishmaniasis is a significant public health concern in Brazil, with an estimated 350 million people at risk and 2 million cases annually. This study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil over a 10-year period (2001-2010) using Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models. We employed integrated nested Laplace approximations to perform fast approximate Bayesian inference and Bayesian variable selection to identify the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of the diseases.

    Our results showed that precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were significant risk factors for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (SD: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. Spatially explicit, high-resolution incidence maps identified priority areas where leishmaniasis control efforts should be targeted, with the highest numbers of infected people predicted in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively.

    This study contributes to the understanding of the determinants of leishmaniasis in Brazil by providing countrywide, model-based incidence maps for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis at a high spatial resolution (88 km). Our findings highlight the importance of considering precipitation and socioeconomic factors in leishmaniasis control efforts. The results of this study can inform targeted interventions to reduce disease incidence and ultimately improve public health outcomes in Brazil.

    Title: Age-Related Spectrum of Dengue Disease: A Comparative Analysis of Clinical and Laboratory Features in Adults and Children

    Research Question: What are the differences in clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcomes of dengue disease in adults and children, and how do these differences relate to age-related physiological norms?

    Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of 1528 hospitalized dengue cases, comprising 647 adults and 881 children, admitted to a single hospital in southern Vietnam. Detailed clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between the two age groups.

    Main Findings: Our study revealed significant differences in the clinical and laboratory features of dengue disease between adults and children. Signs of vascular leakage and shock were more frequent and severe in children, while bleeding manifestations and organ involvement were more common in adults. Adults also experienced significantly more severe thrombocytopenia. Secondary infection, but not serotype, was independently associated with greater thrombocytopenia, although with a smaller effect than age-group. Notably, healthy adults had intrinsically lower platelet counts compared to children, even several weeks after recovery.

    Implications: Our findings highlight the importance of considering age-related physiological differences in the management and treatment of dengue disease. The observed differences in clinical and laboratory features between adults and children have significant implications for disease pathogenesis research and the development of management guidelines tailored to the age-groups at risk.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the complications experienced by adults and children with dengue disease tend to reflect age-related physiological norms. The findings underscore the need for formal research studies to inform the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions, which are becoming increasingly routine in some dengue-endemic countries without evidence of benefit. Furthermore, the lack of practical guidelines on the use of blood products in adults with dengue necessitates further investigation. Our study provides valuable insights into the age-related spectrum of dengue disease, which will inform the development of more effective management strategies and improve patient outcomes.

    **Title:** SIVsmm Infection in Sooty Mangabeys Reveals CCR5-Independent Entry Pathways

    **Research Question:** What is the role of CCR5 in SIVsmm infection in sooty mangabeys, and do alternative entry pathways contribute to the non-pathogenic nature of SIVsmm infection in these natural hosts?

    **Methods:** We investigated the prevalence of CCR5 mutations and their impact on SIVsmm infection in a large sooty mangabey colony. We identified a novel CCR5 allele containing a two-base pair deletion (Δ2) that encodes a truncated molecule not expressed on the cell surface and unable to support SIV entry in vitro. We analyzed the expression of CCR5 on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells across genotype groups and assessed the prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection in animals lacking functional CCR5.

    **Main Findings:** We found that 8% of sooty mangabeys were homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles, and 41% were heterozygous. Despite their CCR5-null status, homozygous mutant animals were susceptible to natural and experimental SIVsmm infection and displayed viral loads only modestly lower than CCR5 wild-type animals. SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type PBMC in a CCR5-independent manner in vitro. Envs from both CCR5-null and wild-type infected animals used CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1 in addition to CCR5 in transfected cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in sooty mangabeys, which may enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of restricted CCR5 expression. This raises the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that SIVsmm infection in sooty mangabeys is characterized by CCR5-independent entry pathways, which may contribute to the non-pathogenic nature of SIVsmm infection in these natural hosts. These findings have important implications for our understanding of SIVsmm tropism and host cell targeting in vivo and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 infection.
Title: Elucidating the Dual Role of MEF2 in Tumorigenesis: Implications for Therapeutic Intervention in Leiomyosarcomas

    Abstract:
    The transcription factor MEF2 (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2) has been implicated in both oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the contribution of MEF2 to the tumorigenic process in leiomyosarcomas (LMS), a rare and aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma. Our results reveal that MEF2 can exhibit both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities depending on its interaction with co-activators or co-repressors, such as class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). We demonstrate that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are overexpressed in 22% of LMS cases, where high levels of MEF2, HDAC4, and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. Knockout of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells by restoring the transcriptional proficiency of MEF2-target loci. Furthermore, we show that class IIa HDACs do not bind all regulatory elements bound by MEF2, allowing for the coexistence of actively transcribed and strongly repressed MEF2-target genes. Our findings suggest that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are potential druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in LMS.

    Methods:
    We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of MEF2 in LMS. We analyzed the expression levels of MEF2 and class IIa HDACs in LMS tissues and cell lines. We also performed knockdown and knockout experiments to assess the impact of MEF2 and HDAC9 on the transformed phenotype of LMS cells.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that MEF2 can exhibit both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities depending on its interaction with co-activators or co-repressors. We found that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are overexpressed in 22% of LMS cases, where high levels of MEF2, HDAC4, and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. Knockout of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells by restoring the transcriptional proficiency of MEF2-target loci.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for LMS. The identification of class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, as potential druggable targets provides a new avenue for the treatment of this aggressive type of cancer.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study elucidates the dual role of MEF2 in tumorigenesis and highlights the importance of class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, in the development and progression of LMS. Our results suggest that targeting class IIa HDACs may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of LMS.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Surface Structure of Hydrophobin Films: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study

    **Research Question:** What is the surface structure of hydrophobin films composed of class II hydrophobins HFBI and HFBII produced by Trichoderma reesei, and how do these structures contribute to the unique properties of hydrophobin films?

    **Methods:** We employed a multi-disciplinary approach combining protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy to investigate the surface structure of hydrophobin films. High-resolution structures of HFBI and HFBII were used as input for protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Cryo-EM measurements were used to determine the experimental unit cell size and symmetry of the 2-D crystal structure of the hydrophobins.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins, with computational results indicating P6 symmetry and experimental results showing P3 symmetry with a unit cell size of 56 Å. However, our computational results also suggest the possibility of an alternate ordering with a three-protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size. We used a Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydrophobin film to demonstrate how this alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films.

    **Implications:** The unique properties of hydrophobin films arise from cooperative effects in the stabilization of the film resulting from interactions between interlocking proteins in the structured surface network. Our findings have implications for both biology and nanotechnology, as the interfacial assemblies of hydrophobins have led to numerous industrial applications.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a detailed atomic-resolution picture of the assembled structure of hydrophobin films at the air-water interface. The alternate metastable structure with P3 symmetry may play a crucial role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films, indicating a mechanism of general significance to both biology and nanotechnology. Our results highlight the importance of cooperative effects in the stabilization of hydrophobin films and provide new insights into the self-assembly of these proteins at interfaces.
Title: Functional Characterization of Threonyl tRNA Synthetase (LdThrRS) from Leishmania donovani: A Potential Target for Antileishmanial Drug Discovery

    Abstract:
    Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis, relies on threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) for protein synthesis. We investigated the functional characterization of LdThrRS and its potential as a target for antileishmanial drug discovery. Recombinant LdThrRS (rLdThrRS) was expressed in E. coli, purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that LdThrRS is localized to both the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS in Leishmania promastigotes exhibited a restrictive growth phenotype, attenuated infectivity, and increased susceptibility to the ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. The in silico-generated structural model of LdThrRS showed considerable similarity to human ThrRS. Borrelidin displayed a strong affinity for LdThrRS (Kd: 0.04 μM) and effectively inhibited the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS (IC50: 0.06 μM) and promastigotes (IC50: 21 μM). Our findings demonstrate that LdThrRS is essential for L. donovani survival and suggest its potential as a target for antileishmanial drug discovery.

    Research Question:
    What is the functional characterization of threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) from Leishmania donovani and its potential as a target for antileishmanial drug discovery?

    Methods:
    Recombinant LdThrRS was expressed in E. coli, purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to determine the subcellular localization of LdThrRS. Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS were generated in Leishmania promastigotes, and their growth, infectivity, aminoacylation activity, and sensitivity to borrelidin were assessed. An in silico-generated structural model of LdThrRS was compared to human ThrRS.

    Main Findings:
    Recombinant LdThrRS displayed aminoacylation activity, and the protein is localized to both the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS exhibited a restrictive growth phenotype, attenuated infectivity, and increased susceptibility to borrelidin. The in silico-generated structural model of LdThrRS showed considerable similarity to human ThrRS. Borrelidin displayed a strong affinity for LdThrRS and effectively inhibited the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS and promastigotes.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that LdThrRS is essential for L. donovani survival and is a potential target for antileishmanial drug discovery. The high affinity of borrelidin for LdThrRS and its effectiveness in inhibiting the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS and promastigotes make it a promising lead compound for further development.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides the first functional characterization of LdThrRS from Leishmania donovani and demonstrates its potential as a target for antileishmanial drug discovery. The essentiality of LdThrRS for L. donovani survival and the high affinity of borrelidin for LdThrRS make it an attractive target for further investigation.
Title: Elucidating the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) Signature for Non-Self Recognition by RIG-I

    Abstract:

    Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection triggers the innate immune response through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viral nucleic acid by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-I. Accurate PAMP discrimination is crucial to avoid self-recognition, which can lead to autoimmunity.

    Research Question: What are the RNA structure-function attributes that impart PAMP function to the poly-U/UC tract of HCV RNA, enabling non-self recognition by RIG-I?

    Methods: We conducted a detailed structure-function analysis of RIG-I and poly-U/UC RNA interactions and innate immune signaling using in vitro and in vivo models.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the 34-nucleotide poly-uridine "core" of the poly-U/UC tract is essential for RIG-I activation, and interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences are required for optimal RIG-I signal induction. We also found that 5'-ppp poly-U/UC RNA variants that stimulated strong RIG-I activation efficiently bound purified RIG-I protein in vitro, and RNA interaction with both the repressor domain and helicase domain of RIG-I was required to activate signaling.

    Implications: Our studies define a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that incorporates a 5'-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide insights into the antiviral therapeutic potential of targeted RIG-I signaling activation and highlight the importance of understanding the virus-host interface regulating innate immunity against HCV. The identification of the HCV PAMP motif offers a basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to restrict HCV infection.
Title: Eosinophils Promote Trichinella spiralis Larval Growth in Skeletal Muscle through an IL-4 Dependent Mechanism

    Abstract:
    The role of eosinophils in host-parasite interactions has expanded beyond their traditional function in host defense and allergy to include metabolism and tissue regeneration. We investigated the mechanism underlying the observation that eosinophils promote growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. Our results indicate that IL-4 and eosinophils are necessary for normal larval growth and that eosinophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. We found that eosinophils suppress local inflammation and influence nutrient homeostasis in muscle, redistributing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phosphorylating Akt in nurse cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose uptake and glycogen storage by larvae. Our data suggest that eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses that otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle. These findings document a novel interaction between parasite and host in which worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate host cell response to facilitate their growth.

    Methods:
    We used a mouse model of Trichinella spiralis infection to investigate the role of eosinophils in larval growth in skeletal muscle. We performed whole genome transcriptional profiling to identify genes altered early in the course of muscle infection, coincident with the interval during which eosinophils are required. We also used Rag1-/- mice to limit the numbers of infiltrating cells in muscle tissue and transferred eosinophils from IL-4 or STAT6-competent mice to ablated mice to investigate the mechanism of eosinophil-mediated larval growth.

    Main Findings:
    Our results indicate that IL-4 and eosinophils are necessary for normal larval growth and that eosinophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. We found that eosinophils suppress local inflammation and influence nutrient homeostasis in muscle, redistributing GLUT4 and phosphorylating Akt in nurse cells. Our data suggest that eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses that otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle.

    Implications:
    These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between parasites and their hosts. They suggest that worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate host cell response to facilitate their growth, and that eosinophils play a critical role in this process. Further experimentation is needed to clarify the mechanism by which eosinophils promote larval growth.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides evidence for a novel interaction between parasite and host in which worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate host cell response to facilitate their growth. Eosinophils play a critical role in this process, promoting larval growth through an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses that otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between parasites and their hosts.

    **Title:** Revisiting the Replication Timing Program of Mammalian Genomes: A Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Replication Kinetics in Human Cells

    **Research Question:** Do mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase-scale domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless transition regions, as previously suggested by genome-wide replication timing studies?

    **Methods:** We performed a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in HeLa cells using DNA combing and multi-scale analysis of replication timing profiles.

    **Main Findings:** Our results contradict the previous view by showing that replication origins in HeLa cells are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase. Replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed through S phase, with a mean velocity of 0.7 kb/min and a maximum velocity of 2.0 kb/min. We also observed a broad distribution of replication timing gradients with no regions larger than 100 kb replicating at less than 2 kb/min, indicating that HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate that increases during S phase, and replication timing gradients are set by the delay and spacing between successive origin firings rather than by the velocity of single forks.

    **Conclusions:** Our study sheds new light on the replication timing program of mammalian genomes and provides a general model for their replication kinetics. We propose that origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure, or that replication forks progressing from early origins stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mammalian genome replication and the regulation of replication timing.

    **Supporting Evidence:** Our results are corroborated by analysis of published origin maps in HeLa cells and published replication timing and DNA combing data in several other cell types, with the exception of embryonic stem cells where regions of unidirectional fork progression seem more abundant.

    Title: Implementing Temporal Stability in the Nervous System: A Biologically Realistic Approach to Invariant Object Recognition

    Research Question: How can the nervous system efficiently recognize objects in spite of changes in contextual variables, such as perspective or lighting conditions, by exploiting the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise?

    Methods: This study investigates the implementation of the "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. We first demonstrate that slow feature analysis (SFA), an algorithm that is based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons by means of a modified Hebbian learning rule. We then show analytically that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window.

    Main Findings: Our analysis reveals that the outcome of STDP learning is not governed by the learning window alone but rather by the convolution of the learning window with the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). We derive STDP learning windows that implement SFA and the "trace rule," which are compatible with physiological data both in shape and timescale. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that STDP can be interpreted as an implementation of the slowness principle, which enables the nervous system to recognize objects in spite of changes in contextual variables. This interpretation is supported by the fact that physiologically plausible parameters lead to a learning window whose shape and width is in agreement with experimental findings.

    Conclusions: This study provides a novel interpretation for the functional role of STDP in physiological neurons and offers a biologically realistic approach to invariant object recognition. Our results indicate that STDP can be used to establish invariant representations in early sensory processing, such as visual receptive fields that become invariant to microsaccades inducing small translations. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying object recognition and perception.

    **Title:** Cooperative Adaptation to Therapy: A Novel Mechanism of Cancer Drug Resistance

    **Research Question:** How do phenotypically diverse cancer cells within a heterogeneous tumor interact with each other to develop resistance to chemotherapy?

    **Methods:** We employed a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to engineer phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by introducing mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. We used a substrate-free NanoCulture system to monitor three-dimensional growth dynamics of fluorescently-labeled mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. We integrated mathematical modeling with flow cytometry to characterize the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors, termed cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. Our results show that the combination of wild-type and mutant cells in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug-sensitive cells despite drug pressure, via induction of cell state transitions described by a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that profiling for druggable targets (i.e., mutations) alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy, as non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells can thwart drug pressure. This new paradigm in drug resistance highlights the importance of understanding how phenotypically distinct cells within the same tumor interact to promote resistance.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of cancer drug resistance, cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells. These findings have significant implications for the development of effective cancer therapies, emphasizing the need to consider the complex interactions between phenotypically diverse cancer cells within a heterogeneous tumor.
Title: Seroprevalence and Risk Factors of Spotted Fever Group Rickettsioses in Mbeya Region, Southwestern Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Study

    Abstract:

    Background: Rickettsioses are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, but the burden of disease, risk factors, and transmission dynamics are poorly understood. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae and identify associated socioeconomic and environmental risk factors in the Mbeya Region, Southwestern Tanzania.

    Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study among 1,228 individuals aged ≥5 years from nine communities in Mbeya Region, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. Serology (indirect immunofluorescence) was performed at a dilution of 1:64.

    Main Findings: The overall seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae was 67.9% (range: 42.8-91.4% among nine sites). Multivariable analysis revealed associations with age (prevalence ratio per 10 years: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06-1.10), warmer temperatures (prevalence ratio per °C: 1.38; 1.11-1.71), male gender (prevalence ratio: 1.08; 1.00-1.16), and low population density (prevalence ratio per 1,000 persons/km² increase: 0.96; 0.94-0.99). At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that SFG rickettsial infection is common in the rural population of Mbeya Region, and its spread is limited by temperature and higher elevation. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses and the determination of the causative pathogens.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the seroprevalence and risk factors of SFG rickettsioses in southwestern Tanzania. The findings are compatible with previous descriptions and add information on risk factors for SFG rickettsioses in the region. Future studies should aim to detect the pathogen in acute infection and describe the local transmission cycle to validate the identified risk factors in a prospective manner.
Title: Oleate, a Monounsaturated Fatty Acid, Plays a Crucial Role in the Innate Immune Response of Caenorhabditis elegans

    Abstract:

    Background: Fatty acids, including monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) like oleate, are essential for various physiological processes. However, their role in the innate immune response remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of oleate in the innate immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans?

    Methods: We conducted an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify regulators of innate immune defense genes in C. elegans. We identified two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases responsible for oleate synthesis and demonstrated that oleate production is necessary for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes.

    Main Findings: Our results show that C. elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation. We also found that oleate affects immune effector expression and pathogen resistance differently than polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like γ-linolenic acid (GLA) and stearidonic acid (SDA).

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of oleate in the innate immune response of C. elegans and suggests an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection.

    Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that oleate plays a crucial role in the innate immune response of C. elegans, distinct from the effects of PUFAs. These results add to the known health-promoting effects of MUFAs and provide new insights into the complex relationship between nutrient metabolism and immune function.

    **Title:** Designing Novel Antimicrobial Compounds Targeting Guanine Riboswitches for Selective Bacterial Killing

    **Background:** Riboswitches are regulatory elements that modulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding. Recent studies have shown that riboswitch agonists may exhibit antimicrobial properties by binding to the riboswitch domain. Guanine riboswitches are involved in the regulation of transport and biosynthesis of purine metabolites, which are critical for the cellular pool of nucleotides.

    **Research Question:** Can we design novel antimicrobial compounds that target guanine riboswitches to selectively kill bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens?

    **Methods:** We used molecular modeling of crystal structures to select pyrimidine compounds that could fit into the guanine riboswitch aptamer binding site. We then tested the bactericidal activity of these compounds against various bacterial species, including clinical strains exhibiting multiple drug resistance.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a pyrimidine compound (PC1) that binds to guanine riboswitches and exhibits bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including well-known nosocomial pathogens. The bactericidal activity of PC1 was only seen against bacteria using a guanine riboswitch to control guaA expression, even when bacteria were grown in a rich medium. We also demonstrated that PC1 targets a different metabolic pathway, as several clinical strains exhibiting multiple drug resistance were inhibited.

    **Implications:** This study establishes the possibility of using existing structural knowledge to design novel guanine riboswitch-targeting antibiotics as powerful and selective antimicrobial compounds. The finding of this new guanine riboswitch target is crucial as community-acquired bacterial infections have recently started to emerge.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the potential of designing novel antimicrobial compounds that target guanine riboswitches to selectively kill bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens. This approach may provide a new avenue for the development of antibiotics that can overcome the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Further studies are needed to fully explore the therapeutic potential of these compounds.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Gaze in Constructing Mental Space during Wayfinding in Primates: A Virtual Reality Study

    Abstract:

    Research Question: How does gaze inform the construction of mental space during wayfinding in primates, and what are the neural mechanisms underlying this process?

    Methods: We investigated navigation behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity in macaque monkeys as they searched a virtual reality maze for a reward. The monkeys' head direction, point of gaze, and task context were recorded and analyzed in conjunction with hippocampal activity.

    Main Findings: We found that hippocampal cells sensitive to place also responded to one or more variables such as head direction, point of gaze, or task context. Many cells fired at the sight (and in anticipation) of a single landmark in a viewpoint- or task-dependent manner, simultaneously encoding the animal's logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Our results indicate that hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and action contexts.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in the construction of space. This conjunctive type of coding appears ubiquitous across mammalians, as our results are consistent with the encoding of task-related demands by hippocampal neurons in rodents.

    Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the variables controlling the activity of hippocampal cells, bridging the gap between studies in rodents and primates, including humans, collected in real and virtual environments. We show that hippocampal cells code for the target of gaze in an informed manner, embedding self-position with respect to elements in the environment and to action context. Our data suggest that the counterpart of place cells in primates, as compared to rodents, is expressed as activity related to point of gaze in conjunction with other variables essential to navigation, such as position and identity of visual elements at key instants of trajectory planning.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Regulatory Network at the Mid-Hindbrain Boundary: A Boolean Analysis of Spatial Gene Expression Patterns

    **Research Question:** How do transcription and secreted factors interact to establish and maintain the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) during vertebrate development?

    **Methods:** We employed a Boolean analysis of spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB to identify key regulatory interactions in the network. We used computational logic for the minimization of Boolean functions to predict the interplay of various regulatory interactions. We also used mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures to experimentally validate our predictions.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that Fgf8 maintains, rather than induces, Wnt1 expression at the MHB. We experimentally confirmed this prediction using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures, showing that Fgf8 only maintains, but does not induce, ectopic Wnt1 expression. We constructed a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB, including Otx2, Gbx2, Fgf8, Wnt1, En, and Pax. Analyses of Boolean, differential equation, and reaction-diffusion models of this network confirmed that it is able to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB and time-courses of expression patterns under wild-type and various knock-out conditions.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that spatial gene expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks, similar to temporal expression patterns. We show that the spatial gene expression patterns around the MHB help us understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the regulatory network at the MHB, highlighting the importance of Fgf8 in maintaining Wnt1 expression. We demonstrate that Boolean analysis of spatial gene expression patterns can be a powerful tool for inferring regulatory interactions and understanding complex biological systems. Our study contributes to the understanding of the development and patterning of the mid- and hindbrain during vertebrate development.

    **Title:** Theileria annulata Exploits Host Cell Microtubules through a Novel Interaction with End-Binding Protein 1 (EB1)

    **Research Question:** How does the apicomplexan parasite Theileria annulata interact with host cell microtubules (MTs) to secure its distribution between daughter cells during mitosis and cytokinesis?

    **Methods:** Using in vitro experiments, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Theileria annulata schizonts recruit and stabilize host cell MTs. We focused on the complex protein machinery associated with MT plus ends and identified the end-binding protein 1 (EB1) as a key regulator of host cell MT dynamics.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that Theileria annulata p104, a polymorphic antigen expressed on the schizont surface, functions as a genuine EB1-binding protein and can recruit EB1 in the absence of other parasite proteins. Binding strictly depends on a consensus SxIP motif located in a highly disordered C-terminal region of p104. We further showed that parasite interaction with host cell EB1 is cell cycle regulated.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton. The schizont's ability to recruit and stabilize host cell MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis is crucial for its persistence in the transformed host. The interaction between Theileria and host cell MTs is essential for the equal distribution of the schizont between daughter cells.

    **Conclusions:** This study is the first to describe a pathogen-encoded protein interacting with EB1 via a bona-fide SxIP motif. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton, which is essential for the parasite's survival and persistence in its host. The identification of p104 as an EB1-binding protein provides a new target for the development of therapeutic strategies against Theileria infections.

    **Title:** DNA Damage-Induced Telomere Lengthening via Break-Induced Replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between DNA damage, break-induced replication (BIR), and telomere lengthening in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of mild insufficiency in the replicative ligase Cdc9 on DNA damage, telomere length, and BIR in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, including genome-wide screens, deletion mutants, and biochemical assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that cdc9-1 cells exhibit persistent DNA damage, constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, and longer telomeres. Telomere lengthening in cdc9-1 cells requires functional telomerase, the core DNA damage signaling cascade Mec1-Rad9-Rad53, and the components of the BIR repair pathway – Rad51, Rad52, Pol32, and Pif1. We also found that the Mec1-Rad53-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 is essential for its role in BIR and telomere elongation in cdc9-1 cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity and leads to telomere lengthening. We propose a model in which DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 promotes telomere-stabilizing telomere extension while repressing deleterious de novo telomere addition events at DNA breaks.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the relationship between DNA damage, BIR, and telomere lengthening in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We propose that the constitutive generation of DNA damage in cdc9-1 cells leads to the activation of BIR, which in turn causes additional telomere lengthening. This mechanism may explain previous reports of telomere lengthening in other mutants with impaired DNA replication, such as rrm3Δ and cdc44-5. Our findings have implications for our understanding of telomere maintenance and the regulation of telomerase activity in response to DNA damage.
Title: Development of a Rapid and Specific Diagnostic Assay for Onchocerciasis Using Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS)

    Abstract:
    Onchocerciasis, caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, is a significant public health concern due to its debilitating symptoms and concerns about recrudescence in previously controlled areas. To address this issue, we investigated the use of luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) as a rapid, specific, and standardized diagnostic assay for Onchocerca volvulus infection. We tested four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens (Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1) on a large cohort of blinded sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other potentially cross-reactive infections.

    Our results show that antibody responses to the four different Onchocerca volvulus antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected control sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each of these four antigens in individual Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera revealed that they were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera, patients infected with Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other conditions had markedly lower geometric mean antibody titers to each of the Onchocerca volvulus 4 antigens (P < 0.0002 for each antigen).

    The simplified method of using a mixture of the 4 Onchocerca volvulus antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format (QLIPS) showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The QLIPS format had the best performance with 100% sensitivity and specificity values of 76%, 84%, and 93% for distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus from Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis-infected sera, respectively.

    Our findings suggest that the multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high-throughput, and specific tool to diagnose individual Onchocerca volvulus infections and as a sensitive and potentially point-of-care method for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus infection. This assay has the potential to enhance the antibody screening methodology and provide additional levels of confidence when decisions about cessation of control measures are being made.

    **Title:** Long-Term Efficacy of Population-Based Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation and Deworming in Reducing Anemia and Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infections in Rural Vietnamese Women

    **Research Question:** Can a population-based program of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular deworming effectively reduce anemia, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted helminth infections in a rural population of women of reproductive age in northern Vietnam?

    **Methods:** A prospective cohort study was conducted in a rural mountainous province of Vietnam, where 389 women aged 16-45 years were enrolled in a population-based program of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular deworming over 54 months. Hemoglobin levels, anemia prevalence, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted helminth infections were assessed at baseline and after 54 months.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed a significant reduction in anemia prevalence from 38% to 18%, iron deficiency from 23% to 8%, and iron deficiency anemia from 18% to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11%, and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. Mean hemoglobin levels increased from 122 g/L to 131 g/L.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that population-based interventions can efficiently and effectively reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helminth infections, maintaining them below the level of public health concern.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the long-term efficacy of a population-based program of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular deworming in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted helminth infections in a rural population of women of reproductive age in northern Vietnam. The high compliance rates with both deworming and weekly iron-folic acid supplements contributed to the significant reductions in anemia and soil-transmitted helminth infections. These findings support the implementation of similar programs in other resource-constrained settings to improve the health outcomes of women of reproductive age.

    **Title:** Identification of a Novel Immune Evasion Mechanism by Epstein-Barr Virus gp150: Implications for Cell-Mediated Immunity

    **Research Question:** How does Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) evade cell-mediated immunity during the replicative phase of infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of EBV gp150, a novel, broadly acting immunoevasin, in inhibiting antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d molecules during the late phase of viral replication.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that EBV gp150, encoded by the BDLF3 gene, is a heavily glycosylated protein that shields the surface presentation of antigen-presenting molecules, thereby inhibiting T-cell activation. This novel immune evasion mechanism does not depend on degradation of the antigen-presenting molecules nor does it require gp150's cytoplasmic tail. Instead, gp150's abundant glycosylation creates a shield that impedes surface presentation of antigen.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of herpesvirus biology and the role of cell-mediated immunity in fighting EBV infection. The identification of gp150 as a novel immune evasion molecule highlights the diverse strategies employed by herpesviruses to evade T-cell and iNKT cell immunity. Moreover, our results suggest that iNKT cells play a crucial role in anti-EBV immunity, which was previously inferred from the devastating effects of EBV infection in XLP patients.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study reveals a novel immune evasion mechanism employed by EBV gp150, which prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral life cycle. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat EBV infection and highlight the need for further investigation into the role of iNKT cells in anti-herpesvirus immunity.

    **Title:** Conservation of Tarp-Mediated Actin Nucleation among Pathogenic Chlamydial Species

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) in the pathogenesis of diverse chlamydial species?

    **Methods:** We generated a peptide antiserum specific for the Tarp actin binding domain and examined its ability to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro and C. trachomatis entry in vivo. We also performed sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from multiple chlamydial species and C. trachomatis serovars to identify putative actin binding sites. GST-Tarp fusions from various chlamydial species were used to assess their ability to bind and nucleate actin in vitro.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that Tarp-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species, including Caviae, C. muridarum, and various C. trachomatis serovars. We found that purified recombinant Tarps from all chlamydial species were capable of nucleating actin filament formation in vitro. Furthermore, a peptide antiserum with affinity to the actin binding domain prevented Tarp-mediated actin nucleation and significantly reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Tarp-mediated actin polymerization plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. The presence of multiple actin binding domains on a single polypeptide in some chlamydial strains and species may utilize a hybrid mechanism of actin nucleation, involving binding of multiple actin monomers to a single polypeptide and potentially synergistic with oligomerization mediated by the upstream proline-rich domain.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that Tarp-mediated actin nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and suggest that the actin binding domain plays an essential role in bacterial entry. These findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of chlamydial infections and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting Tarp-mediated actin polymerization.
Title: Enhanced Visualization of Schistosoma japonicum Eggs in Bovine Feces using the Formalin-Ethyl Acetate Sedimentation-Digestion (FEA-SD) Technique

    Abstract:
    Schistosomiasis japonica, a zoonotic disease, is a significant public health concern in the People's Republic of China, with water buffaloes serving as a major reservoir host contributing up to 75% to human transmission. Accurate determination of Schistosoma japonicum prevalence and intensity in mammalian hosts is crucial for calculating transmission rates and assessing environmental contamination. We developed a novel procedure, the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD) technique, to enhance visualization of S. japonicum eggs in bovine feces. This method involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy. By removing approximately 70% of bulk debris, including dense cellulosic material, the FEA-SD technique improves microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs and provides an accurate quantitative method for estimating infection in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts. Our results demonstrate that the FEA-SD technique is a valuable tool for surveillance of animal reservoirs of S. japonicum, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity or where schistosomiasis japonica control efforts are suspected to have eliminated the disease. The FEA-SD method is as efficient as real-time PCR (qPCR) for determining schistosome prevalence in bovines but is less costly to implement. This technique has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and monitoring of schistosomiasis japonica in bovines and other ruminant hosts.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Prolyl 3-Hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) in Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A Novel Mouse Model Reveals Differential Tissue Consequences

    Abstract:
    Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones, often caused by mutations in the genes encoding cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1), and cyclophilin B (PPIB). These proteins form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1(I) chain of collagen and has cis/trans isomerase activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent studies suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for collagen structural stability, but its absence may disrupt protein-protein interactions and lead to collagen over-modification. To investigate the relative contribution of P3H1's 3-hydroxylase and collagen chaperone activities to the OI phenotype, we generated a knock-in mouse model (Lepre1H662A/H662A) carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3H1. This mutation abolished P3H1 activity but retained its ability to form a complex with CRTAP, thus preserving its collagen chaperone function. Our results show that the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice lack prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the α1(I) and α1(II) collagen chains but exhibit normal cartilage growth plate histology and no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. Notably, these mice display decreased trabecular bone mass, recapitulating elements of the bone phenotype observed in OI patients. However, they do not exhibit the cartilage and growth phenotypes associated with complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our findings suggest that the loss of P3H1's 3-hydroxylase activity has differential tissue consequences compared to the complete absence of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, highlighting the complex interplay between collagen modification and protein-protein interactions in the development of OI.

    **Title:** Rapid Invasion and Adaptation of the P-Element in Drosophila simulans

    **Research Question:** How has the P-element, a selfish genetic element, invaded and adapted in Drosophila simulans, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster, and what are the implications of this invasion?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive survey of 631 Drosophila simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element using genomic and transcriptomic data. We also performed crosses between strains from different D. simulans populations to assess the hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the P-element invaded D. simulans rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. We also found that the hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in D. simulans is associated with the invasion of the P-element, and that strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element.

    **Implications:** The rapid spread of the P-element in D. simulans highlights the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish genetic elements. Our findings suggest that D. simulans has adapted to suppress the dysgenesis phenotype by the end of the invasion, underscoring the importance of strong selection to ameliorate the effects of the P-element. The lower rates of P-element induced gonadal dysgenesis in D. simulans compared to D. melanogaster may have contributed to the rapid spread of the P-element in D. simulans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the rapid invasion and adaptation of the P-element in D. simulans, a phenomenon that has significant implications for our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of selfish genetic elements. The findings of this study highlight the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring of the spread of such elements in natural populations.

    **Title:** Evaluation of Rhodamine B as a Rapid Diagnostic Tool for Assessing Mating Success of Sterilized Male Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus

    **Research Question:** Can rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, be used to stain the body tissue and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, allowing for rapid assessment of mating success during field releases?

    **Methods:** Male Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were fed 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhodamine B (w/v) in 50% honey solutions during free flight. The transfer of rhodamine B to females and the longevity of body marking were evaluated. Mating competitiveness was assessed in semi-field cages, and field releases were conducted to evaluate the transfer of marked seminal fluid to females.

    **Main Findings:** All concentrations of rhodamine B produced >95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days of feeding, with 0.4 and 0.8% solutions producing the longest-lasting body marking. Rhodamine B marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness, and proof-of-principle field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females under field conditions and recapture of marked males.

    **Implications:** Rhodamine B marking is a potentially useful evaluation method for male-based Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) and Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) control strategies, as well as a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments without the negative side-effects of traditional marking methods.

    **Conclusions:** Rhodamine B sugar-feeding successfully marked the body and seminal fluid of wild-type and Wolbachia-infected (wMel) Aedes aegypti, both lasting over the reported life expectancy of released males. The transfer of marked seminal fluid occurred at rates >95% post sugar-feeding with no impact on male competitiveness or survivorship relative to unmarked individuals. These results demonstrate the potential of rhodamine B as a rapid diagnostic tool for assessing mating success of sterilized male Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

    **Title:** CD28 Homodimer Interface as a Critical Receptor Target for Superantigens: A Novel Pathogen Recognition Mechanism

    **Research Question:** How do superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock, and what is the role of CD28, a homodimer expressed on T cells, in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between superantigens and CD28 using a combination of structural analysis, peptide mimetics, and functional assays in mice.

    **Main Findings:** We show that superantigens must bind directly to the dimer interface of CD28 to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity. Preventing access of the superantigen to CD28 suffices to block its lethality. Short peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface and peptides selected to compete with the superantigen for its binding site in CD28 protected mice from lethal superantigen challenge. Structural analysis revealed that superantigens use a conserved β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain to engage CD28, and mutation of this domain abolished inflammatory cytokine gene induction and lethality.

    **Implications:** Our findings identify the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigens, broadening the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms. This novel role of CD28 as a receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, the superantigen toxins, highlights the importance of CD28 in the immune response.

    **Conclusions:** Superantigens co-opt CD28 as a third receptor, in addition to its full reliance on costimulatory signaling through B7-2/CD28, to deliver the signal for Th1 cytokine induction. This unconventional use of CD28 by superantigens has significant implications for our understanding of the immune response and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat superantigen-mediated diseases. The identification of the CD28 dimer interface as a receptor target for superantigens provides a new avenue for the design of peptide-based therapeutics to block superantigen-mediated toxicity.

    **Title:** Wnt Signaling Regulates Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Proliferation and Pluripotency through Non-Overlapping Functions of Distinct Tcf Factors

    **Research Question:** How does the Wnt/β-catenin pathway control the cell cycle and proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) while maintaining their pluripotency?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including gene expression analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA interference (RNAi) to investigate the role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regulating mESC proliferation and pluripotency.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in mESCs leads to the recruitment of the transcription factor Tcf1 to the promoters of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf. This results in the downregulation of cell cycle progression and reduced proliferation of mESCs without affecting their pluripotency. In contrast, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has a mitogenic effect in somatic cells. Furthermore, we found that Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is responsible for the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which the Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates mESC proliferation and pluripotency through non-overlapping functions of distinct Tcf factors. This finding has significant implications for the safe use of mESCs in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls mESC proliferation and pluripotency through the recruitment of Tcf1 to the promoters of cell cycle repressor genes. This study provides new insights into the complex regulation of mESC biology and highlights the importance of Tcf1 in mediating the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.

    **Title:** Characterization of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Activation in Dengue Virus Infection: Implications for Disease Outcome

    **Research Question:** How do plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) contribute to the immune response against dengue virus (DENV) infection, and what is the relationship between pDC activation and disease severity?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate pDC activation in response to DENV-2 infection. Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to assess pDC activation markers, such as membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL) and soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL), as well as interferon-alpha (IFN-α) production. Three-dimensional microscopy was employed to visualize TRAIL relocalization in pDCs.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed that pDCs from mild dengue patients exhibited higher frequencies of mTRAIL expression compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and sTRAIL were also increased in mild dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. In vitro exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDCs, which was inhibited by chloroquine treatment. Furthermore, coculture of pDCs with DENV-2-infected monocytes revealed a dramatic decrease in antigen detection, which was also observed after exogenous IFN-α treatment.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that pDCs play a crucial role in the antiviral response against DENV-2 infection. The activation of pDCs, characterized by TRAIL and IFN-α production, is associated with mild dengue fever. The results also indicate that pDCs exert an antiviral activity in infected human primary monocytes, which may contribute to the control of viral clearance and diminish the severity of the disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role of pDCs in DENV-2 infection and highlights the importance of TRAIL-expressing pDCs in the outcome of the disease. The findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting pDCs to modulate the immune response against DENV infection.
Title: Investigating the Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Infection: A Computational Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is multifaceted, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a pivotal role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. However, TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been linked to an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation. This study employs a computational approach to characterize the role of TNF in protection against Mtb in both active and latent infection. We extend our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles and production of soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) and analyze the effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs). Our findings indicate that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor causing reactivation of latent infection, and sTNF, even at low levels, is essential for infection control. Using a mathematical model, we distinguish the mechanisms of action of anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the need to reduce inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to minimize the risk of TB reactivation. The results of this study have significant implications for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and the prevention of TB reactivation, particularly in areas where exposure to Mtb is likely.

Methods:
We employed a computational modeling approach to investigate the role of TNF in protection against Mtb in both active and latent infection. We extended our previous mathematical models to include the roles and production of sTNF and tmTNF and analyzed the effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs). We simulated two anti-TNF agents, a TNF-neutralizing antibody and a soluble p75 TNF receptor fusion (TNFR2Fc), to explore the effects of TNF blockade.

Main Findings:
Our findings indicate that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor causing reactivation of latent infection, and sTNF, even at low levels, is essential for infection control. Using a mathematical model, we distinguished the mechanisms of action of anti-TNF treatments and gained insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology.

Implications:
Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the need to reduce inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to minimize the risk of TB reactivation. The results of this study have significant implications for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and the prevention of TB reactivation, particularly in areas where exposure to Mtb is likely.

Conclusions:
This study provides new insights into the role of TNF in protection against Mtb in both active and latent infection. Our findings highlight the importance of sTNF in infection control and suggest that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the need to reduce inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. The results of this study have significant implications for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and the prevention of TB reactivation, particularly in areas where exposure to Mtb is likely.

    **Title:** Investigating Genetic Variation in Human Populations through Retrocopy Polymorphisms

    **Research Question:** What is the extent of genetic variation in human populations resulting from retrocopy polymorphisms, specifically retroduplication variations (RDVs), and how do these variations impact gene expression and population history?

    **Methods:** We analyzed genomic data from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project and RNA-Seq data from the Illumina BodyMap project and the Geuvadis Consortium to investigate the presence and expression of retrocopies in 17 different human populations. We also developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome.

    **Main Findings:** We detected 193 RDVs, the majority of which resulted from retrocopy deletion. Most of these RDVs had not been previously reported. We experimentally confirmed the expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes that underwent deletion in certain individuals, and found that the expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of 10 of these retrocopies suggest some functionality. We also identified 9 retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression between populations.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that retrocopy polymorphisms are not only useful markers for human population history, but also provide insight into ongoing evolutionary processes. The presence or absence of expressed retrocopies, as well as differences in retrocopy expression levels between populations, can inform our understanding of genetic variation and its impact on gene function.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the value of retrocopy polymorphisms as a tool for investigating genetic variation in human populations. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the presence and absence of retrocopies in the human genome, as well as their expression levels, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic diversity. Further research is needed to fully explore the functional implications of retrocopy polymorphisms and their role in shaping human evolution.
Title: Modulation of Inflammatory Responses to Taenia solium Cysticerci in the Central Nervous System: A Comparative Study of Parenchymal, Meningeal, and Corticomeningeal Locations

    Abstract:

    Background: Neurocysticercosis (NCC), caused by Taenia solium cysticerci, is a pleomorphic disease characterized by variable inflammation around cysticerci in the central nervous system (CNS). The location and characteristics of the brain tissue adjacent to cysticerci may modulate the inflammatory response. We investigated the inflammatory responses to cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma, meninges, or both tissues, and the effect of anthelmintic treatment on these responses.

    Methods: Histological specimens from 196 brain cysticerci from 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cysticerci were analyzed. Four pigs were sacrificed after 2 days and four after 5 days of a single dose of praziquantel, while three pigs did not receive treatment. Evans Blue was injected intravenously to assess disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The degree of inflammation was estimated using a histological score (ISC) based on the extent of inflammation in the pericystic areas.

    Results: Parenchymal cysticerci provoked a significantly greater level of pericystic inflammation (higher ISC) after antiparasitic treatment compared to meningeal and corticomeningeal cysticerci. The ISC of meningeal cysticerci was not significantly affected by treatment. In corticomeningeal cysticerci, the increase in ISC score was correlated with the extent of the cysticercus adjacent to the brain parenchyma. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment only in parenchymal tissue. Inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to parenchymal cysticerci.

    Implications: The suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs may be the reason subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC. These findings suggest that the location and characteristics of cysticerci in the CNS modulate the inflammatory response to anthelmintic treatment.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the CNS influences the inflammatory response to anthelmintic treatment. Parenchymal cysticerci elicit a more pronounced inflammatory response compared to meningeal and corticomeningeal cysticerci. These findings have important implications for the treatment and management of NCC, particularly in cases where cysticerci are located in the subarachnoid space.
Title: Investigating the Endemicity of Yaws in Ghana: A Cross-Sectional Survey in Two Districts with a History of Trachoma Mass Drug Administration

Abstract:
Background: Yaws, caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, is reportedly endemic in Ghana, with ongoing reporting of cases despite mass distribution of azithromycin as part of the WHO yaws eradication campaign. We aimed to investigate the presence of yaws in two districts of Ghana where mass drug administration (MDA) for trachoma had previously been conducted.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 30 communities in two districts of Ghana, enrolling children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws. Samples for treponemal serology, lesion PCR, and syphilis serology were collected from all children. A total of 90 children with 98 lesions were enrolled.

Results: Syphilis serology was negative in all children, and PCR for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue was negative in all children. However, Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The majority of lesions remained unexplained.

Conclusion: Our study found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities, which had previously been treated for trachoma. The detection of H. ducreyi DNA in some lesions suggests that alternative infections may be responsible for some cases. Our findings have implications for the WHO yaws eradication campaign, highlighting the need for integration of diagnostic testing into both pre- and post-MDA surveillance systems to better inform yaws control programs.

Title: Targeting the Jak-STAT Pathway to Overcome HIV Persistence: A Novel Therapeutic Strategy

Background: Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV persistence remains a significant challenge. T cell homeostasis is a major driver of HIV persistence, and cytokines involved in regulating memory T cell homeostasis trigger the Jak-STAT pathway. We investigated the role of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence and evaluated the efficacy of two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, in blocking HIV reservoir establishment, maintenance, and expansion.

Methods: We used in vitro and ex vivo models to evaluate the effects of tofacitinib and ruxolitinib on the Jak-STAT pathway and HIV persistence. We monitored STAT5 phosphorylation following γ-C receptor cytokine stimulation in total CD4 T cells and in memory subsets known to harbor the HIV reservoir in the presence or absence of Jak inhibitors. We also investigated the association between the Jak-STAT pathway and HIV persistence in a cohort of aviremic ART-treated participants (n = 37).

Main Findings: Our results show that Jak inhibitors block viral production from infected cells, inhibit γ-C receptor cytokine (IL-15)-induced viral reactivation from latent stores, and prevent transmission of infectious particles to bystander activated T cells. We demonstrate that Jak inhibitors confer STAT5-mediated block in homeostatic proliferation and inflammation-driven HIV reservoir expansion. Importantly, we show that ruxolitinib or tofacitinib inhibit signaling of the Jak-STAT pathway in all memory T cell subsets known to harbor the HIV reservoir.

Implications: Our findings suggest that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence in vivo, and that Jak inhibitors target key events downstream of γ-C cytokine (IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15) ligation to their receptors, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets in vitro and ex vivo. Jak inhibitors represent a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence and may be integrated into future curative strategies.

Conclusions: Our study provides direct evidence for the involvement of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence and demonstrates the efficacy of Jak inhibitors in blocking HIV reservoir establishment, maintenance, and expansion. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome HIV persistence and achieve a functional cure.

    **Research Question:** How do Spodoptera exigua cells and larvae respond to infection with species-specific (SeMNPV) and generalist (AcMNPV) baculoviruses, and what is the role of gut microbiota in viral infection?

    **Methods:** Microarray analysis was used to investigate gene expression in S. exigua cells challenged with SeMNPV and AcMNPV. Gene expression was also analyzed in the larval gut of S. exigua infected with SeMNPV.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to the expected host transcriptional shut-off, S. exigua cells showed a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes during the first 36 hours following infection with both SeMNPV and AcMNPV. Immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins, signaling and immune pathways, immune effectors, and genes involved in the melanization cascade, were down-regulated after baculovirus infection. The down-regulation of immune-related genes was confirmed in the larval gut. Furthermore, an increase in gut bacterial load was observed, which was hypothesized to be a consequence of viral infection. Subsequent experiments revealed that gut bacteria enhanced baculovirus virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that S. exigua cells and larvae respond to baculovirus infection by down-regulating immune-related genes, which may provide an advantage to the virus. The increase in gut bacterial load may contribute to the enhanced virulence and pathogenicity of the virus.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the host immune response processes and pathways affected by baculoviruses, as well as the role of gut microbiota in viral infection. The results suggest that baculoviruses manipulate host immune responses to their advantage, and that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in viral infection. These findings have important implications for the development of novel strategies to control baculovirus infections in insect pests.

    **Title:** Induction of Apomixis in Arabidopsis thaliana through Genetic Manipulation of Meiotic Processes

    **Research Question:** Can apomixis, a form of asexual clonal reproduction through seeds, be induced in Arabidopsis thaliana by genetically manipulating key meiotic processes?

    **Methods:** We isolated and characterized a novel gene involved in controlling entry into the second meiotic division. By combining a mutation in this gene with two others that affect key meiotic processes (osd1, Atrec8, and Atspo11-1), we created a genotype called MiMe, in which meiosis is replaced by mitosis.

    **Main Findings:** The MiMe genotype exhibited a fully penetrant apomeiosis phenotype, characterized by the replacement of meiosis with a mitotic-like division. This resulted in the production of functional diploid gametes that were genetically identical to their mother plant. The MiMe plants generated dyads and were fertile, producing quasi-wild type levels of viable and apomeiotic ovules and pollen grains.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that apomixis can be induced in Arabidopsis thaliana through genetic manipulation of meiotic processes. The creation of the MiMe genotype and apomeiosis phenotype is an important step towards understanding and engineering apomixis, which has significant potential applications in agriculture.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the genetic control of apomixis and demonstrates the feasibility of inducing apomixis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The MiMe genotype offers a valuable tool for further research into the mechanisms of apomixis and its potential applications in plant breeding and agriculture. The ability to produce genetically identical offspring through seeds has significant implications for the development of new crop varieties with desirable traits, such as improved yield, disease resistance, and drought tolerance.

    Title: Tissue-Specific Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Enhance Gene Prioritization for Disease-Causing Genes

    Research Question: Can tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks improve the prioritization of candidate disease-causing genes compared to generic PPI networks?

    Methods: We constructed tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 healthy human tissues by integrating gene expression data from those tissues. We then applied a gene prioritization algorithm, PRINCE, to both the original and tissue-specific PPI networks in a cross-validation setting.

    Main Findings: Our results show that tissue-specific PPI networks significantly improve the prioritization results compared to generic PPI networks. The tissue-specific variant of the algorithm yields higher area under the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) and gives the correct gene a higher ranking than the original variant more often than not. Furthermore, we found that a large majority (71-83%) of known disease-causing genes are significantly expressed in the corresponding disease-associated tissue, supporting the hypothesis that a gene is likely to be expressed in a healthy tissue for its mutation to clinically manifest in that tissue.

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of incorporating tissue-specific information into gene prioritization methods. By using tissue-specific PPI networks, we can improve the accuracy of gene prioritization and predict novel disease-tissue associations that may escape early detection. This has significant implications for the identification of disease-causing genes and the development of targeted therapies.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that tissue-specific PPI networks are a valuable tool for improving gene prioritization and predicting disease-tissue associations. By integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with PPI information, we can construct tissue-specific PPI networks that enhance the performance of gene prioritization algorithms. This approach has the potential to accelerate the discovery of disease-causing genes and improve our understanding of the complex relationships between genes, tissues, and diseases.

    **Title:** A Flexible Two-Locus Model for the Spread of Insecticide Resistance in Mosquito Populations

    **Research Question:** What are the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria?

    **Methods:** We developed a flexible, two-locus model that allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide, as well as varying selection pressures and dominance values depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. We conducted a sensitivity analysis over an extensive parameter space to investigate the relative performance of mixture and sequential strategies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that both strategies can last more than 500 mosquito generations (approximately 40 years) in 24% of runs, while in those runs where resistance had spread to high levels by 500 generations, 56% favored sequential use and 44% favored mixtures. We found that mixtures are favored when insecticide effectiveness is high and exposure is low. Conversely, if insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes, sequential deployment may be a more robust strategy.

    **Implications:** Our model suggests that resistance to an insecticide always spreads slower when used in a mixture, although this may not be sufficient to outperform sequential use. For example, a mixture may last 5 years, while the two insecticides deployed individually may last 3 and 4 years, resulting in an overall "lifespan" of 7 years for sequential use.

    **Conclusions:** We emphasize that this paper is primarily about designing and implementing a flexible modeling strategy to investigate the spread of insecticide resistance in vector populations. Our results demonstrate how our model can identify vector control strategies most likely to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance. We do not advocate for mixtures or sequential deployment as a universal policy measure, but rather highlight the importance of considering the attributes of the insecticides, their application, mosquito behavior, and genetics when making decisions about vector control strategies.

    Title: Unveiling the Sialome of Rhodnius neglectus: Insights into Hematophagy and Vector-Host Interactions

    Background: Rhodnius neglectus is a hematophagous insect that contributes to the transmission of Chagas disease, a significant public health concern in the Americas. The saliva of hematophagous arthropods contains bioactive molecules that counteract host haemostatic, inflammatory, and immune responses. Next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification were employed to investigate the sialome of R. neglectus.

    Research Question: What is the composition of the sialome of R. neglectus, and how do its secreted proteins contribute to hematophagy and vector-host interactions?

    Methods: Next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification were used to analyze the sialome of R. neglectus. A total of 4,230 coding DNA sequences (CDS) were deposited in GenBank, and 636 CDS of proteins of putative secretory nature were extracted from the assembled reads. Proteomic analysis confirmed 73 of these proteins.

    Main Findings: The sialome of R. neglectus was characterized, revealing the presence of ubiquitous protein families, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5. Metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families were less abundant. Notably, serine protease transcripts were detected in the sialome of R. neglectus.

    Implications: The data presented expand our understanding of hematophagous arthropod sialomes and provide insights into the complex interplay between vectors and their vertebrate hosts. The identification of serine proteases in the sialome of R. neglectus highlights the potential role of these molecules in hematophagy and vector-host interactions.

    Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the sialome of R. neglectus, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying hematophagy and vector-host interactions. The discovery of serine proteases in the sialome of R. neglectus suggests that these molecules may play a crucial role in the transmission of Chagas disease. Future studies should investigate the functional characterization of these proteins and their role in hematophagy and vector-host interactions.

    Title: Functional Significance of Differentially Expressed Genes in Caenorhabditis elegans in Response to Different Bacterial Environments

    Research Question: Do differentially expressed genes in Caenorhabditis elegans in response to various bacterial environments predict functional importance and influence nematode community dynamics in natural systems?

    Methods: We employed Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to investigate the interaction between native soil nematode taxa and soil bacteria. Using transcriptional profiling, we identified candidate genes regulated in response to different bacteria isolated in association with grassland nematodes or from grassland soils. We then used mutations to inactivate 21 of the identified genes and measured their effect on lifespan and fitness in a given bacterial environment.

    Main Findings: Our results show that many of the regulated candidate genes are predicted to affect metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting that similar genes could influence nematode community dynamics in natural systems. We found that most of the inactivated genes contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment, indicating that differential gene expression is predictive of functional importance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, can have a large effect on gene expression, with important consequences for fitness.

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of considering the functional significance of differentially expressed genes in response to environmental conditions. The results suggest that differential gene expression can predict the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments. This has important implications for understanding the responses of bactivorous soil nematodes to their bacterial environment and the potential consequences for nematode community dynamics in natural systems.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model for understanding the responses of bactivorous soil nematodes to their bacterial environment. The results of this study provide new insights into the functional significance of differentially expressed genes in response to environmental conditions and highlight the importance of considering the functional significance of gene expression in understanding the responses of organisms to their environment.

    **Title:** The Role of Gene Expression Noise in Robust Establishment of the Inner Cell Mass and Trophoectoderm in Mammalian Embryos

    **Research Question:** What are the design principles responsible for the robust establishment of the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophoectoderm (TE) in mammalian embryos, and what is the role of gene expression noise in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed multi-scale, stochastic modeling to investigate the dynamics of ICM and TE formation in mouse blastocysts. Quantitative imaging and gene expression analysis were used to validate the predictions made by the model.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that stochasticity in the expression of critical genes, such as Cdx2 and Oct4, promotes cell plasticity and plays a crucial role in accurately organizing the developing mouse blastocyst. We found that asymmetry in the levels of noise variation (expression fluctuation) of Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while ameliorating the potentially detrimental effects of stochasticity. Furthermore, our results suggest that the embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, creating a time window during which each cell can continually read its environment and adjust its fate.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. The results support the hypothesis that gene expression noise has a substantial positive influence on TE/ICM organization and adds significant robustness to the correct structural arrangement of mouse blastocysts.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the design principles responsible for the robust establishment of the ICM and TE in mammalian embryos. The results suggest that noise-induced plasticity has the capacity to improve organization, and that asymmetries in noise sources provide a mechanism to promote this noise-mediated plasticity without overwhelming the system's dynamics. These findings have important implications for our understanding of embryonic development and the role of gene expression noise in maintaining cellular plasticity.

    **Title:** Structural Flexibility in Germline Gene-Encoded Antibodies Enables Polyspecific Binding to Diverse Antigens

    **Research Question:** Can germline gene-encoded antibodies be optimized for polyspecificity, allowing them to bind to multiple, diverse antigens simultaneously?

    **Methods:** We employed the Rosetta multi-state design algorithm to computationally redesign panels of somatically mutated antibodies encoded by a common VH gene, each binding to a different antigen. The algorithm predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing the residues that enable polyspecificity. We found that key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework are critical contributors to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned sequences similar to the mature antibody sequence, mimicking natural antibody maturation in silico.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. The ability to design antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow for the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding. This has significant implications for the development of therapeutic antibodies that can target multiple disease-related antigens simultaneously.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that germline gene-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity, and that the Rosetta multi-state design algorithm can predict antibody sequences that are inherently flexible and capable of adopting diverse conformations to bind to multiple antigens. By reversing antibody maturation in silico, we have identified key positions in the VH gene that contribute to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. This study provides a crucial step towards rational antibody design, enabling the development of therapeutic antibodies that can target multiple disease-related antigens simultaneously.

    **Title:** Modeling the Emergence of Locust Hopper Bands: A Quantitative Framework for Collective Gregarization

    **Research Question:** What are the conditions under which locusts transition from a solitarious to a gregarious phase, leading to the formation of destructive hopper bands?

    **Methods:** We developed a partial integrodifferential equation model that incorporates the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level. Stability analysis of our model revealed conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large-scale transition to the gregarious phase. Model reduction enabled quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase, the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and the time scale for this to occur.

    **Main Findings:** Our model predicts that in the limit of low densities, both phases are uniformly spread and the solitarious phase dominates. However, for sufficiently large populations, a dense, traveling patch of gregarious locusts suddenly emerges, while solitarious locusts become more and more scarce. We identified locust clustering at high densities with the onset of a hopper band and calculated the critical density beyond which the gregarious group forms. Numerical simulations illustrated the rapid transitions that take place once gregarization is initiated, resulting in dense packs of gregarious locusts that form and grow, sweeping up solitarious locusts in their vicinity.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a quantitative framework for understanding the emergence of locust hopper bands, a key early process that precedes destructive locust outbreaks. By linking individual-level phase change and interphase interactions to predictions at the level of the gregarious hopper band, our model sheds light on the conditions under which locusts transition from a solitarious to a gregarious phase. These findings have important implications for the development of early warning systems and control strategies for locust outbreaks.

    **Conclusions:** Our research addresses the open problem of quantifying and describing collective gregarization, a critical process that necessarily occurs before the emergence of a destructive locust outbreak. By combining mathematical modeling and numerical simulations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of hopper band formation and the conditions under which locusts transition from a solitarious to a gregarious phase.

    **Title:** Dissecting the Flavivirus Membrane Fusion Pathway using Alkaline pH Conditions

    **Research Question:** What are the intermediate structures of the flavivirus membrane fusion pathway, and how do they contribute to the fusion process?

    **Methods:** We employed an in vitro liposome fusion assay with pyrene phospholipid-labeled tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and unilamellar liposomes to investigate the flavivirus membrane fusion pathway. We exposed TBEV particles to alkaline pH conditions (pH 5.4, 8.0, and 10.0) to trap the particles in intermediate conformations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that exposure of TBEV particles to alkaline pH conditions (pH 8.0 and 10.0) traps the particles in an intermediate conformation where the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide, but do not proceed to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH (pH 5.4) leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the flavivirus membrane fusion pathway, revealing two separate steps: (1) membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers, and (2) formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events sheds light on the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.

    **Conclusions:** The use of nonphysiological conditions (alkaline pH) allows for the dissection of the flavivirus fusion process, enabling the identification of intermediate structures that play a crucial role in the fusion pathway. Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of viral membrane fusion and may provide new targets for the development of antiviral therapies. The identification of these intermediate structures also highlights the complexity of the flavivirus fusion process, which involves a series of triggered conformational changes of the viral envelope glycoprotein E.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Drivers of Extinction Risk in Plants: A Phylogenetic Analysis of the Cape Floristic Region

    **Research Question:** What are the underlying drivers of extinction risk in plants, specifically in the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot?

    **Methods:** We compared Red List data for the British and South African floras to investigate the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk. We constructed a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape flora and analyzed the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades. We used Harmon and colleagues' index of disparity through time (DTT) to describe variance in extinction risk between and within clades.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, inconsistent with a simple, trait-based model of extinction. We found a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks, but the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Our analysis suggests that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape flora.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions such as the Cape, where speciation has been rapid. We show that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, we find that the most vulnerable plant species are marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects.

    **Conclusions:** Our results highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of extinction risk in plants, particularly in regions with rapid speciation. We suggest that species turnover (speciation and extinction) might be rapid generally for plants, and high extinction rates may not be unusual over evolutionary timescales. Our study underscores the importance of considering phylogenetic relationships and mode of speciation in conservation efforts to maximize the preservation of the tree-of-life.
Title: Identification of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase and Vav1 as Novel Interactors of Dectin-1 in Candida albicans Phagocytosis

    Abstract:

    Background: Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. Phagocytosis of C. albicans by cells of the innate immune system is crucial for preventing infection. Dectin-1 is the major phagocytic receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity.

    Research Question: What are the molecular mechanisms underlying Dectin-1-mediated phagocytosis of C. albicans, and what are the roles of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1 in this process?

    Methods: We used RAW-Dectin1 macrophages to investigate the expression of BTK, Vav1, and other proteins involved in Dectin-1-mediated phagocytosis. Live C. albicans was incubated with RAW-Dectin1 macrophages, and phagocytosis was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.

    Main Findings: We identified BTK and Vav1 as two new interacting proteins of Dectin-1 in macrophages. BTK and Vav1 were recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae, but were absent from mature phagosomes. BTK and Vav1 localized to cuff regions surrounding the hyphae, while Dectin-1 lined the full length of the phagosome. BTK and Vav1 colocalized with PI(3,4,5)P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol (DAG), which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, we showed that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages displayed a defect in both zymosan and C. albicans phagocytosis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages that lacked BTK or Vav1 showed reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice were more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild-type mice.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that BTK and Vav1 play a crucial role in Dectin-1-mediated phagocytosis of C. albicans. The recruitment of BTK and Vav1 to the phagocytic cup is essential for the formation of PI(3,4,5)P3-rich membranes and the subsequent phagocytosis of C. albicans.

    Conclusions: This study identifies BTK and Vav1 as novel interactors of Dectin-1 in C. albicans phagocytosis. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Dectin-1-mediated phagocytosis and highlight the importance of BTK and Vav1 in anti-fungal immunity.

    **Title:** Environmental and Behavioral Factors Contributing to Rift Valley Fever Transmission in Madagascar

    **Background:** Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans, with Madagascar experiencing significant outbreaks in 2008-2009. Understanding the environmental and behavioral factors contributing to RVF transmission is crucial for optimizing surveillance and control measures.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to identify the environmental factors and areas favorable to RVF transmission to both cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors favoring human infections in Malagasy contexts.

    **Methods:** We employed a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to characterize the environments of Malagasy communes and analyzed cattle and human serological data using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. We examined the association between environmental factors, cattle density, human behavior, and seroprevalence rates.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that humid environments (p < 0.001) and high cattle density (p < 0.01, OR = 2.6) were positively associated with cattle and human seroprevalence rates. Frequent contact with raw milk also contributed to human infection (OR = 1.6). Our analysis highlighted the eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts of Madagascar as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle.

    **Implications:** Our study suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintaining RVF enzootic transmission. The association between cattle seroprevalence, humid environments, and high cattle density indicates that vectorial transmission probably occurs in both cattle and humans in at-risk areas. The relative contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions could be further assessed by mathematical modeling.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar, highlighting the importance of environmental and behavioral factors. Our findings have implications for optimizing RVF surveillance and control measures, particularly in areas with high cattle density and humid environments. Further research is needed to evaluate the relative contribution of vectorial and direct transmissions in different eco-climatic areas.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Mechanisms of Prion Transmission Barriers: A Yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-Based Experimental System

    **Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms of transmission barriers between non-identical prion proteins, specifically between homologous proteins from different species?

    **Methods:** We employed a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system to investigate the nature of transmission barriers. We analyzed the prion domain of Rnq1, which carries four discrete QN-rich regions, and tested the ability of Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants to transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Rnq1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. We found that one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission, but transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength, even in the absence of amino acid mismatches in transmitting regions. This suggests that multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and transmission barriers are determined by this cooperative fold.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of prion transmission barriers, which are crucial for understanding the propagation of prion diseases. The existence of transmission barriers in the absence of amino acid mismatches highlights the importance of cooperative interactions between prion determinants in achieving the final prion conformation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the prion domain of Rnq1 carries multiple determinants capable of independently supporting the prion state, and that transmission barriers are determined by the cooperative fold of these determinants. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of prion biology and the development of strategies to prevent the transmission of prion diseases. The yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system used in this study provides a valuable tool for further investigating the mechanisms of prion transmission barriers and the cooperative interactions between prion determinants.

    **Title:** Deep Learning for Joint Inference of Demography and Selection in Population Genetics

    **Research Question:** Can deep learning be employed as a novel likelihood-free inference framework for jointly inferring natural selection and demography in population genetics?

    **Methods:** We developed a deep learning approach that utilizes multilayer neural networks to learn a feature-based function from summary statistics of genomic data to population genetic parameters of interest. This method allows for the simultaneous inference of demography and selection without sequential steps.

    **Main Findings:** We applied our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia and found that it can effectively separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection. Our results indicate that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Additionally, our demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning as a new inference framework for population genomic analysis. Our method provides a way to distinguish informative summary statistics from uninformative ones and can accommodate more complex models than existing techniques. This approach can be used to select optimal statistics for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or other likelihood-free inference methods.

    **Conclusions:** Our results show that deep learning can be effectively employed for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data. The joint inference of demography and selection is a challenging problem in population genetics, and our method provides a complimentary approach to existing likelihood-free inference methods. Future directions include applying deep learning to a wider variety of scenarios in population genetics and exploring hybrid approaches that combine deep learning with other methods, such as ABC or Support Vector Machines (SVM). The prospect of using deep learning to classify regions as neutral or selected is particularly appealing for subsequent demographic inference.
Title: Persistent Expression of High-Risk HPV Oncogenes Disrupts the Fanconi Anemia DNA Repair Pathway and Sensitizes Cells to Cisplatin-Induced DNA Damage

    Abstract:
    Human Papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6 and E7 play a crucial role in the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. We investigated the mechanisms by which E6/E7 disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Our results show that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin and exhibit defects in repairing ICLs. We found that E6/E7 activates the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, but inhibits the completion of the repair by multiple mechanisms. Specifically, E6/E7 impairs FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks (DSBs), hindering the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSBs. Furthermore, E6 expression causes delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, which is critical for effective ICL repair. This delay is associated with increased chromatin retention of FancD2, hindering USP1 de-ubiquitinating activity and persistently activating ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework for how HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies. These results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the FA pathway in HPV-positive cancers.

    Research Question:
    How do HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 disrupt the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway and contribute to genomic instability in anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the effects of E6/E7 on the FA pathway. We employed Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and cell fractionation to analyze the expression and localization of FancD2, Rad51, and other proteins involved in the FA pathway.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to cisplatin and exhibit defects in repairing ICLs. We found that E6/E7 activates the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, but inhibits the completion of the repair by multiple mechanisms. Specifically, E6/E7 impairs FancD2 colocalization with DSBs, hindering the recruitment of Rad51 to DSBs. Furthermore, E6 expression causes delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, which is critical for effective ICL repair.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide a mechanistic framework for how HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies. These results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the FA pathway in HPV-positive cancers.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study demonstrates that persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 disrupts the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, leading to hypersensitivity to cisplatin and genomic instability in anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. These findings highlight the importance of targeting the FA pathway in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HPV-positive cancers.
Title: Interruption of Onchocerciasis Transmission in the Southern Chiapas Focus of Mexico

    Abstract:
    The Southern Chiapas focus of onchocerciasis in Mexico represents one of the major onchocerciasis foci in Latin America, with 559 endemic communities undergoing semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin since 1998. To assess the effectiveness of this control strategy, in-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were conducted in six sentinel communities (2 rounds of ivermectin treatment per year) and three extra-sentinel communities (4 rounds of ivermectin treatment per year). The results show that none of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum s.l. black flies collected during the dry season of 2011 contained Onchocerca volvulus DNA, indicating an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-ULCI) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Furthermore, serological assays revealed that only 2 out of 4,230 children 5 years of age and under (0.05%; one-sided 95% confidence interval = 0.08%) were exposed to O. volvulus. These findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community, indicating a significant reduction in the transmission of onchocerciasis in the Southern Chiapas focus.

    Methods:
    In-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were conducted in six sentinel communities (2 rounds of ivermectin treatment per year) and three extra-sentinel communities (4 rounds of ivermectin treatment per year). Simulium ochraceum s.l. black flies were collected using standardized procedures and tested for Onchocerca volvulus DNA using polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA). Serological assays were conducted on 4,230 children 5 years of age and under to assess exposure to O. volvulus.

    Main Findings:
    The results show that none of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum s.l. black flies collected during the dry season of 2011 contained Onchocerca volvulus DNA, indicating an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-ULCI) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Furthermore, serological assays revealed that only 2 out of 4,230 children 5 years of age and under (0.05%; one-sided 95% confidence interval = 0.08%) were exposed to O. volvulus.

    Implications:
    The findings of this study indicate that the control strategy of semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin has been effective in reducing the transmission of onchocerciasis in the Southern Chiapas focus. The interruption of transmission in this focus has significant implications for the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas, which aims to eliminate new ocular morbidity caused by infection with O. volvulus and eventually eliminate transmission of the parasite in all 13 foci in Latin America.

    Conclusions:
    The in-depth epidemiologic and entomologic findings from the Southern Chiapas focus meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community, indicating a significant reduction in the transmission of onchocerciasis in this region. The results of this study provide evidence that the control strategy of semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin has been effective in reducing the transmission of onchocerciasis in the Southern Chiapas focus, and support the goal of the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas.

    Title: Identification of a Small Peptide Pheromone, pPplA, Secreted by Listeria monocytogenes that Enhances Vacuolar Escape and Facilitates PrfA Activation

    Background: Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cell cytosol. The transcriptional activator PrfA regulates gene products required for intracellular bacterial growth and bacterial spread to adjacent cells. However, the signal that stimulates PrfA activation has not been defined.

    Research Question: What is the role of a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, secreted by L. monocytogenes in enhancing vacuolar escape and facilitating PrfA activation?

    Methods: We investigated the function of the PplA lipoprotein and/or the pPplA peptide in L. monocytogenes physiology and mammalian infection using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches.

    Main Findings: We found that L. monocytogenes secretes a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, which is generated via the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. The pPplA pheromone enhances the escape of L. monocytogenes from host cell vacuoles and may facilitate PrfA activation. Bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Mutational activation of PrfA restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the pPplA peptide pheromone plays a crucial role in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis by signaling to the bacteria its presence within the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol.

    Conclusions: We propose a working model for the role of pPplA in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis, where the pPplA peptide pheromone is released by L. monocytogenes following its cleavage and processing from the secretion signal sequence of the PplA lipoprotein. Our data suggests that pPplA may serve to signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the host cell vacuole, enhancing vacuolar escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol.

    **Title:** Temporal Adaptive Strategy of Vibrio cholerae to Overcome Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) during Infection

    **Research Question:** How does Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, adapt to overcome reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the host during infection?

    **Methods:** We employed a whole-genome transposon sequencing analysis (Tn-seq) to compare gene requirements for colonization in adult mice with and without treatment of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). We also used a streptomycin-treated mouse model to study V. cholerae ROS resistance in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, such as MutS, displayed significant colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice, but not in NAC-treated mice. Further analysis revealed that the accumulation of catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC-treated mice was the leading cause of MutS mutant enrichment caused by oxidative stress during infection. We also found that rugose variants could revert back to smooth colonies upon aerobic, in vitro culture. Additionally, the mutation rate of wildtype colonized in NAC-treated mice was significantly higher than that in NAC+ mice.

    **Implications:** Our findings support a paradigm in which V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. This strategy involves the accumulation of beneficial mutations, such as catalase overproduction and rugose colony formation, which enable the bacteria to overcome oxidative stress.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms utilized by V. cholerae to overcome ROS during infection. The use of Tn-seq and a streptomycin-treated mouse model allowed us to identify key genes involved in ROS resistance, including the MMR system. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat V. cholerae infections. Moreover, our results suggest that ΔmutS passage and complementation can be used to model hypermutation in diverse pathogens to identify novel stress resistance mechanisms.

    Title: Elucidating the Structure-Function Relationship of Mlh1-Mlh3 in Meiosis and DNA Mismatch Repair

    Background: Mlh1-Mlh3 is a heterodimeric endonuclease hypothesized to play a crucial role in resolving double Holliday junctions into crossovers during meiosis. Additionally, it has a minor role in eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR). To understand how Mlh1-Mlh3 functions in both meiosis and MMR, we analyzed 60 new mlh3 alleles in baker’s yeast.

    Methods: We identified five alleles that specifically disrupted MMR and one allele (mlh3-32) that specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. Mlh1-mlh3 representatives for each class were purified and characterized. Both Mlh1-mlh3-32 (MMR+, crossover-) and Mlh1-mlh3-45 (MMR-, crossover+) displayed wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro. Msh2-Msh3, an MSH complex that acts with Mlh1-Mlh3 in MMR, stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions.

    Main Findings: Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and MMR+ crossover-, MMR- crossover+, endonuclease defective, and null mlh3 mutants in an S288c/YJM789 hybrid background. Compared to wild-type, all mlh3 mutants showed increases in the number of noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative recombination pathways.

    Implications: Our observations provide a structure-function map for Mlh3, revealing the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3’s enzymatic activity. They also illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights for how meiotic recombination pathways are regulated.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3’s endonuclease activity in both meiosis and MMR. The identification of mlh3 mutations that specifically disrupt MMR or meiotic crossing over provides a framework for understanding the structure-function relationship of Mlh1-Mlh3. These findings have significant implications for understanding the regulation of meiotic recombination pathways and the consequences of defective meiotic components.

**Title:** The Role of Host Contact Structure in the Reversion Dynamics of Drug-Resistant Pathogens

**Research Question:** How does the structure of the host population, specifically heterogeneity in the number of contacts, influence the reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens after the discontinuation of antibiotic treatment?

**Methods:** Using a non-self-limiting susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on a heterogeneous contact network, we simulated the emergence and reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens in the presence and absence of treatment.

**Main Findings:** Our simulations show that host contact structure plays a crucial role in the reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens. During treatment, the non-random distribution of resistant strains among the infected population leads to a higher fraction of resistant infections and a lower fraction of sensitive infections. After treatment is stopped, the competition dynamics between wild-type and resistant strains is influenced by the host contact structure, resulting in a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability of reversion to sensitivity on the population level. We found that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal when fitness costs of resistance are small, which is a biologically plausible parameter range for many pathogen-drug combinations.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the structure of the host population in understanding the reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens. The findings have significant implications for the development of strategies to mitigate the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, particularly in the context of non-self-limiting diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and gonorrhea.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens are influenced by both the fitness costs of resistance and the structure of the host population. By taking into account the heterogeneity in the number of contacts among hosts, we can better understand the complex interactions between pathogens and their hosts, ultimately informing the development of more effective strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.

    **Title:** Investigating Combinatorial Effects of Multiple Loci in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Drosophila Model

    **Research Question:** Do combinatorial effects arising from the contributions of multiple loci contribute to the etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)?

    **Methods:** We employed a Drosophila melanogaster model to examine synaptic and circadian neurological phenotypes resulting from dosage variants of unique human-fly orthologues. We analyzed de novo copy number variants (CNVs) identified in individuals with autism, including a patient carrying a 22q11.2 deletion, and their corresponding Drosophila orthologues.

    **Main Findings:** We observed numerous synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues are jointly affected by large de novo CNVs. Specifically, we found significant synergistic effects following the simultaneous dosage change of gene pairs drawn from a single CNV in three out of four CNVs with complete orthologous relationships. The phenotypic variation observed at the Drosophila synapse supported a concordant phenotypic outcome across all interacting gene pairs following the direction of human gene copy number change.

    **Implications:** Our study provides evidence for the causal role of combinatorial effects arising from the contributions of multiple loci in ASDs. The observed specificity and transitivity between interactors, both within and between CNV candidate gene sets, support shared and distinct genetic aetiologies. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that different interactions affect divergent synaptic processes, highlighting distinct molecular aetiologies.

    **Conclusions:** This study illustrates mechanisms through which synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human disease. The use of Drosophila as an in vivo system allows for the examination of genetic interactions that may contribute to neurological phenotypes like ASD. Our findings suggest that understanding the interactions between genes implicated in autism requires a tractable, high-throughput in vivo system, which is essential for deciphering the complex genetic architecture of ASDs.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Pathogenic Role of Brain-Infiltrating CD8+ T Cells in Experimental Cerebral Malaria

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms through which brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells mediate their pathogenic activity during Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection of C57BL/6 mice, leading to the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM)?

    **Methods:** We employed intravital two-photon microscopy and ex vivo flow cytometric analysis to investigate the behavior and interactions of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in mice infected with both ECM-inducing (P. berghei ANKA) and non-inducing (P. berghei NK65) parasites.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells accumulate within the perivascular spaces of the brains of mice infected with both ECM-inducing and non-inducing parasites. However, perivascular T cells exhibited arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei ANKA infection, characterized by the formation of long-term cognate interactions with CX3CR1-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Notably, abrogation of this interaction by targeted depletion of APCs failed to prevent ECM development. Furthermore, we observed colocalization of pathogenic CD8+ T cells with rare apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection, implying an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic activity of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells during P. berghei ANKA infection. The observed arrested behavior of perivascular T cells and their interactions with APCs suggest a critical role for these interactions in the development of ECM. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of cerebral malaria and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat ECM.
Title: Investigating the Burden of Tungiasis in Vihiga County, Kenya: A Cross-Sectional Study

    Abstract:
    Tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans, is a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. This study aimed to determine the burden of Tungiasis in Vihiga County, Kenya, and explore the associated socio-demographic and environmental factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 21 villages across three sub-locations, involving 437 participants aged 5 years and above. The overall prevalence of Tungiasis was 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7-25.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that low economic status, characterized by a monthly income of ≤ Ksh 1000, was a significant predictor of Tungiasis (adjusted odds ratio 27.85; 95% CI: 4.13-187.59). Other factors associated with Tungiasis included earthen floor, lack of toilet facilities, age ≤14 years, irregular use of closed footwear, and common resting place inside the house. The findings suggest that Tungiasis is a significant health problem in Vihiga County, exacerbated by poverty and poor living conditions. The study highlights the need for cost-effective and accessible control strategies to address this neglected tropical disease. The results also underscore the importance of understanding the geographic distribution and burden of Tungiasis to inform targeted interventions.

    Methods:
    This cross-sectional study was conducted in 21 villages across three sub-locations in Vihiga County, Kenya. A total of 437 participants aged 5 years and above were clinically examined for Tungiasis after providing informed consent. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to assess socio-demographic factors, housing conditions, and knowledge and practices related to Tungiasis. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate regression analysis, and geographic information systems (GIS) was used to map the geographic distribution of Tungiasis.

    Main Findings:
    The overall prevalence of Tungiasis was 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7-25.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that low economic status, characterized by a monthly income of ≤ Ksh 1000, was a significant predictor of Tungiasis (adjusted odds ratio 27.85; 95% CI: 4.13-187.59). Other factors associated with Tungiasis included earthen floor, lack of toilet facilities, age ≤14 years, irregular use of closed footwear, and common resting place inside the house.

    Implications:
    The findings suggest that Tungiasis is a significant health problem in Vihiga County, exacerbated by poverty and poor living conditions. The study highlights the need for cost-effective and accessible control strategies to address this neglected tropical disease. The results also underscore the importance of understanding the geographic distribution and burden of Tungiasis to inform targeted interventions.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides valuable insights into the burden of Tungiasis in Vihiga County, Kenya, and highlights the need for targeted interventions to address this neglected tropical disease. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing poverty and poor living conditions to prevent the spread of Tungiasis. Further research is needed to develop effective control strategies and to understand the geographic distribution and burden of Tungiasis in other regions.

    **Title:** Computational Modeling Reveals the Dynamics of Auxin and Cytokinin Signaling in Arabidopsis Root Development

    **Research Question:** How do auxin and cytokinin signaling interact to regulate the patterning of the Arabidopsis root tip, and what is the role of PIN class auxin efflux transporters and AHP6, an inhibitor of cytokinin signaling, in this process?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model of auxin transport that considers hormonal regulation of auxin transporters within a spatial context, taking into account cell shape, polarity, and the presence of cell walls. We used this model to simulate the dynamics of auxin and cytokinin signaling in the Arabidopsis root tip.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is theoretically unlikely and not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response, rather than variations in cytokinin levels, allow for the necessary feedbacks that amplify and stabilize the auxin maximum. We also found that polar localization of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that stabilizes the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for pattern robustness and reveal a novel role for active auxin influx in this network. We also discovered a connection between subcellular polarity and the emergence of robustness and flexibility at the level of the whole tissue. These insights into the dynamics of transverse auxin transport will play an important role in future attempts to construct three-dimensional models of auxin transport and root growth in Arabidopsis.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational model provides new insights into the complex interactions between auxin and cytokinin signaling in the Arabidopsis root tip. We show that the mutually inhibitory auxin-cytokinin loop is capable of maintaining an auxin maximum in the xylem axis, and that PIN proteins play a crucial role in determining the overall auxin distribution and flux pattern. Our results have important implications for our understanding of root development and patterning, and highlight the need for further research into the dynamics of auxin and cytokinin signaling in plant development.

    **Title:** CREB-B Mediates NPF2-Regulated Locomotor Plasticity in Migratory Locusts

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts, specifically the role of the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway in phase-related locomotor plasticity?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and behavioral assays to investigate the signaling pathway from NPF2 to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. We used genome walking and dual-luciferase assays to characterize the promoter sequence of the NOS gene, and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments to validate the involvement of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity.

    **Main Findings:** We identified CREB-B as a key mediator of the NPF/NO signaling pathway in regulating phase-related locomotor plasticity in migratory locusts. CREB-B directly activates brain NOS expression by interacting with the NOS promoter region, and its phosphorylation at serine 110 site dynamically changes in response to population density variation and is negatively controlled by NPF2. We also found that protein kinase A (PKA) mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts. The identification of CREB-B and PKA as key signal components in the NPF2/NO signaling pathway highlights a precise signal cascade underlying phase-related locomotor plasticity. Our results also suggest that the NPY/PKA/CREB-B signaling cascade may represent a common mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity in animals.

    **Conclusions:** This study extends our previous findings by uncovering two key signal components, CREB-B and PKA, in the NPF2/NO signaling pathway involved in the regulation of phase-related locomotor plasticity. Our findings present a previously undefined regulatory mechanism on NOS transcription in insects and shed light on how neuromodulator/TF/effect gene networks contribute to environment-induced behavioral plasticity.

    **Title:** Zelda Plays a Central Role in Regulating Genome Activity at the Maternal-to-Zygotic Transition in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) in regulating genome activity at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila?

    **Methods:** We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD in Drosophila embryos at three timepoints: mitotic cycle 8 (before MZT), mitotic cycle 13 (during MZT), and late mitotic cycle 14 (after MZT).

    **Main Findings:** We identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. Early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage, but we also observed ZLD bound to the promoters of genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT. Notably, ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ZLD plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT, in addition to its established role in regulating early transcriptional activation. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is strong, indicating that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a central role in regulating genome activity at the MZT.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ZLD activation and its role in regulating genome activity at the MZT in Drosophila. Our results highlight the importance of ZLD in activating the genome at the MZT, and suggest that ZLD binding can be used as a marker for identifying active promoters and regulatory sequences. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of early embryonic development and the regulation of gene expression in metazoans.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of Circadian Protein-Protein Interactions: A Systems-Wide View

    **Research Question:** What are the novel protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among circadian clock proteins, and how do these interactions contribute to the temporal organization of cellular physiology?

    **Methods:** We employed a yeast-two-hybrid approach to identify 109 novel PPIs among circadian clock proteins. We also constructed a dynamic circadian PPI network using circadian expression data and performed systematic circadian phenotyping via RNAi and overexpression.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the interaction of protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1 resulted in BMAL1 destabilization. We also identified modulators of CLOCK/BMAL1 function, indicating a role for protein phosphatase 1 in the dynamic regulation of BMAL1 abundance. Furthermore, our systems analysis of a global dynamic network in liver revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting regulatory interactions to specific phases.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that circadian PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle, contributing to the temporal organization of cellular physiology. The precise timing of PPIs is essential for sustaining circadian rhythms with normal dynamics.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a systems-wide view of circadian PPI dynamics, revealing novel interactions among circadian clock proteins. Our results highlight the importance of precisely timed PPIs for the circadian clockwork and underscore the need for further investigation into the regulation of circadian output processes via time-of-day dependent PPIs. The identification of modulators of CLOCK/BMAL1 function and the construction of a dynamic circadian PPI network will facilitate a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and their impact on cellular physiology.

    **Title:** Structural Characterization of ABA-1A, a Novel Lipid-Binding Protein from Ascaris suum Nematode Polyprotein Allergens

    **Research Question:** What is the solution structure of ABA-1A, the most common repeating unit of the Nematode Polyprotein Allergens (NPAs) from Ascaris suum, and how do its binding sites interact with hydrophobic ligands?

    **Methods:** The solution structure of ABA-1A was determined by protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Recombinant ABA-1A was expressed and purified, and its binding sites were characterized using NMR spectroscopy.

    **Main Findings:** ABA-1A adopts a novel seven-helical fold, comprising a long central helix that participates in two hollow four-helical bundles on either side. Discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and the amino acid sidechains affected by ligand binding were identified. Recombinant ABA-1A contains tightly-bound ligand(s) of bacterial culture origin in one of its binding sites.

    **Implications:** The structure of ABA-1A provides insights into the function of NPAs in nematode parasites, which are renowned for their immunodominance and propensity to be allergens. NPAs may play key roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody-based responses in infection. The structure of ABA-1A also suggests that sequestration or delivery of pharmacologically active lipids may be a mechanism by which parasites can subvert the host immune response.

    **Conclusions:** ABA-1A is the first mature, post-translationally processed, unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly-repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source, and it belongs to a new structural class. NPAs have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. The nature of the unidentified bacterial ligand(s) may be pertinent to this, as will our characterization of the unusual binding sites. This study contributes to the elucidation of the structure-function relationships of NPAs and their role in nematode infections.

    **Title:** Rising Incidence of Ciguatera Poisoning in Pacific Island Countries and Territories: A Growing Public Health Concern

    **Research Question:** What is the extent of ciguatera poisoning in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) and how has it changed over time?

    **Methods:** A questionnaire was sent to Health and Fisheries Authorities of 17 PICTs to collect data on reported cases of ciguatera poisoning from 1998-2008. The data were analyzed using t-test, incidence rate ratios, ranked correlation, and regression analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a significant increase in the annual incidence of ciguatera poisoning in PICTs, with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people from 1998-2008, compared to 104 cases per 100,000 people from 1973-1983. This represents a 60% increase in the annual incidence of ciguatera between the two time periods. Taking into account under-reporting, we estimate that approximately 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from ciguatera poisoning over the last 35 years.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ciguatera poisoning is a major public health concern in PICTs, with significant implications for the health and well-being of island communities. The increasing incidence of ciguatera poisoning is likely due to a combination of factors, including climate change, coastal development, and increased exploitation of coastal marine resources.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the need for well-funded multidisciplinary research teams to address the significant public health problem of ciguatera poisoning in PICTs. The development of practical management solutions is essential to mitigate the impact of ciguatera poisoning on human health and ecosystem health. Our findings also underscore the need for improved surveillance and reporting of ciguatera cases, as well as the development of diagnostic tools to detect ciguatoxin in fish and humans. Ultimately, our study emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of ciguatera poisoning, including climate change, coastal degradation, and overfishing, to protect the health and well-being of Pacific island communities.

    Title: Reversal of CD4+CD8+ T Cell Exhaustion by Benznidazole Treatment in Chronic Chagas Disease

    Background: Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is characterized by the persistence of the parasite and impairment of the cellular immune response. The CD4+CD8+ T cell population has been reported to expand in chronic Chagas disease patients, but the impact of antiparasitic treatment on this subset of cells is poorly understood.

    Methods: This study enrolled 38 chronic Chagas disease patients (20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic) and 12 healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T. cruzi antigens to analyze the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4+CD8+ T cells before and after benznidazole treatment. Expression and co-expression of five inhibitory receptors in these patients after treatment were studied using multiparameter flow cytometry.

    Main Findings: The frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was higher in chronic Chagas disease patients compared to healthy donors. Benznidazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. The co-expression level of inhibitory receptors was reduced after treatment, simultaneously with the enhancement of the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells. After treatment, an increase in the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α was observed.

    Implications: These findings suggest that CD4+CD8+ T cells could play an important role in the control of T. cruzi infection. Benznidazole treatment partially reversed the exhaustion process caused by T. cruzi infection in these cells, with an improvement in the functional response of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the role of CD4+CD8+ T cells in the immune response against T. cruzi infection during the chronic phase of Chagas disease. Benznidazole treatment improves the quality of antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cell responses and partially reverses the exhaustion process of these cells. These results add to our knowledge concerning the immune response against T. cruzi infection and potentially provide a tool to analyze the efficacy of benznidazole treatment in patients with chronic Chagas disease.
Title: Identification of Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) as a Key Regulator of Seedling Growth and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Arabidopsis thaliana

    Abstract:

    Background: Phosphoinositides play crucial roles in plant development and stress response, but the specific enzymes involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and their functions remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana?

    Methods: We isolated and analyzed knockout mutants of multiple AtPLC isoforms in Arabidopsis and performed lipidomic profiling of phosphoinositides to identify the primary phospholipase involved in phosphoinositide metabolism.

    Main Findings: Our results show that AtPLC2 is the primary phospholipase in phosphoinositide metabolism and is involved in seedling growth and ER stress responses in Arabidopsis. Lipidomic profiling of multiple plc mutants revealed that the plc2-1 mutant increased levels of its substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, suggesting that the major phosphoinositide metabolic pathway is impaired. AtPLC2 displayed a distinct tissue expression pattern and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types, where phosphoinositide signaling occurs. The seedlings of plc2-1 mutant showed growth defects that were complemented by heterologous expression of AtPLC2, suggesting that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity borne by AtPLC2 is required for seedling growth. Moreover, the plc2-1 mutant showed hypersensitive response to ER stress as evidenced by changes in relevant phenotypes and gene expression profiles.

    Implications: Our findings reveal the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth, and an emerging link between phosphoinositide and the ER stress response. This study highlights the importance of phosphoinositide signaling in plant growth and development and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ER stress response in plants.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that AtPLC2 is the major PI-PLC involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and seedling growth in Arabidopsis. Moreover, it is essential for ER stress tolerance, suggesting a link between phosphoinositide signaling and the ER stress response. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of phosphoinositide metabolism and its role in plant development and stress response.

    **Title:** Challenging Reductionism: Emergence of Macro-Level Causation in Complex Systems

    **Research Question:** Can the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs exclusively at the micro level be challenged by demonstrating the emergence of macro-level causation?

    **Methods:** We employed a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power (Φ) to evaluate the causal power of simple systems across different spatial and temporal scales. We systematically considered all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. We demonstrate that a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). Furthermore, we identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales, which correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus.

    **Implications:** Our findings refute the reductionist assumption that causal power resides exclusively at the micro level. By evaluating cause-effect power of black-box systems across many spatiotemporal scales, we show that there can be several local maxima of macro cause-effect power, between which integrated information decreases or falls to zero. These local maxima capture emergent functional roles of black-box macro elements, corresponding to different descriptions of the system as sets of NOR, OR/AND, or MAJORITY elements.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a theoretical framework to evaluate cause-effect power and the cause-effect properties of black-box systems. We demonstrate that emergent cause-effect properties may include an increase in the overall intrinsic cause-effect power of the system, as well as specific relationships between elements within the system (mechanisms) that only become apparent at the macro level. Our results have significant implications for our understanding of complex systems, including biological systems, and highlight the importance of considering macro-level causation in addition to micro-level causation.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanisms of Reactive Oxygen Species Production in the Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain: A Rule-Based Modeling Approach

    Abstract:
    Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are crucial signaling molecules that modulate cellular adaptation to environmental changes, yet they also contribute to cellular damage under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation, relevant to various systemic diseases and transplantation. To investigate the mechanisms and determinants of ROS production, we extended our rule-based model of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) to account for electron transport, proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential generation, TCA cycle reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. Our model was validated by fitting respiratory electron fluxes measured in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, as well as the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I.

    Our analysis revealed an association between ROS production and levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III. Notably, we found that the phenomenon of bistability, previously observed in complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted based on theoretical analysis and confirmed experimentally. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC.

    Our model describes various states of respiratory complexes formed during electron transport, including those containing free radicals, which can pass unpaired electrons to oxygen, forming superoxide radicals and other forms of ROS. By comparing measured ROS production and the levels of various free radicals predicted by the model, we clarified the contributions of different radicals to ROS production. The inhibition of reverse electron transport by rotenone decreased ROS production in succinate-fueled brain mitochondria, validating our model. Our results suggest that the model provides a valid insight into the mechanism of respiration and ROS production, even without precise evaluation of the model parameters. These findings have significant implications for understanding the role of ROS in cellular adaptation and disease, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to modulate ROS production in mitochondria.

    **Title:** Emergent Transport Behaviors in Heterogeneous Motor Protein Ensembles: A Semi-Analytic Approach

    **Research Question:** How do mutations in motor proteins affect the transport of intracellular cargo in the presence of wild-type motors, and what are the emergent transport behaviors exhibited by heterogeneous motor protein ensembles?

    **Methods:** We developed a semi-analytic method to analyze the transport of cargo by multiple motor proteins with distinct properties. This technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo, enabling the computation of biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces can gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant’s stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force. Furthermore, we show that mutants can determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how mutant motors impact intracellular transport and contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. The developed semi-analytic method can be used to introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation and deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals surprising emergent transport behaviors arising when a cargo is transported by multiple motor proteins, some of which are mutated and some are not. The developed semi-analytic method provides a powerful tool for analyzing the transport of cargo by heterogeneous motor protein ensembles, enabling the computation of biologically relevant quantities without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. This approach can be used to study the impact of mutations on intracellular transport and inform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

    **Title:** Selective Ablation of the Cacna1c Gene Modulates Learning Strategies in Mice

    **Research Question:** How does a selective functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene, associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders, modulate the learning process in mice?

    **Methods:** We employed a detailed, individual-level analysis of learning on an operant cue discrimination task in mice with a selective knockout (KO) of the Cacna1c gene (Cav1.2NesCre) and matched controls with intact gene expression (Cav1.2fl/fl). The task consisted of three phases, requiring animals to perform a nose poke response on one side of a touchscreen box based on the position of a light square on the screen.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a Cacna1c knockout does not impair learning in general but has a specific effect on learning strategies. The majority of Cacna1c knockout mice still managed to increase reward feedback across trials, but did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy, whereas the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that the Cacna1c gene plays a specific role in learning and highlight the importance of examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The results may also have clinical implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with altered Cacna1c gene expression.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a genetic variation can determine an animal's learning strategy and associated performance patterns. By examining the detailed pattern of behavioral responses and rewards received across the learning process, combined with analyses based on behavioral (reinforcement) learning models, we provide mechanistic insight into the role of the Cacna1c gene in learning. These findings have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Title: Temperature-Dependent Effects on Wolbachia Infections in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes: Implications for Arbovirus Suppression

Background: Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are being released worldwide to suppress arbovirus transmission. However, their potential to invade and persist in populations depends on interactions with environmental conditions, particularly temperature fluctuations.

Research Question: How do different Wolbachia infections (wMel, wAlbB, and wMelPop-CLA) in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes respond to diurnal cyclical temperatures, and what are the implications for arbovirus suppression?

Methods: We reared Aedes aegypti larvae infected with wMel, wAlbB, and wMelPop-CLA under diurnal cyclical temperatures (26-37°C) and assessed the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, Wolbachia density, and maternal transmission fidelity.

Main Findings: We found that wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections exhibited reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility and Wolbachia density when reared at 26-37°C. Furthermore, these infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to this temperature cycle across all life stages. In contrast, the wAlbB infection was maintained at a high density, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under the same temperature conditions.

Implications: These findings have significant implications for the potential success of Wolbachia interventions across different environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing. The reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility and Wolbachia density in wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections at high temperatures may compromise their ability to suppress arbovirus transmission.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that temperature-dependent effects on Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have important implications for arbovirus suppression. The results suggest that wAlbB infection may be more suitable for Wolbachia-based interventions in environments with high temperatures, while wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections may require temperature-controlled rearing conditions to maintain their efficacy. These findings emphasize the need for further research on the effects of temperature on Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti and highlight the importance of considering environmental conditions in the development of Wolbachia-based arbovirus suppression strategies.
Title: Asymptomatic Shedding of Adenoviruses in Non-Human Primates: Implications for Zoonotic Transmission and Gene Therapy

    Abstract:
    We investigated the natural history of adenovirus infections in non-human primates, including great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) and macaques. Our research aimed to understand the prevalence and characteristics of adenovirus shedding in asymptomatic hosts and its implications for zoonotic transmission and gene therapy. We collected stool samples from 568 non-human primates from zoos and primate facilities and detected adenoviruses in 18% of the samples using a cytopathic effect (CPE) detection assay. Shedding was observed at similar frequencies (22-38%) among chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. In contrast, shedding in asymptomatic humans was much less frequent, comparable to previous reports. We purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ape adenoviruses could be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E, with evidence of intraspecies recombination and cross-species transmission events. Our findings suggest that adenoviruses are capable of establishing chronic infections following an initial exposure, which may or may not be clinically relevant. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling and housing. Furthermore, the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the natural history of adenovirus infections in non-human primates and highlights the need for caution in primate handling and housing. The presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Nucleosomal DNA Unwrapping: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study

    **Research Question:** What is the free energy profile for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA, and what are the conformational states involved in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method, specifically the adaptively biased molecular dynamics (ABMD) method combined with the multiple walker method, to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed a free energy change of approximately 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn, which is consistent with values obtained in single-molecule experiments. We observed a variety of conformational states, indicating multiple potential paths to outer superhelical turn unwrapping. Notably, the dominant path is likely asymmetric, with the first five base pairs unwrapping at one end of the DNA, followed by a second five base pairs unwrapping at the same end without an increase in free energy. The unwrapping then proceeds at the other end of the DNA, where 10 base pairs are unwrapped, followed by further unwrapping of 15 base pairs.

    **Implications:** These findings provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes. Understanding the mechanism of nucleosomal DNA unwrapping is crucial for elucidating the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling.

    **Conclusions:** Our molecular dynamics simulation study provides a detailed description of the free energy profiles and conformational states involved in the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. The results suggest that the unwrapping process is complex and involves multiple potential paths, with the dominant path being asymmetric. These findings contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of chromatin and have implications for the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. Future studies will investigate the role of histone tails in the unwrapping process.

    **Title:** Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) Regulates Lysosomal pH Homeostasis and Membrane Integrity in Response to Oxidative Stress

    **Research Question:** What is the cellular mechanism by which Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) exerts its neuroprotective effects in response to oxidative stress?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of single-lysosome in vivo pH measurements and immunodetection to investigate the subcellular traffic and function of ApoD in astrocytes and neurons under oxidative stress conditions induced by paraquat.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. We show that ApoD is functionally stable in the acidic environment of lysosomes and is sufficient and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization. Furthermore, we found that ApoD prevents lysosomal membrane permeabilization, which is critical for maintaining lysosomal pH gradients. Our analysis reveals ApoD as a specific marker for the subpopulation of lysosomes vulnerable to oxidation.

    **Implications:** These findings uncover a previously unknown biological function of ApoD, a member of the finely regulated and evolutionarily conserved gene family of extracellular Lipocalins. Our results suggest that ApoD plays a crucial role in maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity and pH homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular functions, including myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the cellular mechanism by which ApoD exerts its neuroprotective effects in response to oxidative stress. We propose a lipoprotein-mediated regulation of lysosomal membrane integrity as a new mechanism at the hub of many cellular functions, critical for the outcome of a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases. These results open therapeutic opportunities by providing a route of entry and a repair mechanism for lysosomes in pathological situations.

    Title: Comparative Life Cycle Parameters and Susceptibility to Leishmania donovani of Phlebotomus orientalis Colonies from Endemic and Non-Endemic Sites in Ethiopia

    Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania donovani, is a significant public health concern in East Africa. Phlebotomus orientalis is the primary vector of VL in the region. We investigated the life cycle parameters and susceptibility to L. donovani of two P. orientalis colonies from different sites in Ethiopia: Melka Werer (MW), a non-endemic site in the lowlands, and Addis Zemen (AZ), an endemic focus of human VL in the highlands.

    Methods: We compared the life cycle parameters of the two colonies, including larval food and humidity requirements during pupation, using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI mitochondrial genes. We also studied the susceptibility of P. orientalis to L. donovani by experimental infections using different infective doses.

    Main Findings: Our results showed marked differences in life-cycle parameters between the two colonies, including distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analysis using RAPD PCR and DNA sequencing did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies. F1 hybrids developed successfully with higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Both MW and AZ colonies of P. orientalis were highly susceptible to L. donovani, with infection rates of around 90% using higher infective doses. The development of L. donovani in P. orientalis was fast, with the presence of metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and the colonization of the stomodeal valve by haptomonads recorded in most P. orientalis females by day five post-blood feeding.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in non-endemic area Melka Werer cannot be attributed to different susceptibility of local P. orientalis populations to L. donovani. The susceptibility of P. orientalis to L. donovani is a crucial factor in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis. Our study highlights the importance of optimizing sand fly rearing conditions individually for each colony and provides the first detailed description of L. donovani development in P. orientalis under laboratory conditions.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that P. orientalis is a highly susceptible vector of L. donovani, and only very low parasite doses are needed for establishment of experimental infections in this sand fly species. These findings have significant implications for the control and prevention of visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa.
Title: Estimating the Quality of Life and Disability Weight of Advanced Schistosomiasis Japonica: A Patient-Based Evaluation in a Schistosoma japonicum-Hyperendemic County of the People’s Republic of China

    Abstract:

    Background: Schistosomiasis japonica is a significant public health concern in the People’s Republic of China, yet its burden has not been accurately estimated in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life and disability weight (DW) of advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a schistosoma japonicum-hyperendemic county.

    Methods: A patient-based evaluation was conducted in a schistosoma japonicum-hyperendemic county of the People’s Republic of China. Suspected or officially registered advanced cases of schistosomiasis japonica were screened using a short questionnaire and physical examination. Disability and morbidity were assessed in confirmed cases using the European Quality of Life Questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension (EQ-5D plus), ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. The age-specific DW of advanced schistosomiasis japonica was estimated based on patients’ self-rated health scores on the visual analogue scale of the questionnaire.

    Main Findings: Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were confirmed as advanced schistosomiasis japonica and evaluated. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, including pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety or depression (80.9%). The overall DW was 0.447, and age-specific DWs ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. DWs were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life.

    Implications: These patient-preference disability estimates could provide updated data for a revision of the GBD, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in the People’s Republic of China’s national schistosomiasis control program.

    Conclusions: Advanced schistosomiasis japonica is associated with poor self-reported quality of life, high morbidity, and heavy disability. The overall DW of advanced schistosomiasis japonica is 0.447, indicating a significant burden of disease. These findings highlight the importance of considering the quality of life and disability weight of advanced schistosomiasis japonica in the re-estimation of the burden of disease due to schistosomiasis.

    Title: Estimating Population Vulnerability and Disability in Tsetse-Infested Areas of Kenya: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study

    Background: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, and African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also referred to as nagana, are vector-borne diseases prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. These diseases are caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei (T. b.) spp., transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tsetse fly.

    Research Question: Can national census data be used to estimate population vulnerability and disability in tsetse-infested areas of Kenya, and what are the implications for HAT surveillance programs?

    Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized 1999 national census data to examine the relationship between tsetse fly habitats and disability prevalence in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts. A multilevel study design estimated the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty. The study focused on residents and recent migrants of working age.

    Main Findings: The study identified tsetse belts significantly associated with increased disability prevalence and evaluated the direct and indirect exposure pathways of tsetse fly impact on disability. The results suggest that the combined burdens of HAT and AAT, as well as the opportunity costs of agricultural production in AAT areas, contribute to disability within tsetse-infested areas.

    Implications: Incorporating reports on disability from national census data is a promising surveillance tool that may enhance future HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. The study highlights the need for alternative surveillance approaches in areas with limited public health infrastructure.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of using national census data to estimate population vulnerability and disability in tsetse-infested areas of Kenya. The findings have implications for HAT surveillance programs and suggest that the combined burdens of HAT and AAT, as well as the opportunity costs of agricultural production, contribute to disability within tsetse-infested areas. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability following the release of the Kenya 2009 census at the local level.

    **Title:** Hexamethylene Bisacetamide (HMBA) Induces HIV Production by Transiently Activating the PI3K/Akt Pathway and Releasing P-TEFb from HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA

    **Background:** Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** How does HMBA induce HIV production in chronically infected cells?

    **Methods:** We investigated the mechanism of HMBA-induced HIV production in chronically infected cells using a combination of biochemical and molecular biology approaches, including Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq).

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that HMBA transiently activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the subsequent release of active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA). The released P-TEFb is then recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription elongation and viral production. Importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the expression of a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonize this HMBA-mediated induction of viral production.

    **Implications:** Our studies reveal a novel mechanism by which HMBA targets the pivotal cellular co-factor P-TEFb for the reactivation of HIV production in chronically infected cells. These findings suggest that modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation and HIV production.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our studies demonstrate that HMBA induces HIV production in chronically infected cells by transiently activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and releasing P-TEFb from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HMBA-induced HIV production and highlight the potential of HMBA as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HIV infection.

    **Title:** Development of a Novel Diagnostic Tool for Detecting Leishmania RNA Virus (LRV) in Leishmaniasis Patients

    **Background:** Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by New World Leishmania (Viannia) species is a significant public health concern, with a high risk of developing mucosal (ML) or disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The presence of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) in L. guyanensis strains has been linked to elevated parasitaemia, destructive hyper-inflammation, and disease exacerbation.

    **Research Question:** Can a novel anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody (J2) be used to detect LRV in Leishmania strains and patient samples, providing a diagnostic tool for predicting LRV-related risk of complications in CL?

    **Methods:** We evaluated various techniques for LRV detection, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, dot blot, nucleic acid purification, and quantitative real-time PCR. The J2 antibody was used to detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in a sequence-independent fashion.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity of the J2 antibody in detecting LRV in several Leishmania strains, a freshly isolated patient sample, and murine lesion biopsies. The J2 antibody-based methods were found to be easy to use and suitable for field application.

    **Implications:** LRV detection using the J2 antibody has the potential to become a diagnostic tool for predicting LRV-related risk of complications in CL. This could lead to improved patient management and treatment outcomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a novel approach for LRV detection in Leishmania strains and patient samples. The J2 antibody-based methods offer a promising diagnostic tool for predicting LRV-related risk of complications in CL. Further refinements of these methods could be transferred to the field for use in detecting LRV and assessing LRV-related risk in CL patients.

    **Title:** Comparative Analysis of Enteropathogenic and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) Colonization Properties in Polarized Epithelial Cells

    **Research Question:** What are the distinct colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells, and how do the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir and the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU contribute to bacterial colonization?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC in polarized epithelial cells. We used KC12 and KC12Δtir strains harboring EspFU-myc or control plasmids to infect Caco-2 monolayers, allowing us to assess the individual and combined contributions of Tir and EspFU to colonization.

    **Main Findings:** We found that both EPEC and EHEC formed distinct bacterial communities, or "macrocolonies," that encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. Notably, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell.

    **Implications:** Our data reveal that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission. These findings suggest that the EHEC mechanism of pedestal assembly provides a colonization advantage over the EPEC pathway of actin polymerization in infections of polarized intestinal epithelia.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC in polarized epithelial cells, highlighting the distinct roles of Tir and EspFU in promoting bacterial motility and cell-to-cell transmission. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of EPEC and EHEC infections and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat these diseases.

    **Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Differential Centrifugation and Size Exclusion Chromatography for the Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles from Fasciola hepatica

    **Research Question:** What is the most effective method for isolating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the excretory-secretory products of Fasciola hepatica, a pathogenic helminth?

    **Methods:** EVs were isolated from culture media of F. hepatica using either differential centrifugation (DC) or size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy, protein quantification, Western blotting, and proteomic analysis were used to evaluate the purity and composition of the isolated EVs.

    **Main Findings:** SEC-purified EVs were found to be smaller in size and less diverse than DC-purified EVs. Protein quantification and Western blotting revealed a higher EV purity to free excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield ratio in SEC-purified EVs compared to DC-purified EVs. Proteomic analysis showed that DC-purified EVs contained a higher diversity of protein identifications and unique peptide hits, indicating contamination from ESP and tegumental components. Additionally, SEC-purified EVs contained fewer tegumental-based proteins.

    **Implications:** The results suggest that DC and SEC purification methods do not isolate equivalent EV population profiles, and caution should be taken in the choice of EV purification method used. The study highlights the importance of using SEC methods for EV purification prior to downstream studies, as they result in a higher EV purity to protein yield ratio and reduced contamination from ESP and tegumental components.

    **Conclusions:** This study challenges the current standard procedure for helminth pathogen EV analysis, differential centrifugation, and suggests that size exclusion chromatography is a more effective method for isolating EVs from F. hepatica. The findings have significant implications for the development of reliable protocols for EV isolation and downstream studies, particularly in the context of host-pathogen communication and the role of EVs in promoting or inhibiting host immunity. Therefore, SEC methods with functional assays are proposed as the methodology of choice for helminth pathogen EV studies and application development.
Title: Reverse-Engineering Post-Transcriptional Regulation in Drosophila Melanogaster: A Quantitative Analysis of Gap Gene Expression

    Abstract:

    Background: Systems biology relies on iterative cycles of experiment and modeling to elucidate complex biological processes. Reverse engineering, a key component of this approach, involves fitting models to data to infer and analyze regulatory mechanisms. However, rigorous methods are required to determine whether model parameters can be properly identified, especially in complex biological contexts.

    Research Question: Can post-transcriptional regulation be inferred as necessary for patterning in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster, specifically for the expression of the gap genes Krüppel, knirps, and giant?

    Methods: We employed a reverse-engineering approach, using detailed, quantitative datasets of gap gene mRNA and protein expression to solve and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation. We established the structural and practical identifiability of the model, ensuring that the fitting procedure had a unique solution.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. The fitted models and parameter estimates were robust and specific, yielding biologically plausible values for rate parameters.

    Implications: This study highlights the potential of reverse engineering for the study of complex biological processes, such as development and pattern formation. By rigorously determining the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model, we can increase the confidence in our understanding of biological mechanisms.

    Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in controlling protein levels, but is not essential for patterning in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. The reverse-engineering approach used in this study provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex biological systems, allowing for the identification of regulatory mechanisms and the determination of model parameters. This approach has significant implications for the study of development and other complex biological processes.

    Title: Age-Dependent Mechanisms of Intestinal Epithelial Innate Immune Response to Rotavirus Infection

    Background: Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide, exhibiting a pronounced small intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) tropism. Human infants and neonatal mice are highly susceptible, whereas adult individuals remain asymptomatic and shed only low numbers of viral particles.

    Research Question: What are the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial innate immune response to rotavirus infection in an oral mouse infection model?

    Methods: We investigated the expression of the innate immune receptor for viral dsRNA, Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3), in the epithelium of suckling and adult mice. We also examined the role of Tlr3 and its adaptor molecule Trif in the antiviral host response using Tlr3−/− and TrifLps2/Lps2 mice.

    Main Findings: We found that Tlr3 expression was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in Tlr3 or Trif exhibited significantly higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in Tlr3 or Trif did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility.

    Implications: Our results suggest that upregulation of epithelial TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. We also found that Tlr3-Trif mediated innate immune signaling significantly influenced epithelial cytokine and chemokine expression, antiviral effector cell recruitment, and viral shedding in adult but not neonate mice.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies the postnatal increase in the intestinal epithelial expression of Tlr3 as a key factor determining the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of rotavirus infection and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat rotavirus disease in young infants.

    **Title:** Whole-Exome Sequencing of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Implications for Gene Discovery and Rare Variant Analysis

    **Research Question:** Can whole-exome sequencing (WES) identify new risk genes for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in a large sample of cases and controls, and what are the implications for gene discovery and rare variant analysis?

    **Methods:** We conducted WES on 1,039 subjects diagnosed with ASD and 870 controls of similar ancestry from the NIMH repository. Data were generated by two centers using different methods for sequence production and variant calling. We evaluated the distribution of rare variation across centers and explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the distribution of rare variation was similar across centers after filtering called variants by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative to reference reads. Gene-based analyses of association showed that mega-analysis had better power than meta-analysis. We also found that population structure can confound case-control studies by clustering rare variants in ancestry space, but principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions. Despite using a variety of gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, we found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that standard gene-based tests will require much larger samples of cases and controls before being effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD. This has significant implications for the design of future exome sequencing studies and the interpretation of results.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis and the need for larger sample sizes to identify new risk genes for complex disorders like ASD. While our results did not identify new risk genes for ASD, they provide valuable insights into the challenges and limitations of gene discovery using WES and highlight the need for more powerful statistical methods and larger sample sizes to uncover the genetic architecture of ASD.
Title: Investigating the Role of Chitinase Activity in the Development of Eumycetoma Caused by Madurella mycetomatis in a Sudanese Population

    Abstract:
    Background: Madurella mycetomatis is the most prevalent causative agent of eumycetoma in Sudan, an infection characterized by the formation of grains. Despite exposure to the causative agent, only a small number of individuals develop infection. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in the genes encoding for chitin-degrading enzymes, chitotriosidase and AMCase, and the incidence of M. mycetomatis mycetoma in a Sudanese population.

    Methods: We genotyped 112 eumycetoma patients and 103 matched controls for four polymorphisms: a 24-bp insertion in the chitotriosidase gene (rs3831317), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AMCase gene (rs61756687), a SNP (rs41282492), and a 10-bp insertion in the 5’UTR region of the AMCase gene (rs143789088). DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain.

    Main Findings: The polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity (rs3831317) was associated with increased odds of eumycetoma (odds ratio 2.9; p = 0.004). No association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase (all p > 0.05).

    Implications: Our findings suggest that decreased chitotriosidase activity is associated with an increased risk of M. mycetomatis mycetoma. This is the first study to investigate the role of chitinase activity in the development of eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis.

    Conclusions: The results of this study provide new insights into the genetic predisposition to eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis. The association between decreased chitotriosidase activity and increased risk of M. mycetomatis mycetoma highlights the importance of chitinase activity in the human immune response to fungal infections. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of eumycetoma.

    **Title:** Challenging the Paradigm of Herpes Simplex Virus Latency: Direct Evidence of Lytic Gene Expression during Latency

    **Research Question:** Do lytic and latent phases of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection exist as distinct, well-defined states, or is there evidence of lytic gene expression during latency?

    **Methods:** We employed a highly sensitive Cre-marking model to investigate the dynamics of HSV-1 infection in the nervous system. This model allowed us to track the expression of lytic and latent genes in real-time.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to the traditional view of HSV latency, our results show that lytic and latent phases are not as clearly defined as previously thought. Firstly, we found that around half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred beyond the initial acute infection. Secondly, we provide direct evidence that lytic promoters can drive protein expression during latency, indicating that lytic gene expression is not restricted to the acute phase of infection.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of HSV latency and its relationship with adaptive immunity. Our results suggest that lytic gene expression may be an integral part of latency, or that the early presentation of viral proteins to CD8+ T cells may provide an opportunity for reactivation to be halted at an early stage by an immune mechanism.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the most direct evidence to date that HSV-1 lytic promoters are capable of generating protein during latency establishment and maintenance. These findings challenge the traditional view of HSV latency and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between viral gene expression and adaptive immunity during all phases of HSV-1 infection. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between adaptive immunity and viral gene expression during HSV-1 infection.

    **Title:** Strain-Specific Prion Protein Accumulation and Neuroinflammation in Scrapie-Infected Mice

    **Background:** Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases, are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of host proteins. In prion diseases, the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) accumulates in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS).

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the cell specificity of PrPSc accumulation at early preclinical times post-infection using three mouse scrapie strains that differ in brain regional pathology.

    **Methods:** Dual-staining immunohistochemistry was used to compare the cell specificity of PrPSc accumulation in mice infected with strains 22L, ME7, and RML. Additionally, the expression of 90 genes involved in neuroinflammation was studied quantitatively using mRNA from thalamus at preclinical times.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed that PrPSc from each strain had a different pattern of cell specificity. Strain 22L was mainly associated with astroglia, whereas strain ME7 was mainly associated with neurons and neuropil. Strain RML showed a mixed pattern, similar to 22L in thalamus and cortex, but similar to ME7 in substantia nigra. Despite the cellular differences in PrPSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains, and the small differences observed correlated with variations in the early disease tempo. Gene upregulation correlated with activation of both astroglia and microglia detected in early disease prior to vacuolar pathology or clinical signs.

    **Implications:** The findings suggest that prion strain-specific PrPSc deposition is not correlated with the neuroinflammatory response seen during scrapie infection. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed markedly from that seen in two acute viral CNS diseases, LaCrosse virus and BE polytropic Friend retrovirus, which had reactive gliosis at levels similar to our prion-infected mice.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the cell specificity of PrPSc accumulation and neuroinflammation in scrapie-infected mice. The results have implications for the development of common strategies of therapeutic intervention against the seeded polymerization events in prion diseases.

    **Title:** Coarse-Grained Modeling of Chromosome Organization: A Generic Strategy for Investigating Chromatin Dynamics

    **Research Question:** How can we develop efficient coarse-grained models to investigate the multi-spatio-temporal scales of chromosomes, which are long and densely packed, topologically constrained polymers?

    **Methods:** We proposed a generic strategy to develop coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for polymer entanglement length and volumic density. Our simulation scheme captures steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system and tracks dynamics at different coarse-graining levels, offering a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency.

    **Main Findings:** Using our formalism, we investigated the time evolution of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in Drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We showed that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicts that chromatin motion is highly dynamic during the cell cycle.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the necessity to adequately account for the time evolution of chromosome organization in quantitative models, especially for higher eukaryotes where chromosomes are strongly topologically constrained. Our coarse-graining approach offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and can be applied to any self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrated the utility of our coarse-graining approach to study chromatin organization in Drosophila and showed that neglecting topological constraints may lead to an erroneous description of fine-scale models. Our strategy provides a powerful tool for investigating the complex dynamics of chromosomes and chromatin biology, enabling the simulation of chromosome dynamics during the whole cell cycle on a desktop computer within a day. This work has significant implications for understanding the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding and gene expression regulation.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Cell Type Specificity of Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) through Integrative Genomic Analysis

    **Research Question:** How do genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription, and can we predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs using integrative genomic analysis?

    **Methods:** We performed an eQTL analysis in three parts: (1) identifying eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types, (2) integrating eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project, and (3) building a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs.

    **Main Findings:** We found that eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type-specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell-specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. This integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study addresses the need for an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs. By integrating eQTL data with CRE data, we provide a framework for predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs and annotating GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data. This work has significant implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation and has the potential to improve the interpretation of GWAS results.

    **Title:** Development of a CRISPR-Cas9 Engineered CHO Cell Line for the Production of HIV-1 Vaccine Immunogens with Glycan-Dependent Epitopes

    **Research Question:** Can a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system be used to create a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, enabling the production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens with glycan-dependent epitopes?

    **Methods:** We employed the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to inactivate the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1) in a CHO cell line, resulting in a stable suspension-adapted cell line that limits glycosylation to Man5 and earlier intermediates.

    **Main Findings:** Monomeric gp120s produced in the MGAT1− CHO cell line exhibited improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) directed to the V1/V2 domain (e.g., PG9) and the V3 stem (e.g., PGT128 and 10-1074), while preserving the structure of the important glycan-independent epitopes (e.g., VRC01).

    **Implications:** The development of this MGAT1− CHO cell line has significant implications for the production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. The ability to limit glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway without impairing cell growth or productivity suggests that this cell line will be a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to create a CHO cell line that can produce HIV-1 vaccine immunogens with glycan-dependent epitopes. This achievement addresses a major challenge in HIV vaccine research and has the potential to accelerate the development of effective HIV vaccines that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. The MGAT1− CHO cell line provides a valuable tool for the production of glycan-optimized gp120 vaccine immunogens, which are critical for eliciting bN-mAbs to glycan-dependent epitopes.
Title: Crystal Structure of Trehalose-6-Phosphate Phosphatase from Brugia malayi and Implications for Anthelmintic and Antibacterial Therapeutics

    Abstract:
    Lymphatic filariasis, a debilitating disease caused by parasitic nematodes, affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in tropical regions of developing nations. Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) from Brugia malayi has emerged as a promising target for therapeutic inhibitor discovery due to its essential role in nematode survival. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of T6PP from B. malayi, revealing a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses using a designed competitive inhibitor, trehalose 6-sulfate, identified five residues crucial for binding and catalysis. Our results suggest that high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, exploiting substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket while utilizing non-native binding to the trehalose pocket. The conservation of key residues in T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria implies that a common strategy for T6PP inhibitor design may be applicable to the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics.

    Methods:
    We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of T6PP from B. malayi. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses were conducted using a designed competitive inhibitor, trehalose 6-sulfate. Molecular dynamics simulations and computational mapping were used to model the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex.

    Main Findings:
    The crystal structure of T6PP from B. malayi revealed a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses identified five residues essential for binding and catalysis. Our results suggest that high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, exploiting substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket while utilizing non-native binding to the trehalose pocket.

    Implications:
    The conservation of key residues in T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria implies that a common strategy for T6PP inhibitor design may be applicable to the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics. This finding has significant implications for the development of new treatments for lymphatic filariasis and other diseases caused by parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides a structural basis for the design of high-affinity inhibitors targeting T6PP from B. malayi. The conservation of key residues in T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests that a common strategy for T6PP inhibitor design may be applicable to the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics. These findings have significant implications for the development of new treatments for lymphatic filariasis and other diseases caused by parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria.

    **Title:** A Novel Computational Framework for Simulating Tumour Vascular Heterogeneity: Implications for Anti-Cancer Therapies

    **Research Question:** Can a novel computational framework that incorporates whole, realistic tumour vasculature and spatially heterogeneous parameters accurately predict tumour fluid dynamics and provide insights into the key biological mechanisms that determine tumour fluid transport?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational framework that couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, to simulate vascular blood flow and interstitial fluid transport in silico. Our model incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumour fluid dynamics. We applied our framework to an orthotopic murine glioma (GL261) and a human colorectal carcinoma (LS147T) and performed sensitivity analysis to understand the key biological mechanisms that determine tumour fluid transport.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that incorporating realistic tumour vasculature is crucial for accurately predicting spatial flow heterogeneities induced by blood vessels. Contrary to literature, we found that reducing tumour interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion, and that developing an IFP gradient across the tumour is the key response. We also hypothesize that stabilizing vessel diameters and permeabilities are not key responses following vascular normalization, and that therapy may alter interstitial hydraulic conductivity.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the development of anti-cancer therapies. We suggest that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumours. Our framework provides a novel tool for simulating tumour vascular heterogeneity, enabling highly-controlled experiments to be performed and providing insights into the key biological mechanisms that determine tumour fluid transport.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating realistic tumour vasculature and spatially heterogeneous parameters in computational models of tumour fluid dynamics. Our framework has the potential to revolutionize the development of anti-cancer therapies by providing accurate predictions of tumour fluid transport and identifying key biological mechanisms that determine tumour response to therapy.
Title: Dissecting the Efficacy of Neutralizing Antibodies and Entry Inhibitors in Cell-Cell Transmission of HIV: Implications for Vaccine and Therapeutic Strategies

Abstract:
The relative importance of cell-cell transmission in HIV infection and the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors against this mode of transmission remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a tailored experimental approach to investigate the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission of HIV. Our results demonstrate that the efficacy of these inhibitors varies depending on their mode of action, with gp41-directed agents remaining active, while CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, lose potency during cell-cell transmission. This finding suggests that CD4bs mAbs preferentially block free virus transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. Our study provides a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in vivo. These results have significant implications for the design of HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors, highlighting the need to consider the efficacy of these interventions against both cell-free and cell-cell transmission modes.

Methods:
We employed a combination of biochemical and virological assays to investigate the activity of neutralizing mAbs and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission of HIV. Specifically, we used a panel of well-characterized mAbs and entry inhibitors to probe their potencies against cell-free and cell-associated virus.

Main Findings:
Our results show that the efficacy of neutralizing mAbs and entry inhibitors varies depending on their mode of action. While gp41-directed agents remain active, CD4bs-directed inhibitors, including VRC01, lose potency during cell-cell transmission. This suggests that CD4bs mAbs preferentially block free virus transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts.

Implications:
These findings have significant implications for the design of HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors. Our results suggest that the efficacy of these interventions needs to be considered against both cell-free and cell-cell transmission modes. This knowledge gap poses a conceptual problem for neutralizing antibody-based HIV vaccine and entry inhibitor design, as it remains uncertain whether both transmission modes must be blocked with equal efficacy or whether only the dominant transmission mode needs to be targeted.

Conclusions:
Our study provides compelling evidence that neutralizing antibodies, depending on their mode of action, differ in their capacity to block free virus and cell-cell transmission. We argue that the efficacy of entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies to block cell-cell transmission needs to be considered in the design of HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in vivo.

**Title:** A Mechanistic Model of Attentional Modulation: Explaining the Effects of Top-Down Attention on Neural Responses

**Research Question:** How can a top-down attentional modulation, falling on higher visual areas, produce the observed effects of attention on neural responses, including changes in firing rates and receptive field structure?

**Methods:** We propose a simple mechanistic model of attentional modulation that requires only the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Our model redistributes top-down modulation to lower areas, altering the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation.

**Main Findings:** Our model reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates (response gain, input gain, and biased competition automatically scaled to receptive field size) and receptive field structure (shifts and resizing of receptive fields both spatially and in complex feature space) without modifying model parameters. Furthermore, our model predicts that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell.

**Implications:** Our model provides a novel explanation for the effects of attention on neural responses, suggesting that attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual system, such as V4 or MT, rather than input areas, such as V1. This challenges existing models of attention, which often posit that attention operates through gain modulation of inputs to the studied layer.

**Conclusions:** Our mechanistic model of attentional modulation offers a simple and parsimonious explanation for the complex effects of attention on neural responses. By incorporating modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area, our model reproduces the observed attentional effects without requiring additional parameters or assumptions. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying attention and visual perception.

    **Title:** Latran, a Non-Signalling Receptor, Regulates JAK/STAT Signalling in Drosophila Hematopoietic Progenitors in Response to Wasp Parasitism

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Latran, a short type I cytokine-related receptor, in regulating JAK/STAT signalling in Drosophila hematopoietic progenitors in response to wasp parasitism?

    **Methods:** We generated a Latran knock-out using homologous recombination and performed in vivo and cell culture assays to investigate the role of Latran in regulating JAK/STAT signalling in response to wasp parasitism.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor, and antagonizes Domeless activity in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that a primary immune response to wasp parasitism involves a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the Latran/Domeless ratio. This sequence of events culminates in the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling by Latran.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mode of regulation of JAK/STAT signalling, based on differential and tissue-specific expression of signalling and antagonist cognate receptors. The tight tissue-specific regulation of JAK/STAT signalling by Latran is crucial for Drosophila to mount a dedicated cellular immune defense against wasp parasitism.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide the first in vivo example of a role for a non-signalling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response. We propose that the shift in the relative levels of Dome and Latran expression observed following wasp egg-laying operates as a switch leading to a complete extinction of JAK/STAT signalling, thus allowing prohemocytes to differentiate into lamellocytes. This study raises the question of whether short, non-signalling receptors also control specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity, and has implications for our understanding of the regulation of JAK/STAT signalling in hematopoiesis and immune functions.

    **Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of Recombination in Begomoviruses: A Study of Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus and Tomato Leaf Curl Comoros Virus

    **Research Question:** What factors influence the patterns of recombination in begomoviruses, and how do selection pressures shape the emergence of recombinant genomes?

    **Methods:** We conducted a 120-day experimental infection of tomato plants with Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus (ToLCV). We analyzed the resulting recombinant genomes for patterns of sequence exchange and identified factors influencing recombination breakpoints.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals complex patterns of recombination between TYLCV and ToLCV, with up to 58 detectable recombination breakpoints observed in individual recombinant genomes. We found that local degrees of sequence similarity, but not genomic secondary structure, strongly influence the occurrence of recombination breakpoints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that natural selection plays a crucial role in shaping the overall patterns of recombination, favoring the preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of begomoviruses, which are responsible for numerous crop pathogens. By identifying the factors influencing recombination breakpoints and the role of selection in shaping recombinant genomes, we can better predict the emergence of new begomoviral strains and develop more effective strategies for disease management.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the dynamics of recombination in begomoviruses, highlighting the importance of local sequence similarity and selection pressures in shaping the emergence of recombinant genomes. Our results demonstrate the complexity of the fitness landscape encountered by TYLCV, ToLCV, and their recombinant progeny, underscoring the need for further research into the mechanisms driving the evolution of begomoviruses.

    **Title:** Nucleosome Repositioning Drives Sequence Divergence in Eukaryotes and Archaea

    **Background:** Nucleosomes, the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, have been implicated in shaping the evolution of eukaryotic genomes through their influence on DNA mutation and selection. However, the relationship between nucleosomes and sequence evolution remains poorly understood, particularly in archaea, where nucleosomes have been found to differ significantly from their eukaryotic counterparts.

    **Research Question:** Do nucleosomes influence sequence evolution in both eukaryotes and archaea, and if so, what is the direction of causality between nucleosome binding and sequence divergence?

    **Methods:** We compared substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in humans to substitution dynamics in the Haloferax clade, a group of halophilic archaea, including the model haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, for which nucleosome organization was recently determined at high resolution.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to expectations, we found that the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is strikingly conserved between humans and Haloferax volcanii. However, neither the mutation nor selection model could explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence divergence. Instead, we demonstrate that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a third model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change. We show that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns. This has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic and archaeal genomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that nucleosome repositioning plays a key role in shaping sequence divergence in both eukaryotes and archaea. This finding underscores the importance of considering the dynamic interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in the evolution of genomes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying nucleosome repositioning and its impact on sequence evolution.

    Title: Identifying Key Positions Sustaining Conformational Diversity in Proteins Associated with Ligand Binding

    Background: The conformational diversity of the native state of proteins plays a crucial role in modulating protein function, particularly in ligand binding. The selection paradigm suggests that different ligands shift the conformational equilibrium by binding to high-affinity conformers. Intramolecular vibrational dynamics facilitate conformational transitions, which may be associated with evolutionary conserved traits.

    Methods: We developed a novel procedure to identify key positions sustaining conformational diversity associated with ligand binding. We applied this method to a refined dataset of 188 paired protein structures in their bound and unbound forms. Normal modes most involved in conformational change were selected based on their overlap with structural distortions introduced by ligand binding. The subspace defined by these modes was used to analyze the effect of simulated point mutations on preserving conformational diversity.

    Main Findings: We found a negative correlation between the effects of mutations on these normal mode subspaces associated with ligand-binding and position-specific evolutionary conservations obtained from multiple sequence-structure alignments. Positions whose mutations altered these subspaces the most were defined as key positions, which are dynamically important residues mediating ligand-binding conformational change. These positions were shown to be evolutionary conserved, mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in regular structural regions of the protein, such as β-sheets and α-helix.

    Implications: Our findings provide a novel approach to identify key positions whose mutations have a significant effect on vibrational normal modes involved in ligand-free to ligand-bound conformational changes. This method allows for the identification of key positions for the evolutionary conservation of protein conformational diversity required for ligand binding.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of conformational diversity in proteins and its association with ligand binding. The identification of key positions sustaining conformational diversity provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein function and ligand binding. These findings have implications for understanding the evolutionary conservation of protein conformational diversity and its role in modulating protein function.
Title: Conditional Essentiality of Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate Aldolase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Revealed by In Vivo and In Vitro Studies

    Abstract:
    The metabolic pathways employed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to establish and maintain infections are crucial for understanding pathogenesis and developing new chemotherapies. We investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), a key enzyme in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, by engineering an Mtb strain with anhydrotetracycline-regulated FBA levels. Depletion of FBA resulted in clearance of Mtb in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, the essentiality of FBA could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, enabling the generation of an fba knockout (Δfba) strain. In vitro studies revealed that the lack of FBA could only be compensated for by a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, where growth and metabolism of butyrate were dependent on Mtb's ability to co-catabolize glucose. These findings not only evaluate FBA as a potential drug target in both replicating and persistent Mtb, but also expand our understanding of the multiplicity of in vitro conditions that define the essentiality of Mtb's FBA in vivo.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in the metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and its essentiality in vivo and in vitro?

    Methods:
    We engineered an Mtb strain with anhydrotetracycline-regulated FBA levels and investigated the effects of FBA depletion on Mtb's growth and survival in vivo and in vitro.

    Main Findings:
    Depletion of FBA resulted in clearance of Mtb in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, the essentiality of FBA could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, enabling the generation of an fba knockout (Δfba) strain. In vitro studies revealed that the lack of FBA could only be compensated for by a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, where growth and metabolism of butyrate were dependent on Mtb's ability to co-catabolize glucose.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that FBA is a potential drug target in both replicating and persistent Mtb, and that the essentiality of FBA is condition-dependent, requiring a specific balance of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the role of FBA in Mtb's metabolism and highlights the importance of considering the multiplicity of in vitro conditions that define the essentiality of Mtb's FBA in vivo. These findings have implications for the development of new chemotherapies targeting FBA in Mtb.

    **Title:** Mitochondrial 2-Cys Peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx) Plays a Novel Role in Leishmania Pathogenicity through Molecular Chaperone Activity

    **Research Question:** What is the functional relevance of the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx) in the Leishmania infantum life cycle?

    **Methods:** A gene replacement strategy was used to generate mTXNPx null mutants (mtxnpx−) in Leishmania infantum. The avirulent phenotype of mtxnpx− was investigated in a murine model of infection and compared to wild-type promastigotes.

    **Main Findings:** mTXNPx null mutants were unable to thrive in a murine model of infection, but this avirulent phenotype was not due to the lack of peroxidase activity of mTXNPx. The enzyme behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants added exogenously or generated by macrophages during phagocytosis ex vivo. Moreover, mtxnpx− were avirulent when inoculated into murine hosts unable to mount an effective oxidative phagocyte response. A peroxidase-inactive version of mTXNPx was able to rescue the non-infective phenotype of mtxnpx−, indicating that the peroxidase activity of mTXNPx is not required for parasite survival in mice.

    **Implications:** The findings reported here change the paradigm that regards all trypanosomatid 2-Cys peroxiredoxins as peroxide-eliminating devices. Instead, mTXNPx plays a novel role in Leishmania pathogenicity through molecular chaperone activity. The enzyme is able to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro, and mtxnpx− were more sensitive to a temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, a phenotype reminiscent of organisms lacking specific chaperone genes.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates, for the first time, that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins can be determinant for pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity. The results provide solid evidence that the essential role played by mTXNPx during the infective stage of Leishmania is independent of its peroxidase activity and highlight the importance of molecular chaperone activity in Leishmania pathogenicity.
Title: Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of ALPHA-Histoplasma Urine Antigen (HUAg) Assay for Progressive Disseminated Histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV-Infected Patients in Mexico

     Abstract:
     Background: Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is a life-threatening fungal infection in HIV-infected patients. The Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) assay is the preferred method for diagnosing PDH, particularly in regions outside the United States. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the ALPHA-HUAg assay, which is approved for on-site use, has not been extensively evaluated.

     Research Question: What is the diagnostic accuracy of the ALPHA-HUAg assay for PDH in HIV-infected patients in Mexico?

     Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, diagnostic test study in two secondary and eight tertiary-care facilities in Mexico. We included 288 HIV patients with suspected PDH and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the ALPHA-HUAg assay using Histoplasma capsulatum growth on blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or compatible histopathologic exam as the reference standard.

     Main Findings: We found that 29.5% (85/288) of patients had PDH. The sensitivity of the ALPHA-HUAg assay was 67.1% (95% CI, 56-76.8%), and the specificity was 97.5% (95% CI, 94.3-99.1%). The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2 (95% CI, 11.6-74.4). Notably, 10.5% of PDH-proven patients had co-existing opportunistic infections, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection.

     Implications: Our results suggest that the ALPHA-HUAg assay has high specificity but low sensitivity for diagnosing PDH in HIV-infected patients in Mexico. While the assay may be useful for initiating early antifungal treatment, a culture-based approach is necessary due to the high frequency of co-infections. A negative result does not rule out PDH, and histopathologic examination should be considered.

     Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of using a culture-based approach for diagnosing PDH in HIV-infected patients, particularly in regions where co-infections are common. The ALPHA-HUAg assay may be useful as an initial screening tool, but its limitations should be taken into account when interpreting results. Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of other HUAg assays and to develop more effective diagnostic strategies for PDH in HIV-infected patients.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Diversity of Viral Communities in Pediatric Diarrhea through Micro-Mass Sequencing

    **Research Question:** What is the spectrum of eukaryotic viral communities present in stool specimens from children with acute diarrhea, and can novel or unexpected viruses be detected using micro-mass sequencing?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel strategy of micro-mass sequencing, which involves minimal starting sample quantity (<100 mg stool), minimal sample purification, and limited sequencing (384 reads per sample), to characterize the eukaryotic viral communities present in stool specimens from 12 children with acute diarrhea.

    **Main Findings:** Using this approach, we detected known enteric viruses as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. Our results demonstrate that micro-mass sequencing can define the diversity of viral communities found in fecal samples from diarrhea patients, including both known and novel viruses.

    **Implications:** The detection of novel or unexpected viruses using micro-mass sequencing has the potential to lay the foundation for future studies aimed at assessing whether these agents play a causal role in human diarrhea. This is particularly relevant, given that approximately 1.8 million children die from diarrhea annually, and millions more suffer from multiple episodes of nonfatal diarrhea, with up to 40% of cases lacking an identified etiologic agent.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the utility of micro-mass sequencing in exploring the viral diversity present in stool during acute episodes of diarrhea in a systematic and unbiased fashion. This approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the complex interactions between viruses and the human gastrointestinal tract, and may ultimately inform the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea. Our findings provide a springboard for further interrogations of the roles of these diverse viruses in the gastrointestinal tract, and highlight the importance of continued research in this area.

    **Title:** Investigating the Transmission Dynamics of Zika and Dengue Viruses in the Dominican Republic: A Retrospective Analysis

    **Background:** Aedes-borne arboviruses, such as Zika and dengue, continue to precipitate epidemics worldwide. In the Dominican Republic, the emergence of Zika virus cases following a large dengue epidemic provided an opportunity to study the transmission drivers behind these two flaviviruses.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to identify and describe the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue across the Dominican Republic, including associated cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), compare the age and sex-adjusted distributions of both Zika and dengue outbreaks, and calculate the reproductive number (R0) of each outbreak.

    **Methods:** Retrospective datasets were used to collect information on populations at risk, and descriptive statistics were employed to describe the outbreaks on a national scale. Crude and age-adjusted, sex-stratified national attack rates were calculated, and box plots were used to visualize the distribution of cases among the population.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed that 75% of dengue cases occurred in individuals under 20 years of age, while Zika infections were more widely dispersed among the population. Dengue attack rates were marginally higher among males (25.9 per 10,000 population) compared to females (21.5 per 10,000 population). In contrast, Zika infections were highly clustered among females (73.8%), with age-adjusted attack rates of 7.64 per 10,000 population compared to 2.72 per 10,000 population among males. R0 calculations also showed a significantly higher metric among females (1.84) compared to males (1.72). However, GBS attack rates were slightly higher in males (0.62 per 10,000 population) compared to females (0.57 per 10,000 population).

    **Implications:** The findings suggest that community awareness campaigns may influence short-term health-seeking behavior, leading to increased reporting among women of reproductive age. Biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out, and media campaigns and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue viruses in the Dominican Republic, highlighting the importance of understanding the demographics most at risk and the impact of sex-specific reporting on epidemiological metrics.

    **Title:** Distinct Poly ( ADP-ribose ) Polymerases and Poly ( ADP-ribose ) Glycohydrolases Mediate Poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** How do poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerases ( PARPs ) and poly ( ADP-ribose ) glycohydrolases ( PARGs ) contribute to poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to DNA damage and immune responses?

    **Methods:** We used Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion lines with mutations in PARP1 ( At2g31320 ) and PARP2 ( At4g02390 ) to examine the functional importance of PARP1 and PARP2 in plant poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation and in effective responses to DNA damage agents. We tested sensitivity to genotoxic agents in Arabidopsis parp1 and parp2 single mutants and in parp1parp2 double mutants.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PARP2, rather than PARP1, makes the greatest contribution to PARP activity and organismal viability in response to genotoxic stresses caused by bleomycin, mitomycin C, or gamma-radiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also found that PARG1, rather than PARG2, is the primary enzyme that counteracts poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we discovered that PARP1 associates with PARP2, and that PARP1 and PARP2 interact with both PARG1 and PARG2.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that core aspects of plant poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation are mediated by substantially different enzymes than in animals, highlighting the likelihood of substantial differences in regulation. Our results also indicate that PARP2 plays a crucial role in plant DNA damage and immune responses, and that PARG1 is essential for counteracting poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in Arabidopsis.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, we have found that although plant PARPs and PARGs have partially overlapping functions, Arabidopsis PARP2 and PARG1 play the predominant roles in plant poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation during DNA damage and immune responses. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in plants and highlight the importance of PARP2 and PARG1 in maintaining genome stability and immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Title: Identification of the MIG-15/JNK-1 Pathway as a Novel Regulator of Glutamatergic Synapse Formation in C. elegans Mechanosensory Neurons

    Abstract:

    Background: The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins are conserved intracellular signaling hubs that regulate synapse formation and axon termination. The C. elegans PHR protein, RPM-1, acts as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways.

    Research Question: What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glutamatergic synapse formation in C. elegans mechanosensory neurons?

    Methods: Using suppressor genetics, we identified several kinases that are likely to form a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse formation defects, but not axon termination defects, in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. We characterized the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway, which includes MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K), and JNK-1 (MAPK).

    Main Findings: Loss of function mutations in kinases of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway specifically suppress defects in synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. Transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons, and these kinases localize to presynaptic terminals, providing further evidence of a role in synapse development.

    Implications: Our findings indicate that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. These results suggest that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway as a novel regulator of glutamatergic synapse formation in C. elegans mechanosensory neurons. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse formation and short-term learning, and highlight the importance of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway in regulating these processes.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Plasticity of a Bipotential Switch in Sex Determination: A Study of TRA-1 and TRR-1 in Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** How does the structure of a bipotential switch change during evolution, and what are the implications for sex determination in Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of null mutants, RNA interference, RT-PCR, and epistasis tests to investigate the role of TRR-1, a co-factor of TRA-1, in sex determination in C. briggsae. We also examined the relationship between TRR-1 and TRA-1 in C. elegans.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that TRR-1 is required for spermatogenesis in C. briggsae and works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transferase complex to promote the expression of Cbr-fog-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. We also found that TRR-1 regulates the development of the male tail and that Cbr-tra-2 and Cbr-trr-1 double mutants resemble Cbr-tra-1 null mutants, indicating that these two regulatory branches control all TRA-1 activity. Furthermore, we observed striking differences in the relationship between these two branches of the switch in C. briggsae and C. elegans, suggesting that the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that TRA-1 is bipotential, capable of activating or repressing the same target genes in response to changing signals from upstream genes. We also show that the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can change rapidly during evolution, leading to alternative, complementary mechanisms for producing the same phenotype.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of sex determination in Caenorhabditis species and highlights the plasticity of bipotential switches in response to changing selective pressures. The identification of TRR-1 as a co-factor of TRA-1 sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination in C. briggsae and C. elegans, and has implications for our understanding of the evolution of sex determination in other organisms.

**Title:** Overcoming Limitations in Measuring Integrated Information: Introducing ΦE and ΦAR

**Research Question:** Can we develop new measures of integrated information, ΦE and ΦAR, that can be applied to time-series data and overcome the limitations of existing measures, such as ΦDM, in quantifying the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts?

**Methods:** We developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, that can be applied to time-series data, unlike ΦDM, which is defined only for discrete Markov systems. We used simulations to demonstrate the in-practice applicability of our measures and to explore their properties.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that ΦE and ΦAR can be easily applied to time-series data and provide new opportunities for examining information integration in real and model systems. These measures can be used to test intuitions regarding consciousness and other neurocognitive processes. However, our findings pose challenges for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities, such as the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IITC).

**Implications:** The development of ΦE and ΦAR opens up new avenues for research in the field of consciousness science and neurocognitive processes. Our measures can be used to empirically examine integrated information in time-series data acquired from neuroimaging and other biological datasets, and to investigate how integrated information is modulated by input and output relations of a system embedded in, and interacting with, a surrounding environment.

**Conclusions:** Our study addresses the limitations of existing measures of integrated information, such as ΦDM, and provides new opportunities for examining information integration in real and model systems. The development of ΦE and ΦAR has significant implications for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities, such as the IITC. Future work will focus on empirically examining integrated information in time-series data and investigating how integrated information is modulated by input and output relations of a system.
Title: Investigating the Spatial Distribution of Rhodesian Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda: A Bayesian Geostatistical Approach

    Abstract:
    The recent resurgence of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda has raised concerns about the potential overlap with the Gambian form of the disease. This study aimed to investigate the environmental and climatic factors controlling the spatial distribution of HAT in two of the most recently affected districts of Uganda, Kaberamaido and Dokolo. We employed a Bayesian geostatistical approach to account for spatial autocorrelation, incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters, and undertake predictive mapping for risk of high HAT prevalence in the future. Our results strongly support the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. We also confirmed the confounding effect of healthcare accessibility on the spatial distribution of HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature. Predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of livestock trading for continued disease spread. Our findings emphasize the need for adherence to government policy to treat livestock at the point of sale to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.

    Research Question:
    What are the environmental and climatic factors controlling the spatial distribution of Rhodesian HAT in Kaberamaido and Dokolo districts of Uganda?

    Methods:
    We employed a Bayesian geostatistical approach using a generalized linear geostatistical model in a Bayesian framework to account for spatial autocorrelation and incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters.

    Main Findings:
    Our results support the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. We also confirmed the confounding effect of healthcare accessibility on the spatial distribution of HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature. Predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the importance of livestock trading for continued disease spread and emphasize the need for adherence to government policy to treat livestock at the point of sale to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates the utility of Bayesian geostatistical modelling for the spatial analysis of HAT and provides strengthened evidence of the role of livestock trade in the continued spread of Rhodesian HAT within Uganda. Our results have important implications for the development of targeted control measures to prevent the spread of HAT in Uganda.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Relationship Between Complexity and Stability in Ecological Networks

    **Research Question:** Does the long-held assumption that complexity begets stability in ecological networks hold true, particularly in species-rich systems?

    **Methods:** We employed analytical and simulation-based approaches to investigate the feasibility of equilibria in ecological networks with varying species richness, interaction structure, and intensity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the existence of a feasible equilibrium is not guaranteed in species-rich systems, contrary to the conventional wisdom. In fact, the probability of observing a feasible equilibrium decreases exponentially with increasing network size. However, we found that weak interactions can lead to the emergence of non-trivial feasible equilibria in ecologically-inspired systems, which is ecologically sensible.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the assumption of equilibrium feasibility in local stability criteria and highlight the importance of considering the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture in understanding ecosystem dynamics. The results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem stability requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the complex relationships between species richness, interaction structure, and intensity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a refinement of May's paradox, which posits that complexity decreases stability in mathematical models. We demonstrate that network architecture plays a non-trivial role in determining equilibrium abundances, and that weak interactions can lead to stable equilibria in ecologically-inspired systems. Our results emphasize the need to focus on the interplay between ecological structure, interaction strengths, and their distribution in network architecture to obtain sensible information on the dynamics of natural systems. Ultimately, our study underscores the importance of considering the complex relationships between species richness, interaction structure, and intensity in understanding ecosystem stability and dynamics.

    Title: One Health Assessment of Q Fever Epidemiology in Western Kenya: Seroprevalence and Risk Factors in Humans and Cattle

    Background: Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a widespread intracellular bacterial pathogen with a near global distribution. Despite increasing attention to Q fever epidemiology in high-income settings, significant gaps remain in understanding the prevalence, spatial distribution, and risk factors for Q fever infection across Africa. This study aimed to provide a One Health assessment of Q fever epidemiology in parts of Western and Nyanza Provinces, Western Kenya, in cattle and humans.

    Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 416 homesteads, analyzing serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle for C. burnetii antibodies. Questionnaires covering demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information were administered, and data were linked to environmental datasets based on geographical locations. Correlation and spatial-cross correlation analyses were applied to assess the potential link between cattle and human seroprevalence. Multilevel regression analysis was used to assess the relationships between socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors and sero-positivity in both humans and animals.

    Main Findings: The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle, with no evidence of correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence within households or when incorporating spatial proximity to other households. Multilevel modeling indicated that cattle obtained from markets and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels had the highest seroprevalence. For humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, variations were observed between ethnic groups, and frequent livestock contact (specifically grazing and dealing with abortion material) was also a risk factor.

    Implications: These results illustrate the endemicity of C. burnetii in Western Kenya, although prevalence is relatively low. The analysis indicates that while environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns, human exposure patterns are likely to be driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The implication of livestock markets in cattle exposure risks suggests these may be a suitable target for interventions.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of livestock contact on transmission of C. burnetii and underscores the need for targeted interventions to reduce the risk of Q fever in humans and animals in Western Kenya.

    **Title:** Identification of Vasa-like Genes in Schistosoma mansoni: Implications for Germ Line Transgenesis and Functional Genomics

    **Research Question:** Can the identification of vasa-like genes in Schistosoma mansoni provide a reliable landmark for germ line transgenesis and functional genomics in this species?

    **Methods:** Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify 33 putative DEAD-box RNA helicases in the S. mansoni genome, including three vasa-like genes (Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3) that exhibited conserved motifs characteristic of the Vasa/PL10 DEAD-box subfamily. Quantitative real-time PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis were used to investigate the expression of Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 in different developmental stages of S. mansoni.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 were transcribed in the posterior ovary of adult female S. mansoni, where oocytes mature, and exhibited elevated expression in sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, with strikingly high expression in undeveloped eggs. These findings suggest that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 are germ cell-specific markers in S. mansoni.

    **Implications:** The identification of vasa-like genes in S. mansoni provides a valuable landmark for germ line transgenesis and functional genomics in this species. Germ cell-specific expression of Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 can be used to monitor the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome germ line, facilitating the development of novel anti-schistosomal interventions.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of vasa-like genes in S. mansoni has significant implications for the development of functional genomic approaches to identify the role and importance of schistosome genes. The germ cell-specific expression of Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 provides a reliable landmark for germ line transgenesis and functional genomics in S. mansoni, underscoring the potential of these genes as targets for intervention in schistosome biology.

    **Title:** VGLL4 Regulates Hippo Signaling to Ensure Proper Heart Valve Development and Homeostasis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of VGLL4 in heart valve development and homeostasis, and how does it interact with the Hippo signaling pathway?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of genetic knockout and semi-knockout approaches in mice to investigate the function of VGLL4 in heart valve development. Tissue-specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells led to valve malformation, while semi-knockout of YAP in VGLL4-ablated hearts rescued the phenotype.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that VGLL4 is essential for proper heart valve development and homeostasis. VGLL4 is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-EMT stage and is maintained until the adult stage. Loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells resulted in abnormal arterial valve morphology and severe cardiac hypertrophy in 36-week-old mice. In contrast, semi-knockout of YAP in VGLL4-ablated hearts significantly constrained hyperproliferation of arterial valve interstitial cells. These findings suggest that VGLL4 antagonizes YAP activity to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis during development and tissue homeostasis.

    **Implications:** This study identifies a previously unknown function of VGLL4 in valve remodeling and homeostasis, and highlights the critical role of the Hippo pathway in regulating valve development and maturation. Our findings suggest that mutations in VGLL4 may underlie human congenital heart valve dysplasia, and that manipulation of Hippo components may be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital valve disease.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates that VGLL4 is a key regulator of heart valve development and homeostasis, and that precise regulation of the Hippo pathway is required for proper proliferation of endocardium-derived mesenchymal cells and subsequent valve elongation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying heart valve development and have important implications for the treatment of congenital heart valve disease.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Prevalence of Soft Sweeps in Natural Populations: A Critical Examination of Recent Studies

    **Research Question:** Do recent studies accurately identify soft sweeps in natural populations, or are they prone to false positives due to methodological limitations?

    **Methods:** We critically evaluate three recent studies on soft sweeps in humans, Drosophila, and HIV using population genetic theory and extensive simulation. We assess the underlying methodologies and statistical performance of these studies to identify potential sources of error.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis reveals that all three studies are susceptible to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. We demonstrate that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns of genomic variation.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the growing trend of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive selection, which may lead to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes and trajectories. The generalization of these results has resulted in misleading answers to decades-old questions in population genetics, with some suggesting a dominant role for positive selection in shaping patterns of genomic variation.

    **Conclusions:** We argue that the lack of sufficient model testing and statistical performance analyses underlying these claims of recurrent soft sweeps has led to inaccurate views of the evolutionary processes governing these organisms under study. Our results highlight the importance of best practices in constructing proper demographic null models and the need for rigorous testing of statistical methods to avoid false positives. We conclude that pervasive soft sweeps are unlikely explanations for the observed patterns of genomic variation in humans, Drosophila, and HIV, and that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Host-Seeking Behavior Inhibition in Female Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes: Identification of Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptor 1 as a Candidate Receptor for Head Peptide-I

    Abstract:
    Background: Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue fever, causing 50-100 million infections annually. The host-seeking behavior of Ae. aegypti is inhibited for three days following a blood meal by a hemolymph-borne humoral factor, with Head Peptide-I being a candidate peptide mediating this suppression. However, the mechanism by which Head Peptide-I alters mosquito behavior and the receptor through which it signals remain unknown.

    Methods: We employed a cell-based calcium imaging assay to identify Ae. aegypti Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors (NPYLRs) that respond to a panel of peptide ligands, including Head Peptide-I and short Neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPFs). We identified eight NPYLRs in the Ae. aegypti genome and found that four of them responded to one or more peptide ligands, with NPYLR1 being the only receptor sensitive to Head Peptide-I and sNPFs.

    Main Findings: Injection of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes, whereas control injections of buffer or inactive Head Peptide-I had no effect. We also generated five independent npylr1 null mutant strains using zinc-finger nucleases and tested them for behavioral abnormalities. Surprisingly, npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg laying, sugar feeding, blood feeding, host seeking, and inhibition of host-seeking after a blood meal.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that NPYLR1 is a candidate sNPF receptor that is also sensitive to Head Peptide-I, but npylr1 alone is not required for host-seeking inhibition. This implies that other receptors, additional peptides, or both, regulate this important behavior.

    Conclusions: In this study, we deorphanized four Ae. aegypti NPYLRs and identified NPYLR1 as a candidate receptor for sNPFs and Head Peptide-I. However, our results indicate that NPYLR1 is not the sole mediator of host-seeking behavior inhibition following a blood meal. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying this behavior and to identify additional receptors and peptides involved.

    Title: Spatial Modeling of Schistosomiasis Risk in Akure North Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria: A Multicriteria Evaluation Approach

    Abstract:
    Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, is influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land surface temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall. This study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure North Local Government Area (LGA) of Ondo State, Nigeria, using satellite imagery and spatial analysis. A multicriteria evaluation (MCE) approach, incorporating Saaty’s Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), was employed to determine the mapping weight or importance of each individual schistosomiasis risk factor. The study focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/land cover as the primary factors controlling schistosomiasis incidence in the study area.

    The results of the weighted overlay analysis revealed varying risk of schistosomiasis, with 82% of the area falling under the high and very high risk category. The study also showed that one community, Oba Ile, had the lowest risk of schistosomiasis, while the risk increased in the four remaining communities, Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogbolu, and Ogbese. The predictions made by the model correlated strongly with observations from field studies, with high risk zones corresponding to known endemic communities.

    This study demonstrated the potential of combining remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) based spatial analyses for schistosomiasis risk modeling. The results can be used to determine the geographical limit of disease distribution, understand disease ecology and epidemiology, support prevention, surveillance, and control, and provide early warning for areas where disease transmission could become established. The study confirmed that satellite-derived environmental data can be used to determine schistosomiasis risk levels in an area using relevant techniques. The spatial model used to produce schistosomiasis risk zones from risk factors showed a strong correlation with field survey records of schistosomiasis prevalence.

    In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of environmental factors in identifying and predicting the transmission of schistosomiasis, as well as effective monitoring of disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities. The findings of this study can inform public health policies and interventions aimed at controlling schistosomiasis in the study area and beyond.

    **Title:** Pneumolysin-Induced Synaptic Damage in Pneumococcal Meningitis: A Novel Mechanism of Neuropathogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of pneumolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the neuropathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis?

    **Methods:** We investigated the neuropathogenic potential of pneumolysin in post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis and in a mouse model of bacterial meningitis. We also examined the effects of pneumolysin on mouse brain slices and astrocytes in vitro.

    **Main Findings:** We observed selective synaptic loss within the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex in post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis. A similar effect was observed in mice with pneumococcal meningitis only when the bacteria expressed the pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin. Exposure of acute mouse brain slices to non-lytic concentrations of pneumolysin caused permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss. The NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 reduced this pathology. Pneumolysin increased glutamate levels within the mouse brain slices, and in mouse astrocytes, pneumolysin initiated the release of glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that pneumolysin plays a significant role in the neuropathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. This mechanism may contribute to the long-term cognitive decline observed in survivors of pneumococcal meningitis.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first evidence of synaptic pathology in pneumococcal meningitis and demonstrates that a bacterial cytolysin can dysregulate the control of glutamate in the brain, inducing excitotoxic damage. Our findings highlight the importance of pneumolysin as a key factor in the neuropathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis and suggest that targeting pneumolysin may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease.

    **Title:** Cell Cycle Progression through Mitosis is Critical for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection

    **Background:** Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers. Developing effective microbicides to prevent HPV infections requires a better understanding of the infectious life cycle of HPVs. The HPV infectious life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus only made in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment.

    **Research Question:** Why do HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia?

    **Methods:** We used chemical biology approaches to investigate the role of cell cycle progression in HPV infection. Infectious HPV16 particles containing the intact viral genome were used to infect G1-synchronized human keratinocytes, and early viral gene expression was used as a readout for infection.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the recipient cell must enter M phase (mitosis) for HPV infection to take place. Late M phase inhibitors had no effect on infection, whereas G1, S, G2, and early M phase cell cycle inhibitors efficiently prevented infection. We conclude that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes.

    **Implications:** These findings provide one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia. Only this compartment of the epithelium contains cells progressing through the cell cycle, and therefore it is only in these cells that HPVs can establish their infection. These results also have potentially important implications for HPV control, as they define a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our data indicate that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for establishing HPV infection. We propose that host genes or gene combinations specifically expressed only in early mitosis might have essential roles for HPV entry steps and/or HPV early gene expression. Further testing in primary keratinocytes and in vivo models is necessary to confirm the physiologically relevance of these findings.

    **Title:** Identification and Characterization of MicroRNA-like RNAs in the Thermal Dimorphic Fungus Penicillium marneffei

    **Research Question:** Do microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) play a role in the regulation of thermal dimorphism in Penicillium marneffei, a pathogenic fungus causing systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia?

    **Methods:** We employed high-throughput sequencing technology to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phases. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, with 17 in mycelial and 7 in yeast phases. We also identified two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins, and the gene qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein.

    **Main Findings:** Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7-fold (P < 0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs was dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis. The regulatory function of milRNAs was supported by the upregulation of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 in a knockdown strain.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism governing thermal dimorphism in P. marneffei and highlights the potential role of post-transcriptional control in regulating gene expression in this pathogenic fungus. The identification of milRNAs in P. marneffei and their differential expression in mycelial and yeast phases opens up new avenues for understanding the biology of this important human pathogen.

    **Title:** Vector Competence of Aedes Mosquitoes in the Pacific Region for the 2013-2017 Zika Virus Outbreak

    **Research Question:** What is the vector competence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis mosquitoes from the Pacific region for the Zika virus (ZIKV) strain that circulated during the 2013-2017 outbreak?

    **Methods:** Field-collected Aedes aegypti (three populations) and Aedes polynesiensis (two populations) from the Pacific region were orally exposed to a ZIKV strain isolated in the region in 2014. Mosquito bodies, heads, and saliva were analyzed at 6, 9, 14, and 21 days post-infection to measure infection, dissemination, transmission rates, and transmission efficiency.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between Aedes aegypti populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and more homogeneous between these populations. In contrast, Aedes polynesiensis populations showed less heterogeneous infection rates. Transmission rates and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, or a large immunologically naive fraction of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013-2017 outbreak.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the vector competence of Aedes mosquitoes in the Pacific region for the ZIKV strain that circulated during the 2013-2017 outbreak. The results indicate that both Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis are capable of transmitting ZIKV, but with low efficiency. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of ZIKV transmission in the Pacific region and highlight the need for further research on the role of other factors contributing to the rapid spread of the virus.

    Title: Targeted Structure-Seq: A Scalable Approach to Probing Long Non-Coding RNA Conformation in Mammalian Cells

    Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as Xist, play crucial roles in regulating gene expression, including X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. Understanding the secondary and higher-order structures of lncRNAs is essential for elucidating their functions, molecular evolution, and modularity. However, probing accessible RNA bases in cells has been a significant challenge.

    Research Question: Can we develop a targeted and scalable approach to analyze the conformation of lncRNAs, such as Xist, in mammalian cells?

    Methods: We developed Targeted Structure-Seq, a novel approach that combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. This method enriches for signals from the RNA of interest, providing high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads.

    Main Findings: We applied Targeted Structure-Seq to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist. Our analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a novel element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function.

    Implications: Targeted Structure-Seq provides a powerful tool for studying lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells, enabling the analysis of large RNAs with high accuracy and scalability. This approach has the potential to advance our understanding of lncRNA function, molecular evolution, and modularity.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the utility of Targeted Structure-Seq for probing lncRNA conformation in cells and provides new insights into the structure and function of Xist. We expect Targeted Structure-Seq to be a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling the systematic analysis of lncRNA conformation and facilitating the development of conformational models of full-length lncRNAs.

    **Title:** A Novel Statistical Framework for Evaluating the Performance of Genetic Risk Prediction Models

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a comprehensive statistical framework to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models for complex diseases, beyond the limitations of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel unifying statistical framework that connects various predictive indices, including AUC, mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement (NRI), proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. We demonstrated how to construct graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve.

    **Main Findings:** We showed that, given the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability (or heritability) explained by the genetic variants, we can estimate analytically a large variety of prediction metrics. The results from simulations matched well with our theoretical estimates. We applied the methodology to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait.

    **Implications:** Our framework provides a more comprehensive assessment of prediction model performance, complementing AUC with other available prediction indices and graphs, particularly when there exist meaningful risk thresholds. This is crucial for evaluating the clinical utility of genetic risk prediction models, as a high level of statistical significance does not equate to good predictive power.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel statistical framework offers a powerful tool for evaluating the performance of genetic risk prediction models, enabling a more accurate assessment of their clinical utility. By considering multiple prediction indices and graphs, we can better understand the strengths and limitations of genetic risk prediction models, ultimately informing the development of more effective personalized medicine approaches. Our results have significant implications for the interpretation of genetic tests, such as those offered by commercial companies like deCODEme, Navigenics, and 23andMe, and highlight the need for a more nuanced evaluation of their predictive power.
Title: Evaluation of a Recombinant Antigen-Based Rapid Diagnostic Test for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

    Abstract:
    Background: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, is a vector-borne neglected tropical disease prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. Serological screening is a crucial entry point in diagnostic algorithms, with the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT) being the most widely used screening test. However, its practical limitations have led to the development of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) using native antigens, which are challenging to produce.

    Research Question: What is the accuracy of a new RDT developed using recombinant antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0) compared to an RDT produced using native antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT) and CATT in diagnosing HAT in the Democratic Republic of the Congo?

    Methods: A total of 57,632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, either passively at 10 health centers or actively by 5 mobile teams, and 260 HAT cases were confirmed by parasitology. The sensitivity and specificity of the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, SD BIOLINE HAT, and CATT were evaluated.

    Main Findings: The highest sensitivity was achieved with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 (71.2%), followed by CATT (62.5%) and the SD BIOLINE HAT (59.0%). The most specific test was CATT (99.2%), while the specificity of the SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 were 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively. Sensitivity of the tests was lower than previously reported, as they identified cases from partially overlapping sub-populations. All three tests were significantly more sensitive in passive than in active screening.

    Implications: Combining two or three tests resulted in a markedly increased sensitivity: When the SD BIOLINE HAT was combined with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, sensitivity reached 98.4% in passive and 83.0% in active screening. The recombinant antigen-based RDT was more sensitive than, and as specific as, the SD BIOLINE HAT. It was as sensitive as, but slightly less specific than CATT.

    Conclusions: The new RDT developed using recombinant antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0) showed improved sensitivity compared to the RDT produced using native antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT) and CATT in diagnosing HAT in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Combining two or more tests appears to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms, although some decrease in specificity is observed. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the practicality and cost-effectiveness of algorithms including several screening tests.

**Title:** Persistent Triatoma dimidiata Infestation and Chagas Disease Transmission in Comapa, Guatemala: A 15-Year Evaluation of Vector Control Activities

**Research Question:** Can multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) effectively control Triatoma dimidiata infestation and reduce Chagas disease transmission in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala?

**Methods:** We conducted three cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys in Comapa between 1999 and 2015 to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control activities. Baseline surveys were conducted in 1999 and 2001-2002, followed by three rounds of IRS (2003-2005) and intermittent focal spraying of infested houses until 2012. Household inspections to determine entomological indices and construction materials were conducted in 2001, 2007, and 2011. Seroprevalence surveys were conducted in school-age children in 1999, 2007, and 2015, and in women of childbearing age (15-44 years) only in 2015.

**Main Findings:** After multiple rounds of IRS, the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% (2001-2002) to 27% (2011). Household construction materials alone predicted <10% of infested houses. Chagas seroprevalence in school-aged children declined by 10-fold, from 10% (1999) to 1% (2015). However, seroprevalence in women of childbearing age remains >10%.

**Implications:** Despite significant reductions in infestation and seroprevalence, the continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. Systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that multiple rounds of IRS can effectively reduce Triatoma dimidiata infestation and Chagas disease transmission in Comapa, Guatemala. However, persistent infestation and seroprevalence in women of childbearing age highlight the need for continued vector control efforts and improved disease screening and treatment programs to achieve the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal.

    **Title:** Unstable Genome of Citrobacter rodentium: Insights into the Evolution of a Recently Emerged Pathogen

    **Background:** Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, sharing a common virulence strategy with human pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). We previously reported the complete genome sequence of C. rodentium strain ICC168, revealing characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen.

    **Research Question:** How does the genome of C. rodentium evolve, and what role do mobile genetic elements play in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed PFGE, sequencing of isolates showing variation, whole-genome transcriptome analysis, and examination of mobile genetic elements to investigate the genomic instability of C. rodentium.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the genome of C. rodentium is unstable due to repeat-mediated, large-scale genome recombination and active transposition of mobile genetic elements, such as prophages. We sequenced an additional C. rodentium strain, EX-33, and found that the reference strain ICC168 is representative of the species, with most inactivating mutations common to both isolates.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. We draw parallels with the evolution of other bacterial pathogens, highlighting the importance of mobile genetic elements in shaping the genome of this pathogen.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the genome of C. rodentium is unstable, with mobile genetic elements playing a key role in its evolution. The emergence of C. rodentium as a significant pathogen may be linked to the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of bacterial pathogens and the role of mobile genetic elements in shaping their genomes.

    **Title:** Inferring Biochemical Rate Constants from Stochasticity in Protein Expression

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a robust and assumption-free approach to infer the molecular mechanisms underlying the shape of protein distributions across cell populations, using stochastic fluctuations in gene expression?

    **Methods:** We derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, demonstrating that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions. We then developed an efficient algorithm for inferring biochemical rate constants governing chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from the moments of protein distributions.

    **Main Findings:** Using this algorithm, we found that most protein distributions are consistent with a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets, despite this degeneracy, the solution space of rate constants almost always informs on underlying mechanism. For example, we distinguished between regimes where transcriptional bursting occurs from regimes reflecting constitutive transcript production. Our method agreed with the current standard approach and identified rate constants not previously obtainable in the restrictive regime where the standard method operates.

    **Implications:** Our approach provides a powerful tool for deducing the contributions of particular molecular mechanisms to specific patterns of gene expression. We demonstrated that our method can estimate individual biochemical rate constants or meaningful ratios of rate constants in 91% of tested cases, and in some cases, identified all underlying rate constants.

    **Conclusions:** This study presents a novel method for inferring biochemical rate constants from stochasticity in protein expression, without making any assumptions. The framework developed here has great promise in learning mechanistic information from stochasticity in protein expression and will be a valuable tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of biological systems, providing new insights into the regulation of gene expression and the underlying biochemical processes that shape protein distributions across cell populations.
Title: Development of a Novel Recombinant Bovine Herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) Vaccine Platform for Monkeypox Virus (MPXV) Protection

    Abstract:

    Background: Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an emerging zoonotic orthopoxvirus endemic in the Congo Basin and sporadic in West Africa, posing a significant threat to public health. The cessation of smallpox vaccination in 1980 has left a large proportion of the population unprotected against MPXV infection. Current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns, and no FDA-approved therapies are available.

    Research Question: Can a novel recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vaccine platform, expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, provide protection against lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice?

    Methods: Three recombinant BoHV-4 vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins (A29L, M1R, and B6R), were constructed and evaluated for their capacity to express their transgene. A small challenge study was performed in STAT1 knockout mice, and the safety and efficacy of the BoHV-4 vectors were assessed.

    Main Findings: The recombinant BoHV-4 vectors were shown to be safe and capable of expressing their transgene. BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK provided 100% and 80% protection, respectively, against mortality and morbidity in STAT1 knockout mice.

    Implications: This study demonstrates the efficacy of the BoHV-4-based vaccine platform and its potential as a novel vaccine vector for MPXV protection. The use of BoHV-4 vectors could provide a safer and more effective alternative to current smallpox vaccines, which are associated with morbidity and contraindicated in a large proportion of the population.

    Conclusions: The development of a recombinant BoHV-4 vaccine platform expressing different MPXV glycoproteins represents a promising approach for the prevention of MPXV infection. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine platform in humans and to explore its potential as a bioterrorism countermeasure.
Title: Identification of ApaH-like Phosphatase ALPH1 as the Major mRNA Decapping Enzyme in Trypanosomes

    Abstract:
    In eukaryotes, including trypanosomes, 5’-3’ decay is the major mRNA decay pathway. However, trypanosomes uniquely lack homologues to all subunits of the decapping complex. Here, we show that the ApaH-like phosphatase ALPH1 acts as the major mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that ALPH1 is essential for mRNA decapping and localizes to P-bodies, where it co-localizes with the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease XRNA. RNAi depletion of ALPH1 causes a massive increase in deadenylated mRNAs that have not yet started 5’-3’ decay, indicating that ALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation. In vitro experiments show that recombinant ALPH1 protein sensitizes the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only in the presence of an RNA 5’ polyphosphatase, suggesting that ALPH1 leaves more than one phosphate group at the mRNA’s 5’ end. This is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class of enzymes present in all phylogenetic super-groups of the eukaryotic kingdom. Our findings provide strong evidence for ALPH1 being the trypanosome decapping enzyme and reveal a novel mechanism of mRNA decapping that differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2.

    Research Question:
    What is the identity and function of the mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, including RNAi depletion, co-localization studies, and in vitro enzymatic assays, to investigate the function of ALPH1 in mRNA decapping.

    Main Findings:
    We show that ALPH1 is essential for mRNA decapping and localizes to P-bodies, where it co-localizes with the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease XRNA. RNAi depletion of ALPH1 causes a massive increase in deadenylated mRNAs that have not yet started 5’-3’ decay, indicating that ALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation. In vitro experiments show that recombinant ALPH1 protein sensitizes the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only in the presence of an RNA 5’ polyphosphatase.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide strong evidence for ALPH1 being the trypanosome decapping enzyme and reveal a novel mechanism of mRNA decapping that differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2. This study highlights the importance of ApaH-like phosphatases in eukaryotic mRNA metabolism and suggests that these enzymes may play a conserved role in mRNA decapping across the eukaryotic kingdom.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study identifies ALPH1 as the major mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes and reveals a novel mechanism of mRNA decapping that differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of mRNA metabolism in trypanosomes and highlight the importance of ApaH-like phosphatases in eukaryotic mRNA metabolism.

    **Title:** Arx Inhibition Promotes α-Cell Conversion into β-Like Cells and Regeneration of Functional β-Cell Mass

    **Research Question:** Can the selective inhibition of the Arx gene in α-cells promote the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells and regenerate a functional β-cell mass?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches to investigate the effects of Arx inhibition on α-cell conversion and β-cell regeneration in mice. We generated Arx conditional knockout (Glu-ArxKO) and double-mutant (Dox+ IndGlu-ArxKO) mice to study the role of Arx in α-cell fate determination and β-cell regeneration.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the selective inhibition of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells at any age. This conversion induces the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, generating glucagon+ cells that are subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. Notably, the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that strategies aiming at inhibiting the expression of Arx, or its molecular targets/co-factors, may pave new avenues for the treatment of diabetes. The continuous cycle of β-like cell regeneration initiated by Arx inhibition is able to counter toxin-induced diabetes, maintaining euglycemia.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the sole loss of the Arx gene in α-cells is sufficient to initiate a continuous cycle of glucagon+ cell neo-formation and their conversion into β-like cells, leading to the regeneration of a functional β-like cell mass. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat diabetes.

    **Title:** Local Control of Replication Initiation Reveals a Complex Genomic Landscape of Re-replication Potential

    **Research Question:** How do eukaryotic cells prevent re-initiation of DNA replication at thousands of origins in their genome, and what are the mechanisms that regulate this process?

    **Methods:** We used a sensitized system where global mechanisms preventing re-replication were compromised to investigate the regulation of replication initiation. We identified novel genetic elements, termed re-initiation promoters (RIPs), that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of specific origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins.

    **Main Findings:** We mapped the RIP elements to ∼60 bp AT-rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. During the induction of re-replication, Mcm2-7 reassociates with both origins that preferentially re-initiate and origins that do not, suggesting that the RIP elements can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after Mcm2-7 associates with origins.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a local level of control in the block to re-initiation, creating a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential. This suggests that some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to genomic alterations, such as those that occur in cancer cells, than others.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first insight into how diversity can be introduced in the regulation of eukaryotic replication origins. The identification of RIP elements highlights the existence of a local level of control in the block to re-initiation, which challenges the implicit assumption that all replication origins are uniformly regulated by global inhibition mechanisms. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of genome stability and the role of re-replication in genomic alterations, particularly in cancer cells.
Title: Clinical and Epidemiological Features of Invasive Amebiasis in HIV-1-Infected Patients: A Retrospective Analysis of 170 Cases

     Abstract:
     Invasive amebiasis (IA) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a significant public health concern, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those co-infected with HIV-1. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of IA in HIV-1-infected patients in developed East Asian countries. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 170 co-infected cases and genotyped E. histolytica in 14 cases. Our results show that the clinical presentation of IA in HIV-1-infected patients is similar to that in immunocompetent individuals, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was effective in 165 cases, with no significant difference in recurrence rates between those who received luminal treatment and those who did not. However, recurrence was more frequent in HCV-antibody positive individuals and those who acquired syphilis during follow-up. Our findings suggest that luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment does not reduce recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations, likely due to re-infection. The study highlights the need for educational approaches to prevent new amebic infections in high-risk groups, such as HIV-1-infected MSM. Our results also emphasize the importance of genotyping E. histolytica to better understand the epidemiology of IA in these populations.

    **Title:** Evaluating the Impact of Vector Control on Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) Incidence in the Mandoul Focus, Chad

    **Background:** Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as Gambian sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by riverine species of tsetse flies. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eliminate HAT as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 2030.

    **Research Question:** Can the addition of vector control to case detection and treatment further reduce transmission and consequently, reduce the annual incidence of HAT in the Mandoul focus, Chad?

    **Methods:** A pre-intervention survey of tsetse distribution and abundance was conducted in November 2013, followed by the deployment of 2600 "tiny targets" in the riverine habitats of tsetse in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population were conducted in 2014 and 2015. Mathematical modeling was used to assess the relative impact of tsetse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening.

    **Main Findings:** The census indicated a population of 38,674 inhabitants in the vicinity of the Mandoul focus. The mean catch of tsetse from traps declined from 0.7 flies/trap/day to 0.005 tsetse/trap/day after target deployment. Modeling indicates that 70.4% (95% CI: 51-95%) of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, with the rest due to medical intervention. Tiny targets are estimated to have reduced new infections dramatically, with 62.8% (95% CI: 59-66%) of the reduction due to tsetse control, and 8.5% (95% CI: 8-9%) to enhanced passive detection.

    **Implications:** The results suggest that the combination of tsetse control and medical detection and treatment has played a major role in reducing HAT incidence in 2014 and 2015. Model predictions anticipate that elimination as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 in this focus if vector control and screening continue at the present level, with virtually no transmission since 2015.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of tiny targets in reducing tsetse populations and interrupting transmission of HAT in the Mandoul focus, Chad. The findings support the use of vector control as a complementary strategy to case detection and treatment in the control of HAT.
Title: Epidemiological, Clinical, and Microbiological Characteristics of Imported Strongyloidiasis in Spain: A Retrospective Study of 1245 Cases

Abstract:

Background: Strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, is increasingly being diagnosed in non-endemic areas, including Spain. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with imported strongyloidiasis in Spain.

Methods: This observational retrospective study included all patients diagnosed with strongyloidiasis registered in the +REDIVI Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information was collected from the +REDIVI database, and additional information regarding microbiological techniques, treatment, and follow-up was requested from participating centers.

Results: A total of 1245 cases were included, with most being immigrants (66.9%) from South America. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests allowed for diagnosis in the remaining cases. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment with ivermectin, compared to albendazole, was the most strongly associated factor with achieving cure (OR 2.34).

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of screening for S. stercoralis infection in patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, particularly those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation. The findings also suggest that ivermectin may be a more effective treatment option for strongyloidiasis than albendazole. Future studies should investigate the optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for imported strongyloidiasis in non-endemic areas.

    **Title:** Optimizing Vaccine Inoculum Dose: A Quantitative Modeling Framework for Rational Vaccine Design

    **Research Question:** What is the optimal inoculum dose for a vaccine to achieve the desired level of immune protection while minimizing morbidity, and how can mathematical models be used to inform this decision?

    **Methods:** We developed a quantitative modeling framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data to study the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity. We applied this framework to data from two infection experiments: influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen, and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. We demonstrate that our framework can be used to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity, and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the inoculum dose in vaccine formulation, as higher doses may lead to better stimulation of the immune response but also increase the risk of severe side effects and reduce population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Our framework provides a systematic and quantitative approach to determining the optimal inoculum dose for a given vaccine, taking into account the desired level of immune protection and acceptable levels of morbidity.

    **Conclusions:** We propose a conceptual, quantitative framework that can be used to rationally design vaccines and determine an optimal inoculum dose for any pathogen. Our framework combines mathematical models with experimental data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity. By applying this framework to specific vaccine candidates, we can more efficiently determine the optimal dose and improve vaccine efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Coupled Fluctuations of Gene Expression in Anabaena Filaments under Nitrogen Deprivation

    **Research Question:** How do fluctuations in gene expression of the HetR transcription factor, essential for heterocyst differentiation, correlate between cells along Anabaena filaments under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions?

    **Methods:** We employed a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion to study the statistics of fluctuations in hetR expression in wild-type and mutant Anabaena filaments under steady-state growth in nitrogen-rich conditions and at different times following nitrogen deprivation.

    **Main Findings:** Statistical analysis of fluorescence at the individual cell level revealed that expression fluctuations of hetR in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of circa two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. Correlations between cells predominantly arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less from cell division. Fluctuations after nitrogen step-down can build up on those under nitrogen-replete conditions. We found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ, and positive HetR auto-regulation are essential determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that proteins involved in activation, inhibition, and cell-cell communication combine together in the presence of inevitable stochasticity in gene expression to control the coupled fluctuations of gene expression that give rise to a one-dimensional developmental pattern in Anabaena.

    **Conclusions:** We have characterized the variability and spatial distribution of hetR-gfp expression levels along Anabaena filaments, both under nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-poor conditions, and calculated correlations between the expression levels in cells along filaments. Our study reveals that key factors known to act during differentiation following nitrogen deprivation can also play a role before differentiation has been triggered, setting an underlying pattern of spatial correlations of gene expression along filaments. These correlations extend to two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between gene expression, cell-cell communication, and developmental processes in multicellular organisms.
Title: Shift in Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) Genotype Dominance in China: Enhanced Replication Efficiency of Genotype I (GI) Strains in Avian and Porcine Cells

    Abstract:
    Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) has emerged as the dominant genotype in China, replacing genotype III (GIII), as demonstrated by molecular epidemiological surveillance. To confirm this genotype shift at the sero-epidemiological level, we conducted a serological survey in JEV-non-vaccinated pigs and observed an average ratio of GI/GIII infection of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with GI being more prevalent. To investigate the reasons behind this shift, we compared the replication kinetics of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI strains and four GIII strains, in mosquito C6/36 cells, chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC). Our results showed that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in DF-1 and PIEC cells, particularly in DF-1 cells, with titers reaching 22.9–225.3 fold higher than GIII strains. This enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in avian cells was further confirmed in vivo using young domestic ducklings as an animal model, where GI-inoculated ducklings developed higher viremia titers and displayed a longer viremic duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings. These findings support the hypothesis that the enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in birds contributes to their increased transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle, thereby contributing to the JEV genotype shift. The 36 amino acid differences between GI and GIII viruses may be responsible for this enhanced replication efficiency. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying JEV genotype shift and its implications for the development of effective control strategies.

    **Title:** Systematic Analysis of the Candida albicans Biofilm Transcription Factor Network Reveals a Highly Interdependent ‘Small-World’ Network

    **Research Question:** How do the six transcription factors (Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1) in the Candida albicans biofilm network function together to regulate biofilm formation?

    **Methods:** We employed a systematic genetic interaction approach to generate all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and quantitatively analyze the genetic interactions between them.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with all six network heterozygous mutants exhibiting alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency). Moreover, many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating that the network is highly interdependent. The network exhibits properties of a ‘small-world’ network, which is highly efficient but not robust. Notably, TEC1 is a network component whose expression is highly sensitive to small perturbations in the function of other network transcription factors (TFs). We also found that ROB1 expression is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network TFs. Furthermore, the heterozygous NDT80 deletion mutant is hyperfilamentous under both biofilm and hyphae-inducing conditions in a TEC1-dependent manner.

    **Implications:** Our genetic interaction analysis provides new insights into the functions of individual TFs and the role of the overall network topology in its function. The findings suggest that the structure and function of the biofilm TF network contributes to the ability of small perturbations at a number of nodes to be communicated through the network to regulate the expression of a functionally important member of the network.

    **Conclusions:** The systematic analysis of the Candida albicans biofilm transcription factor network reveals a highly interdependent ‘small-world’ network that is highly efficient but not robust. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of Candida albicans biology and pathobiology, and highlight the importance of considering the network topology in understanding the regulation of biofilm formation.
Title: Reevaluation of Asparagine Synthetase A (AS-A) as a Drug Target in Leishmania infantum

    Abstract:

    Background: Asparagine (Asn) metabolism has garnered significant attention in cancer and infection research, with Asparagine Synthetase (AS) playing a crucial role in converting aspartate into Asn. Two structurally distinct AS enzymes, type A and B, have been identified, with AS-A being absent in humans but present in trypanosomatids.

    Research Question: Is AS-A essential for the survival, growth, and infectivity of Leishmania infantum, making it a suitable drug target?

    Methods: We generated LiAS-A null mutants by targeted gene replacement in L. infantum and assessed their growth and infectivity in vitro and in vivo.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that LiAS-A can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen donors, similar to Trypanosoma spp. and L. donovani. However, LiAS-A null mutants did not display significant growth or infectivity defects in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. Only under asparagine-limiting conditions did we observe a severe impairment of in vitro growth.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that LiAS-A is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in normal conditions, making it an unsuitable drug target against L. infantum.

    Conclusions: Our study reevaluates the potential of AS-A as a drug target in L. infantum, excluding it as a viable option due to its non-essentiality in normal conditions. These results have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Leishmaniasis.

    Title: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Association between Toxocariasis and Epilepsy

    Background: Toxocariasis, a parasitic infection caused by Toxocara spp., has been linked to various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. However, the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy remains debated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between Toxocara spp. seropositivity and epilepsy in light of recent evidence.

    Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Ingenta Connect, Science Direct, and others, was conducted without language or date restrictions up to November 2017. Eleven case-control studies from 13 countries worldwide, involving 4740 subjects (2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 without epilepsy), were included in the analysis. A pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated using a random effects model, and meta-regression was conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.

    Main Findings: The overall pooled OR was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between Toxocara spp. seropositivity and epilepsy. A positive association was consistently reported in restricted analyses, including Western Blot as a confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger population, and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no statistically significant association between covariates and outcome.

    Implications: This updated meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara spp. seropositivity and epilepsy. The findings support the notion that toxocariasis may contribute to the development of epilepsy, particularly in population-based studies. The results have significant implications for public health strategies aimed at reducing the impact of Toxocara spp. infections.

    Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the need for further research to understand the physiopathological mechanisms underlying toxocara-associated epileptogenesis. The findings suggest that Toxocara spp. seropositivity may be a risk factor for epilepsy, and therefore, health strategies to prevent and control toxocariasis are strongly advised. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the relationship between toxocariasis and epilepsy and to develop effective prevention and treatment measures.
Title: ATM-Dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP Axis Regulates Homologous Recombination Repair in Response to DNA Double-Strand Breaks

    Abstract:
    DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a significant threat to genome stability, and the cellular response to these lesions is tightly regulated by the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase. Here, we describe a novel ATM-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway involving microRNA (miRNA) regulation. Irradiation (IR)-induced DSBs activate ATM, leading to the downregulation of miR-335, a miRNA that targets CtIP, a crucial mediator of homologous recombination repair (HRR). We demonstrate that CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) is responsible for miR-335 expression by binding to its promoter region, and that IR-induced ATM phosphorylation of CREB reduces its transcription activity. Overexpression of miR-335 in HeLa cells impairs CtIP levels, post-IR colony survival, and BRCA1 foci formation. Furthermore, in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with decreased post-IR colony survival, we observed elevated miR-335 expression, reduced CtIP levels, and impaired BRCA1 foci formation. Treatment with miRNA antisense oligonucleotides (AMO-miR-335) partially rescued colony survival, BRCA1 foci, and CtIP levels. Our findings suggest that the ATM-dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions.

    Methods:
    We used HeLa cells and patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines to investigate the ATM-dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis in response to IR-induced DSBs. We employed siRNA-mediated knockdown of CREB, overexpression of miR-335, and treatment with miRNA antisense oligonucleotides (AMO-miR-335) to modulate the expression of miR-335 and CtIP.

    Main Findings:
    We identified a novel ATM-mediated DDR pathway involving the CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis, which regulates BRCA1 foci formation, cell cycle checkpoint regulation, DNA repair, and cell survival. Overexpression of miR-335 impaired CtIP levels, post-IR colony survival, and BRCA1 foci formation, while treatment with AMO-miR-335 partially rescued these defects.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that the ATM-dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis plays a critical role in regulating HRR in response to DSBs. Dysregulation of this axis may contribute to radiosensitivity in certain cell types.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study reveals a novel ATM-mediated DDR pathway involving the CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis, which influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions. Further investigation of this axis may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying radiosensitivity and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

    **Title:** The Role of Sophisticated Mentalizing in Learning during Social Interactions

    **Research Question:** Can sophisticated mentalizing processes, characterized by recursive beliefs, enhance learning in the context of repeated social interactions?

    **Methods:** In this study, participants engaged in repeated games against artificial mentalizing agents with varying levels of sophistication, presented in either a social or non-social framing. The social framing was designed to make participants believe they were playing against another human, while the non-social framing was presented as a casino-style game.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that participants outperformed artificial mentalizing agents in the social framing, but not in the non-social framing. Furthermore, participants' choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social framing. This suggests that mentalizing plays a crucial role in learning during social interactions.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first demonstration of the added-value of mentalizing on learning in the context of repeated social interactions. The findings support the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis, which posits that our brain assumes others are Bayesian learners, and that mentalizing involves the update of recursive beliefs from repeated observation of others' behavior.

    **Conclusions:** The results of this study highlight the importance of sophisticated mentalizing processes in learning during social interactions. The social framing of the task induced participants to mentalize and engage in recursive inference, while domain-general learning heuristics were vulnerable to artificial mentalizing agents in the non-social framing. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of human social cognition and learning, and suggest that mentalizing is essential for deciphering intentional behavior in others. The study's results also underscore the importance of considering the social context in which learning takes place, and the need to develop more sophisticated models of human social cognition that incorporate mentalizing processes.

    **Title:** Efficient Estimation of Gaussian Graphical Models for High-Dimensional Biological Networks

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a computationally efficient algorithm to estimate Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) for high-dimensional biological networks, enabling the analysis of complex diseases beyond traditional single-variable approaches?

    **Methods:** We propose an efficient algorithm, FastGGM, to implement the estimation of GGMs and obtain p-values and confidence intervals for each edge in the graph. Our approach is based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. (2015) and is designed to handle high-dimensional data with tens of thousands of variables.

    **Main Findings:** Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that FastGGM is significantly faster (by several orders of magnitude) than the current implemented algorithm for Ren et al. without compromising accuracy. We apply our algorithm to two real data sets: transcriptomic data from a childhood asthma study and proteomic data from an Alzheimer’s disease study. Our results reveal interesting interactions and differential networks between cases and controls, showing functional relevance to the diseases.

    **Implications:** FastGGM provides a computationally fast and statistically sound procedure for constructing GGMs and making inference with high-dimensional biological data. This enables researchers to study large-scale networks, such as gene/protein networks, using GGM in practice. Our algorithm is an exact implementation of the asymptotically normal and efficient estimation established by Ren et al. (2015), making it a valuable tool for network analysis under the framework of conditional dependence.

    **Conclusions:** We present a novel efficient algorithm, FastGGM, for the statistical inference of GGMs. Our algorithm has been implemented in an R package, which can be downloaded from http://www.pitt.edu/~wec47/FastGGM.html. FastGGM has the potential to become a powerful tool for network analysis under the framework of conditional dependence, especially for high-dimensional biological data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of inferring biological networks at a whole-genome scale, opening up new avenues for the analysis of complex diseases.

    **Title:** Optimal Striatal Network Connectivity for Learning and Execution of Movement Sequences

    **Research Question:** What is the optimal level of connectivity in the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network for the learning and execution of movement sequences, and how does it interact with temporally varying cortical driving activity?

    **Methods:** We used a computational model of a local MSN network to investigate how population activity interacts with cortical driving activity, as would occur in a behavioral task. We varied the connectivity of the network and the size of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) generated by MSNs.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that at unrealistically high connectivity, the network exhibits a stable "winners-take-all" regime, where activity separates into fixed stimulus-dependent regularly firing and quiescent components. However, at striatally realistic connectivities, a transition to a more dynamically active regime occurs, where all cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence. This regime is characterized by weak changes in cortical driving interacting with many population components, resulting in reproducible activation of sequential cell assemblies for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the local MSN network is optimized to generate stimulus-dependent activity patterns for long periods after variations in cortical excitation. This is achieved at striatally realistic connectivities and IPSP sizes, indicating that the network is neither too stable nor too unstable to respond to cortical variations.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of slowly varying activity in the striatum, which is essential for the learning and execution of movement sequences. We propose that the local MSN network has optimal characteristics, allowing it to respond in a dynamically complex and temporally extended way to cortical variations, while maintaining consistency and repeatability. This study contributes to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying motor learning and execution, and has implications for the development of models of basal ganglia function in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Title: Sec4p Couples Polarized Exocytosis with Cortical Actin Polymerization to Regulate Endocytosis and Cell Polarization

    Abstract:

    Background: Polarized growth in eukaryotic cells is maintained by the dynamic interplay between polarized exocytosis and endocytosis. While these two transport pathways are generally considered separate events, recent studies suggest that they may be functionally linked.

    Research Question: What is the role of the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p in coupling polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization and endocytosis?

    Methods: We employed live cell imaging, in vivo and in vitro protein binding assays, and in vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays to investigate the relationship between Sec4p, polarized exocytosis, and cortical actin polymerization.

    Main Findings: Our results show that Sec4p binds Las17/Bee1p (yeast WASp) in a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch assembly after polarized exocytosis to the plasma membrane. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, whereas the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization established that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation.

    Implications: Our findings support a model in which Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis, promoting actin polymerization and triggering compensatory endocytosis, which controls surface expansion and kinetically refines cell polarization.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals a novel role for Sec4p in coupling polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization and endocytosis, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell polarization. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the dynamic interplay between exocytosis and endocytosis in eukaryotic cells.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury in Mice: A Multilevel, Multiscale Explanation

Abstract:
Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) in mice is a widely used model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. Despite significant progress in identifying molecular-level events and pathways, the underlying mechanism of AILI remains elusive. The Target Phenomenon in mice is that necrosis begins adjacent to the central vein (CV) of hepatic lobules and progresses outward. We propose the NZ-mechanism hypothesis, which suggests that location-dependent differences in NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) formation within hepatic lobules (NAPQI zonation) are necessary and sufficient to account for this phenomenon. However, employing the NZ-mechanism in virtual hepatocytes failed to achieve the Target Phenomenon. To address this limitation, we posited that at least one additional feature must exhibit zonation by decreasing in the CV direction. We instantiated and explored two alternatives: glutathione depletion threshold and ability to repair mitochondrial damage. Inclusion of one or the other feature into the NZ-mechanism failed to achieve the Target Phenomenon, but inclusion of both features enabled successful achievement of the Target Phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale causal explanation of key temporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity in mice. Furthermore, variants of the merged mechanism provide plausible quantitative explanations for the considerable variation in 24-hour necrosis scores among 37 genetically diverse mouse strains following a single toxic APAP dose.

Methods:
We employed a computational model of virtual hepatocytes to simulate APAP metabolism and toxicity. The model was engineered to be quantitatively and qualitatively biomimetic across all anatomical, hepatic zonation, and cell biology features currently believed relevant to challenging the NAPQI zonation hypothesis.

Main Findings:
Our results show that zonation of NAPQI formation alone is insufficient to explain early perivenous necrosis. However, inclusion of both glutathione depletion threshold and ability to repair mitochondrial damage into the NZ-mechanism enabled successful achievement of the Target Phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale causal explanation of key temporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity in mice.

Implications:
Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of APAP-induced liver injury in mice and humans. The merged mechanism provides a framework for predicting injury and developing new treatment strategies. Furthermore, variants of the merged mechanism provide plausible quantitative explanations for the considerable variation in 24-hour necrosis scores among 37 genetically diverse mouse strains following a single toxic APAP dose.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, our study provides a multilevel, multiscale explanation of the mechanism of APAP-induced liver injury in mice. The merged mechanism highlights the importance of considering multiple factors, including glutathione depletion threshold and ability to repair mitochondrial damage, in addition to NAPQI zonation. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of APAP-induced liver injury in mice and humans and provide a framework for predicting injury and developing new treatment strategies.
Title: Quantification of Parasitemia in Congenitally Infected Children with Trypanosoma cruzi: Implications for Early Diagnosis and Treatment

    Abstract:

    Background: Congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a significant public health concern. The diagnosis of congenitally infected infants relies on the detection of parasites by INP micromethod and/or the persistence of T. cruzi-specific antibody titers at 10-12 months of age.

    Research Question: What are the parasitemia levels in congenitally infected children at different stages of infection, and how do these levels correlate with the sensitivity of the INP micromethod and serological diagnosis?

    Methods: We quantified parasitemia levels by PCR in 51 congenitally infected children, grouped according to the results of one-year follow-up diagnosis: Group A (n=19) diagnosed by INP micromethod within the first month after delivery, Group B (n=10) diagnosed by INP micromethod at six months of age, and Group C (n=22) diagnosed by serology at around 1 year old.

    Main Findings: We found that Group A had a median parasitemia of 1,700 Pe/mL, Group B had a median parasitemia of 20 Pe/mL at 1 month and 500 Pe/mL at 6 months, and Group C had a median parasitemia of 5 Pe/mL, 800 Pe/mL, and 20 Pe/mL at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. T. cruzi parasites were isolated by hemoculture from 19 congenitally infected children, 18 of which were genotyped as DTU TcV (former lineage TcIId) and one as TcI.

    Implications: Our results show that the parasite burden in some children (22 out of 51) is below the detection limit of the INP micromethod, highlighting the need for more sensitive parasitological methods to ensure early T. cruzi congenital diagnosis. The current trypanocidal treatment proved to be very effective in curing T. cruzi-infected children.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first quantification of parasitemia levels in more than 50 children congenitally infected with T. cruzi at three different diagnostic controls during one-year follow-up after delivery. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing more sensitive parasitological methods to improve the early diagnosis of congenitally infected newborns, allowing for prompt and effective trypanocidal treatment.

    Title: A Biophysical Model of Escherichia coli Predicts Optimal rRNA Operon Copy Number for Balanced Exponential Growth

    Research Question: What is the optimal rRNA operon copy number for Escherichia coli (E. coli) to achieve balanced exponential growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment rich in resources?

    Methods: We developed a biophysical model of E. coli that predicts growth rate and effective cellular composition from an effective, coarse-grained representation of its genome. We applied this model to a series of past measurements of growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio for seven E. coli strains with rRNA operon copy numbers ranging from one to seven (wild-type copy number).

    Main Findings: Our model reproduces the observed decrease in growth rate for strains with fewer than six copies of the rRNA operon. The model suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. Furthermore, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven results in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins, leading to weakened binding affinities and a plateau in growth rate.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate. This is consistent with other observations regarding strains with altered rRNA operon copy numbers, such as nucleoid compaction and the rRNA operon feedback response.

    Conclusions: Our biophysical model provides a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between rRNA operon copy number and growth rate in E. coli. The model suggests that basic kinetic and biophysical considerations may have an important role in determining an optimal rRNA operon copy number for balanced exponential growth in a constant and rich medium. Future experiments are proposed to test the validity of this model and explore its implications for understanding bacterial growth and adaptation.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1 (RSM1) in Plant Responses to Abiotic Stresses and ABA Signaling

    Abstract:
    The MYB transcription factor family plays a crucial role in regulating various biological processes in plants, including metabolism, development, and stress responses. RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1 (RSM1), a member of the MYB-related subfamily, has been implicated in plant development, stress responses, and hormone signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms of RSM1 action in response to abiotic stresses remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the roles of RSM1 and its homologs in plant responses to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity during seed germination and seedling development. Our results show that down-regulation or up-regulation of RSM1 expression alters the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. We found that the expression of RSM1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl, and that transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) regulate RSM1 expression via binding to the RSM1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal that RSM1 mediates multiple functions of HY5 in responses of seed germination, post-germination development to ABA and abiotic stresses, and seedling tolerance to salinity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RSM1 interacts with HY5/HYH in vitro and in vivo, and that RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. Additionally, we show that RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), thereby regulating its expression, while RSM1 interaction also stimulates HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. Our findings suggest that HY5/HYH and RSM1 may converge on the ABI5 promoter and independently or dependently regulate ABI5 expression and ABI5-downstream ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes, thereby improving the adaptation of plants to the environment. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of RSM1 action in plant responses to abiotic stresses and ABA signaling, and highlights the importance of the RSM1-HY5/HYH-ABI5 regulatory module in plant adaptation to environmental stresses.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Proton Pumping Mechanism of Mitochondrial Complex I: Evidence for Two Functionally Distinct Pump Modules

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism of proton pumping in the membrane arm of mitochondrial complex I, and what is the number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites?

    **Background:** Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complicated proton pump of the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Defects in complex I are involved in a wide range of degenerative disorders.

    **Methods:** We deleted the gene for a small accessory subunit of the Yarrowia complex I and generated a stable subcomplex (nb8mΔ) that lacks the distal part of the membrane domain. We analyzed the subunit composition of holo and subcomplex using three complementary proteomic approaches.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that two subunits with homology to bacterial Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters (ND4 and ND5) are missing in nb8mΔ, yet the subcomplex still pumps protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. Single particle analysis revealed that nb8mΔ lacks the distal part of the membrane domain.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that the membrane arm of complex I harbors two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by a long helical transmission element. This suggests that the proton pumping mechanism of complex I is more complex than previously thought.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of proton pumping in mitochondrial complex I, shedding light on the long-standing question of the number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites. The discovery of two functionally distinct pump modules has significant implications for our understanding of the bioenergetic diseases associated with complex I defects. Further research is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of proton pumping in complex I and its relevance to human disease.

    **Title:** Temperature-Dependent Modulation of Antibody-Antigen Binding Affinity: A Novel Role for Fever in Enhancing Immune Responses

    **Background:** Fever is a regulated increase in body temperature that plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses to infection. However, the potential of febrile temperatures in regulating antibody-antigen binding affinity has not been explored.

    **Research Question:** Do febrile temperatures influence the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens from infectious pathogens?

    **Methods:** We used Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to investigate the binding affinity of monoclonal antibodies to malarial and dengue antigens at physiological (37°C), febrile (40°C), and pathophysiological (42°C) temperatures.

    **Main Findings:** We observed a marked increase in the affinity of antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C compared to 37°C or 42°C. Thermal equilibration of the protein partners prior to measurements further increased their binding affinity. Specifically, we found a ~1.15-1.3 increase in affinity from 37°C to 40°C in the absence of thermal priming, and a significant improvement in KD by a factor of ~9.5 (at 37°C) and ~8 (at 40°C) for the dengue immune complex after thermal pre-equilibration.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that fever may play a positive and adaptive role in vivo by enhancing the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens from infectious pathogens. Thermal priming of protein partners prior to measurements may improve the binding affinities and inform on the appropriate temperature conditions of the testing environment, particularly in cases where limited amounts of samples are available.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the potential for reversible, physiological fever temperatures to increase in vitro antibody affinity for tertiary and quaternary epitopes, and suggests a thermal activation step for fever antibodies binding to antigens. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of immune responses to infection and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases.

    **Title:** Actomyosin-based Cortical Flow: A Computational Model Reveals the Role of Local Remodeling in Stress Production and Dissipation

    **Research Question:** How do local remodeling processes, such as cross-link unbinding and filament turnover, influence the production and dissipation of contractile stress in actomyosin networks, and how do these processes shape long-range cortical flow?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model of a cross-linked actomyosin network with active motors, incorporating minimal requirements for contractile stress production and dissipation: asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover. We analyzed how the production and dissipation of network stress depend on cross-link dynamics and filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to determine overall rates of cortical flow.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis predicts that filament turnover is essential for maintaining active stress against external resistance and steady-state flow in response to external stress. Steady-state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τm, then decreases with lifetime above τm. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τc, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on cross-link dynamics. These individual dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity define multiple regimes of steady-state flow.

    **Implications:** Our results provide a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling. Specifically, we predict that when filament lifetimes are shorter than both τc and τm, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady-state stress on filament turnover cancel each other, such that flow speed is insensitive to filament turnover and shows a simple dependence on motor activity and cross-link dynamics.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational model reveals the complex interplay between force production and dissipation in actomyosin networks, and highlights the importance of local remodeling processes in shaping cortical flow. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cellular morphogenesis and have implications for understanding the regulation of cortical flow in animal cells.

    **Title:** Identification of a Novel Sugar-Sensing QTL, GSQ11, in Arabidopsis thaliana: Insights into Sugar Signaling Pathways

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic mechanisms underlying sugar sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, and how do they interact with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways?

    **Methods:** A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on a Col/C24 F2 population of Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genetic loci associated with seedling sensitivity to high sugar concentrations. Selective genotyping and near-isogenic lines (NILs) were used to confirm the presence of a glucose and fructose-sensing QTL, GSQ11.

    **Main Findings:** GSQ11 was mapped to the ANAC060 gene, which encodes an Arabidopsis NAC family transcription factor. Allelism tests and transgenic complementation revealed that the Col ANAC060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. Genomic and mRNA analyses showed that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Col ANAC060 affects the splicing patterns of ANAC060, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the transmembrane domain (TMD). The absence of the TMD leads to the nuclear localization of ANAC060, which reduces ABA sensitivity and Glc-induced ABA accumulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient expression analysis showed that ABI4 directly binds to the GSQ11/ANAC060 promoter to activate transcription.

    **Implications:** The sugar-ABA signaling cascade induces ANAC060 expression, but the truncated Col ANAC060 protein attenuates ABA induction and ABA signaling, resulting in sugar insensitivity. This negative feedback from nuclear ANAC060 on ABA signaling provides a novel mechanism for regulating sugar sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana.

    **Conclusions:** This study identifies a novel sugar-sensing QTL, GSQ11, and provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying sugar sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings highlight the complex interactions between sugar signaling pathways and ABA signaling, and demonstrate the importance of natural variation analysis in understanding complex biological processes.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Molecular Basis of Cyclic di-GMP Signaling Specificity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

    **Background:** Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a eubacterial nucleotide second messenger that regulates various cellular behaviors, including the transition from planktonic cells to biofilm communities. The multiplicity of c-di-GMP control modules and regulated cellular functions raises the question of signaling specificity.

    **Research Question:** Are c-di-GMP signaling routes exclusively dependent on a central hub or can they be locally administered?

    **Methods:** We investigated the molecular basis of c-di-GMP signaling specificity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We identified a c-di-GMP synthase gene, hsbD, in the proximity of the hptB and flagellar genes cluster.

    **Main Findings:** We show that the HptB pathway controls biofilm formation and motility by involving both HsbD and the anti-anti-sigma factor HsbA. The rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade relies on the original interaction between HsbD and HsbA and on the control of HsbD dynamic localization at the cell poles. We also demonstrate that HsbD and SadC, another c-di-GMP synthase, act at distinct positions in the c-di-GMP network that controls P. aeruginosa behavior.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide an original example of how a single DGC (diganylate cyclase) achieves specificity of action through interaction with a molecular network regulating important P. aeruginosa behaviors. We propose a local action of HsbD at the cell pole and present evidence on how two DGCs, HsbD and SadC, intersect within the same global regulatory network (Gac/Rsm) in a hierarchical order.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of c-di-GMP signaling specificity in P. aeruginosa, where HsbD and SadC act at distinct positions in the c-di-GMP network to control biofilm formation, motility, and chemotaxis. The rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade highlights the complexity and plasticity of c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of c-di-GMP signaling and its role in regulating bacterial behavior.

    **Title:** Learning Multiple Visuomotor Mappings: An Investigation of Associative Learning and Generalization

    **Research Question:** Can humans learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings when feedback for each is provided alternately, and can learned context cues associated with each mapping be used to switch between the stored mappings? Furthermore, how does learning generalize to novel but similar conditions?

    **Methods:** In this study, participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while visual feedback was manipulated with horizontal offsets of different amounts, dependent on the target shape. The target shapes were taken from a continuous set of shapes, morphed between spiky and circular shapes. After training, participants' performance was tested without feedback on different target shapes that had not been learned previously.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that participants can learn the associations between previously irrelevant target shape cues and behaviorally relevant visuomotor mappings. Although learning the associations requires explicit awareness of the cues' role, participants apply the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that is most similar to the current one, consistent with a Bayesian learning model. Furthermore, the Bayesian learning model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the present results.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that humans can learn multiple visuomotor mappings when feedback for each is provided alternately, and that learned context cues associated with each mapping can be used to switch between the stored mappings. The results also indicate that the Bayesian learning model provides a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the associative learning between cue and required visuomotor mapping, and how learning generalizes to novel but similar conditions. The findings have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visuomotor learning and adaptation, and may have practical applications in fields such as robotics and rehabilitation. Overall, this study demonstrates that humans can learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings when feedback for each is provided alternately, and that learned context cues can be used to switch between the stored mappings.

    **Title:** Investigating the Factors Determining Climbing Fiber Burst Size in the Inferior Olivary Nucleus

    **Research Question:** What factors contribute to the size of climbing fiber bursts in the inferior olivary nucleus, and how do they relate to the phase of sub-threshold membrane potential oscillations in olivary cells?

    **Methods:** We employed a detailed three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell to investigate the possible factors determining the size of climbing fiber bursts. We simulated a 5 Hz sinusoidal sub-threshold oscillation of the membrane potential by injecting a corresponding sinusoidal current and compared the results to control experiments where the cell received no such current injection.

    **Main Findings:** Our findings suggest that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited, and that charge flow between the soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. We also found that cell ensemble synchrony can have a significant effect on the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells.

    **Implications:** These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the transmission of information from the inferior olivary nucleus to the cerebellum. Our findings suggest that the phase of sub-threshold membrane potential oscillations in olivary cells can influence the size of climbing fiber bursts, but only in a limited range of oscillation amplitudes and in coupled cell ensembles of sufficient size. This has important implications for our understanding of how the cerebellum processes temporal information and for the development of computational models of cerebellar learning.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the electrophysiological properties of inferior olivary cells in understanding the transmission of information to the cerebellum. The phase-dependency of climbing fiber burst size and the role of charge flow between the soma and dendrite provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cerebellar function. These findings have implications for the development of more accurate computational models of cerebellar learning and for our understanding of how the cerebellum ensures smooth and well-timed execution of motor tasks.

    **Title:** A Quantitative Mechanistic Model of Human Liver Iron Metabolism Reveals Insights into Regulation and Disease

    **Research Question:** How do the core regulatory components of human liver iron metabolism interact to produce tight regulation, and what are the implications for iron-related disorders?

    **Methods:** A mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and kinetic properties obtained from several publications. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data.

    **Main Findings:** The model was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings, including a time course simulation following an oral dose of iron that recreated the dynamics and time scale of the system's response to iron challenge. A disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was also created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation, providing a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease.

    **Implications:** This model supports and supplements our understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modeling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve our knowledge of this system. The model also highlights the importance of robust systemic and cellular control to maintain safe levels of iron, as iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases.

    **Conclusions:** The present model is the most detailed quantitative mechanistic model of cellular iron metabolism to date, allowing for a comprehensive description of its regulation. It can be used to elucidate the link from genotype to phenotype, as demonstrated here with hereditary haemochromatosis. This computational modeling effort constitutes a clinical translational approach, enabling data from multiple sources to improve our understanding of human iron metabolism. The model's predictions about liver iron regulation should be investigated further, and it provides a valuable tool for identifying valuable drug targets and designing experiments to improve our knowledge of this system.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport: A Coarse-Grained Model of the Nuclear Pore Complex

    Abstract:
    Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) across the nuclear envelope (NE) is a critical process in eukaryotic cells, regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Despite its importance, the transport mechanism remains elusive due to the transient and dynamic nature of the interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and Phe-Gly (FG) repeat domains. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure that incorporates the polymeric nature of FG-repeats and the kap-FG hydrophobic affinity. Our model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is approximately 2.6 ± 0.13 ms, with an inverse Gaussian distribution, and that the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. Notably, the kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. Furthermore, our model reveals that almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport. In contrast, cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs exhibit high permeability to inert cargos, underscoring the defining role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity barrier. These findings provide new insights into the NCT process and highlight the importance of kap-FG interactions and cytoplasmic filaments in regulating transport across the NPC.

    Methods:
    We employed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure, taking into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats and the kap-FG hydrophobic affinity. Brownian dynamics simulations were performed to examine the transport of cargo-complexes of varying sizes (9 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm) through the NPC. The first-passage time and radial probability distribution of the cargo-complex inside the central channel were analyzed to understand the transport mechanism.

    Main Findings:
    Our model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is approximately 2.6 ± 0.13 ms, with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. The kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. Almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the NCT process, highlighting the importance of kap-FG interactions and cytoplasmic filaments in regulating transport across the NPC. The high permeability of cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs to inert cargos underscores the critical role of these filaments in maintaining the selectivity barrier.

    Conclusions:
    Our coarse-grained model of the NPC structure provides a new framework for understanding the NCT process. The dynamic and fast kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is essential for efficient translocation through the NPC, while cytoplasmic filaments play a crucial role in maintaining the selectivity barrier. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of nucleocytoplasmic transport and its regulation in eukaryotic cells.

    **Title:** Optimized Protocol for Determining the 50% Infectious Dose (AID50) in Nonhuman Primate Models

    **Background:** Nonhuman primate (NHP) models are widely used to test interventions against human pathogens, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. However, determining the optimal challenge dose of the infectious agent is critical to the success of these experiments, as using too-high or too-low a dose can lead to false negative results and excessive animal use.

    **Research Question:** Can an optimized protocol be developed to determine the 50% infectious dose (AID50) of a pathogen in NHP models, minimizing animal use and resources while providing an accurate estimate of the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value?

    **Methods:** The proposed protocol involves iterative exposures of cohorts of one or more animals to a dilution of the pathogen stock, adjusting the dose between each round to achieve 50% infection. The relationship between the probability of infection (P) and the challenge dose (D) is used to inform dose adjustments.

    **Main Findings:** The optimized protocol requires an average of 15 animals (range: 12-25), 3 phase 1 rounds (range: 2-5), and results in an estimate of the AID50 within 40% of the true value. This protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but is most critical for NHP models, where ethical considerations mandate minimization of animal use.

    **Implications:** The optimized protocol minimizes animal use and resources while providing an accurate estimate of the AID50, reducing the risk of false negative results and excessive animal use. This protocol can be applied to various pathogens and animal models, making it a valuable tool for researchers working with NHP models.

    **Conclusions:** The optimized protocol for determining the AID50 in NHP models is a significant advancement in the field, enabling researchers to achieve statistically significant and biologically meaningful results while minimizing animal use and resources. By following this protocol, investigators can ensure the success of their experiments and contribute to the development of effective interventions against human pathogens.

    **Title:** Adaptation of the Auditory Neuron AN2 in Crickets: A Novel Form of Sensory Adaptation

    **Research Question:** How does the auditory neuron AN2 in crickets adapt to changes in the sensory environment, particularly in response to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli, and what are the implications for signal representation?

    **Methods:** We investigated the response properties of the first-order auditory interneuron AN2 in crickets to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli using electrophysiological recordings. We characterized the response of AN2 to stimuli with two or three peaks in their amplitude distributions and compared the results with the predictions of two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding.

    **Main Findings:** We found that adaptation shifts the stimulus-response curves of AN2 toward higher stimulus intensities, with a time constant of 1.5 s for adaptation and recovery. The spike responses were reduced for low-intensity sounds. Using Bayesian data analysis, we quantified the shifts of the measured response curves and found a slight reduction of their slopes. Notably, adaptation actually reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals, contradicting the infomax principle. The response curve changes were also not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis, as the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal remained nearly constant.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the auditory neuron AN2 in crickets adapts to changes in the sensory environment by shifting the stimulus-response curve toward higher stimulus intensities. This adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information, particularly for low-intensity sounds. These results have implications for our understanding of sensory processing in the cricket auditory system and challenge the infomax principle, which predicts that adaptation should maximize the information conveyed about the entire signal range.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel form of adaptation in the auditory neuron AN2 of crickets, characterized by a time constant of 1.5 s. The adaptation of AN2 reduces the amount of encoded information, particularly for low-intensity sounds, contradicting the infomax principle. These findings highlight the complexity of sensory processing in the cricket auditory system and emphasize the need for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying sensory adaptation.

    **Title:** Polybasic Domains of Cellular Prion Protein Are Not Essential for Prion Propagation: A Novel Interaction Mechanism Revealed

    **Research Question:** Do polybasic domains of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) play a crucial role in the propagation of disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc)?

    **Methods:** We generated prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and used them as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) reactions. We also used a novel magnetic capture assay to investigate the binding of PrPC polybasic domains to PrPSc.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PrPSc molecules lacking the central polybasic domain (ΔC) can bind to and induce the conversion of all polybasic domain mutant substrates into PrPSc molecules. Notably, ΔC-PrPSc prions displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild-type PrPSc, despite their ability to seed sPMCA reactions of normal mouse brain homogenate.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism, and that normal PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity. Our results also provide the first example of dissociation between normal brain homogenate sPMCA seeding ability and biological prion infectivity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel interaction mechanism between PrPC and PrPSc, where ΔC-PrPSc prions can interact with PrPC molecules through a polybasic domain-independent mechanism, yielding an expanded substrate range and highly efficient PrPSc propagation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of prion biology and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prion diseases.

    **Title:** Inverse Reinforcement-Learning Framework Reveals Thermotactic Strategies in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** How do Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) animals control their behavioral patterns to reach a desired state in an environment, and what are the underlying neural mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify the behavioral strategy of C. elegans from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior, where worms were cultivated at a constant temperature with or without food and then placed on a thermal gradient.

    **Main Findings:** Our IRL approach revealed that fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative to control their behavior, which involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). DM allowed worms to efficiently reach specific temperatures, explaining their thermotactic behavior when fed, while IM involved moving along a constant temperature, reflecting isothermal tracking. In contrast, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute temperature, but not its temporal derivative. We also applied our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms to investigate the neural basis underlying these strategies.

    **Implications:** Our IRL-based approach provides a novel method for identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data, which can be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making in other organisms. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering both absolute and temporal temperature information in understanding thermotactic behavior in C. elegans.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of IRL in dissecting the neural mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, such as thermotaxis in C. elegans. Our results provide new insights into the decision-making processes of animals and have implications for understanding the neural basis of behavior in other organisms. The IRL framework developed in this study can be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, enabling a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying animal behavior.

    **Title:** Draft Genome Sequence of Chrysochromulina tobin and Insights into Haptophyte Evolution, Ecology, and Economic Importance

    **Research Question:** What is the draft genome sequence of Chrysochromulina tobin, a haptophyte species, and how does it contribute to our understanding of haptophyte evolution, ecology, and economic importance?

    **Methods:** We sequenced the nuclear genome of Chrysochromulina tobin, a member of the Prymnesiales clade, and collected transcriptome data at seven time points over a 24-hour light/dark cycle.

    **Main Findings:** The C. tobin genome is small (59 Mb), compact (∼40% of the genome is protein coding), and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression over the circadian photoperiod. The C. tobin genome harbors the first hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex reported for an algal species, and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin was also identified, together with two “red” RuBisCO activases shared across many algal lineages.

    **Implications:** The C. tobin genome sequence provides new information on the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes. Genomic studies of haptophytes will enhance commercial endeavors targeting aquaculture feed stocks, nutraceuticals, plastics, or biofuel production. Additionally, genomic knowledge of haptophytes will support efforts to understand the fundamental metabolic processes associated with the genesis of harmful algal bloom events.

    **Conclusions:** The C. tobin genome represents the second haptophyte whose genomes (nuclear and organellar) have been sequenced. The nuclear genome is small, compact, gene-rich, and provides evidence of lateral gene transfer events that have contributed to the evolutionary restructuring of this taxon. The C. tobin genome has provided a wealth of new information on the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes, highlighting the significance of these algae in aquatic ecosystems and their potential applications in various industries.
Title: Concomitant Inactivation of Rb, p53, and Brca1 Pathways in Mammary Epithelium Predisposes Highly Penetrant, Metastatic Adenocarcinomas

    Abstract:

    Background: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. These cancers often belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype and are associated with defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways.

    Research Question: What is the effect of concomitant inactivation of Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways in mammary epithelium on tumor latency and predisposition to metastatic adenocarcinomas?

    Methods: We used mouse genetic studies to investigate the effects of combined inactivation of Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways in mammary epithelium.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that concomitant inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. The tumors exhibit poor differentiation, heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis, characteristics common among human Brca1-mutated tumors. Gene expression analyses reveal that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that concomitant inactivation of Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways in mammary epithelium is a critical event in the development of highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. Mouse models that mimic the complexity of TNBC will be invaluable tools for defining the diverse cellular biology and behavior of these tumors and for rigorously triaging new drug candidates.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of concomitant inactivation of Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways in the development of aggressive forms of breast cancer. These findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC and for the development of targeted therapies.

    **Title:** Spatial Density of Larval Development Sites Influences Aedes aegypti Population Dynamics in Rural Thailand

    **Research Question:** How does the spatial density of larval development sites affect the distribution and abundance of Aedes aegypti pupae in rural Thailand?

    **Methods:** Pupal surveys were conducted from 2004 to 2007 in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand. A total of 84,840 samples of water-holding containers were used to estimate model parameters. Regression modeling was employed to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. A varying-coefficients model was used to account for the large differences in productivity between container types, and a two-part modeling structure, called a hurdle model, was used to account for the large number of zeroes and overdispersion present in pupal population counts.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Aedes aegypti pupae. The productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. This suggests that an ecological approach, accounting for development site density, is essential for predicting Aedes aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the spatial density of larval development sites in predicting Aedes aegypti population dynamics. This knowledge can inform the design of effective vector control programs, which are critical for preventing and curtailing dengue transmission until an effective vaccine is licensed and widely administered. By accounting for development site density, public health interventions can be targeted more effectively, reducing the risk of dengue outbreaks.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the value of an ecological approach to understanding Aedes aegypti population dynamics. By incorporating development site density into vector control efforts, we can develop more effective and sustainable strategies for preventing dengue transmission. Further research is needed to integrate this knowledge with other ecological and epidemiological factors to develop a comprehensive understanding of Aedes aegypti ecology and inform the design of increasingly effective vector interventions.

    **Title:** TORC2 Integrates Feeding State and Environmental Cues to Regulate Developmental and Behavioral Decisions in C. elegans

    **Research Question:** How does the conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) coordinate larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state in the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic, molecular, and behavioral approaches to investigate the role of TORC2 in regulating developmental and behavioral decisions in C. elegans. We analyzed the expression of the daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide genes in sensory neurons in response to pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature. We also examined the effects of TORC2 activity in the intestine on neuronal expression of these genes and on adult foraging behaviors.

    **Main Findings:** We found that TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of daf-7 and daf-28, which together reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status. This integration of food signals with external cues modulates neuroendocrine gene expression and promotes a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. In the adult, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway. We also identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, thereby contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state. This integration of internal and external cues allows C. elegans to make informed decisions about development and behavior in response to changing environmental conditions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the integration of feeding state and environmental cues in C. elegans. The identification of TORC2 as a key regulator of this process has important implications for our understanding of how animals make decisions about development and behavior in response to their internal and external environment.

    Title: Systematic Identification of Transcriptional Regulatory Motifs in Pluripotent Cells

    Background: Understanding the transcriptional regulation of pluripotent cells is crucial for directing the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and reprogramming somatic cells.

    Research Question: What are the transcriptional regulatory motifs that control gene expression in pluripotent cells?

    Methods: We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and primordial germ cells and identified genes upregulated in pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. We developed a novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, which combines sequence alignment and probabilistic segmentation to predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression.

    Main Findings: We identified conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, which are enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. These motifs are preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner and can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter. Importantly, the activity of the motifs is conserved in human ES cells.

    Implications: Our results provide novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggest that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.

    Conclusions: We report the identification of clusters of genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, the development of a novel algorithm for discovery of short cis-acting regulatory motifs, the validation of the activity of several novel motifs in mouse and human pluripotent stem cells, and the identification of transcription factor NF-Y as a regulator of gene expression in ES cells that is required for their proliferation. Our results provide a basis for understanding the transcriptional regulatory networks that underlie early mammalian embryogenesis and ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency. This study highlights the importance of a systematic approach to understanding the complex regulatory networks that control gene expression in pluripotent cells.

    **Title:** Structural Characterization of the Nucleoprotein-Phosphoprotein Complex in Non-Segmented Negative-Strand RNA Viruses

    **Research Question:** How does the nucleoprotein (N) interact with the phosphoprotein (P) to facilitate replication of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses?

    **Methods:** We generated a soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) encompassing the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P that binds RNA-free N (N0). The complex was crystallized and solved at 3.0 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography.

    **Main Findings:** The crystal structure of the NΔ21-P60 complex reveals a decameric circular form, where the MoRE of P folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy experiments confirm the binding of the MoRE and indicate that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that the reconstituted NΔ21-P60 complex is a suitable model for the viral N0-P complex. The MoRE of P, which adopts a stable conformation upon binding to N, includes residues 6 to 35 and corresponds closely to the fragment previously identified as essential and sufficient for maintaining N in a soluble form. The heterodimer NΔ21-P60 crystallized into a circular decamer of heterodimers, revealing the molecular mechanisms by which the N0-binding MoRE of P attaches to N.

    **Conclusions:** Our structural characterization of the NΔ21-P60 complex provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the replication of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The results suggest a mechanism for the encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA and the initiation of RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. These findings have implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting the N-P interaction, which is essential for viral replication.

    **Title:** Efficient Encoding of Sensory Stimuli by Axonal Gap Junctions in the Fly Visual System

    **Research Question:** How do axonal gap junctions contribute to the efficient encoding of sensory information in the fly visual system?

    **Methods:** We employed an information-theoretical analysis of a realistic model of the vertical system (VS) network in the fly visual system to investigate the role of axonal gap junctions in encoding the axis of rotation (θ) of the fly’s ego motion. We simulated the VS network with and without axonal gap junctions and measured the encoding efficiency in bits.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation (θ) of the fly’s ego motion within 10 ms following the onset of visual input. The encoding efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. Furthermore, we found that a subpopulation of triplets of VS cells, connected to downstream pathways via axonal gap junctions, encodes motion more efficiently than the whole VS network and is robust to a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli. The findings suggest that axonal gap junctions play a crucial role in improving information transmission in the fly visual system, which may be a common mechanism in other neuronal systems. The efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously appreciated based on point neuron models. The presence of axonal gap junctions in the VS network enables efficient encoding of sensory stimuli, which is essential for the fly's visually guided behavior. These findings encourage the exploration of gap junctions as a common mechanism for improving information transmission in other neuronal systems.

    **Title:** Tyrosine Sulfation of PSGL-1 Facilitates Enterovirus 71 Entry and Replication in Leukocytes

    **Background:** Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children, and has been associated with various neurological diseases, including fatal cases in large outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region. Recent studies have identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry and replication in leukocytes.

    **Research Question:** To elucidate the molecular basis of the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction, we aimed to identify the post-translational modifications critical for PSGL-1 binding to EV71.

    **Methods:** We generated a series of PSGL-1 mutants and expressed them in 293T cells. The transfected cells were assayed for their abilities to bind to EV71 by flow cytometry. We also used site-directed mutagenesis and an inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, to investigate the role of tyrosine sulfation and O-glycosylation in PSGL-1 binding to EV71.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 is critical for EV71 binding to PSGL-1 and for virus entry and replication in Jurkat T cells. We found that a PSGL-1 mutant with an alanine substitution at the potential O-glycosylation site (T57) still bound to EV71 in a calcium-independent manner. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis at one or more potential tyrosine sulfation sites in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 significantly impaired PSGL-1 binding to EV71. Furthermore, an inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction and inhibited PSGL-1-mediated viral replication of EV71 in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of EV71 entry and replication in leukocytes and highlight the importance of tyrosine sulfation in PSGL-1 binding to EV71. These results have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat EV71 infections.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 is critical for EV71 binding to PSGL-1 and for virus entry and replication in leukocytes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the structural basis of the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction and to identify genetic determinants in EV71 capsid proteins required for PSGL-1 binding.
Title: Therapeutic Efficacy of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors in Experimental Cutaneous Leishmaniasis

    Abstract:
    Leishmaniasis is a significant global health burden, with limited treatment options due to drug toxicity and emerging resistance. This study investigates the therapeutic efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in controlling Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice. We evaluated the effects of rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794 on footpad swelling, parasite burden, cytokine production, and phenotypic changes in draining lymph node cells. Our results show that treatment with clinically relevant doses of rapamycin or GSK-2126458 significantly reduced footpad swelling and parasite load, while KU-0063794 had no effect. Notably, rapamycin did not exhibit direct anti-parasitic activity in vitro. Instead, it modulated the immune response by reducing IL-4 production and increasing the IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio, indicative of a T helper-type 1 (Th1)-skewed cytokine profile. Furthermore, rapamycin enhanced the expression of CD69, an early activation marker, on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be used in therapeutic settings for the management of leishmaniasis. The immunomodulatory properties of these inhibitors may also be exploited in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.

    Research Question:
    Can mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors effectively control Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice?

    Methods:
    BALB/c mice were infected with Leishmania major via intrafootpad injection and treated with rapamycin, GSK-2126458, or KU-0063794. Footpad swelling and parasite burden were assessed, and cytokine production by mouse splenocytes and phenotypic changes in draining lymph node cells were evaluated.

    Main Findings:
    Treatment with clinically relevant doses of rapamycin or GSK-2126458 significantly reduced footpad swelling and parasite load, while KU-0063794 had no effect. Rapamycin did not exhibit direct anti-parasitic activity in vitro but modulated the immune response by reducing IL-4 production and increasing the IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio. The expression of CD69, an early activation marker, was enhanced on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be used in therapeutic settings for the management of leishmaniasis. The immunomodulatory properties of these inhibitors may also be exploited in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in controlling Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice. The observed benefits are attributed to the immunomodulatory properties of these inhibitors, which modulate the immune response and promote a T helper-type 1 (Th1)-skewed cytokine profile. Further research is needed to explore the potential of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of leishmaniasis.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanism of Natural Transformation in Neisseria Species: The Role of ComP and DUS

    **Research Question:** What is the functional interdependence between the DNA uptake sequence (DUS) and its receptor, ComP, in the natural transformation process of Neisseria species?

    **Methods:** We employed a series of experiments to investigate the impact of ComP on transformation in the presence and absence of DUS, the importance of DUS and its bases for transformation and recognition by ComP, the ability of naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals to transform N. meningitidis, and the ability of a ComP homolog in one of these commensals to mediate DUS-enhanced transformation in a comP mutant of N. meningitidis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ComP is essential for transformation in both the presence and absence of DUS, and that the inner bases of DUS (7-10) are critical for recognition by ComP and hence transformation. We also found that naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals, differing from DUS by only one or two bases, are similarly impaired for transformation of N. meningitidis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a ComP homolog from N. subflava commensal specifically binds its cognate DUS variant and mediates DUS-enhanced transformation when expressed in a comP mutant of N. meningitidis.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveal an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche. The identification of ComP as the DUS receptor in Neisseria species paves the way for a detailed functional analysis of the DUS-ComP interdependence during natural transformation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanism of natural transformation in Neisseria species and highlights the importance of ComP and DUS in this process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of horizontal gene transfer and the evolution of bacterial populations, particularly in the context of human pathogens like N. meningitidis.

    **Title:** Cooperation between Pxl1 and Bgs1 is essential for contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) anchorage and septum formation during cytokinesis in fission yeast.

    **Research Question:** How do Pxl1 and Bgs1 interact to form the septum during cytokinesis in fission yeast?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genetic study using fission yeast to investigate the cooperation between Pxl1, a paxillin homolog required for ring integrity, and Bgs1, the enzyme responsible for linear β(1,3) glucan synthesis and primary septum formation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that cooperation between Pxl1 and Bgs1 is necessary for stable anchorage of the CAR to the plasma membrane before septation onset and for cleavage furrow formation. Depletion of Bgs1 in combination with Pxl1 deficiency causes failure of ring contraction and lateral cell wall overgrowth towards the cell lumen without septum formation. We also found that Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis and that this increase depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. Furthermore, Bgs1 depletion in cells carrying a cdc15ΔSH3 allele causes ring disassembly and septation blockage, similar to cells lacking Pxl1.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane through Cdc15 and Pxl1, and concomitant Bgs1 activity, are necessary for CAR maintenance and septum formation in fission yeast. We propose that Pxl1 acts as a mechanosensor that helps to transform the CAR contraction into an activation signal for the biosynthetic enzymes that form the septum.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that Pxl1 and Bgs1 cooperate to maintain the position and integrity of the CAR during cytokinesis and are together essential for the synthesis of the entire septum structure. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cytokinesis in fission yeast and highlight the importance of Pxl1 and Bgs1 in septum formation.

    **Title:** Investigating the Outbreak Dynamics of Glanders in Bahrain: A Phylogenetic Analysis of Burkholderia mallei Isolates

    **Background:** Glanders, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia mallei, has re-emerged in various regions worldwide, including Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. Despite its rarity, understanding the outbreak dynamics and epidemiology of glanders is crucial for effective disease control and prevention.

    **Research Question:** What is the phylogenetic relationship between Burkholderia mallei isolates from a recent outbreak in Bahrain and those from a previous outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in 2004?

    **Methods:** We employed high-resolution genotyping using multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats (MLVA) and comparative whole-genome sequencing to analyze B. mallei isolates from infected horses and a camel in Bahrain. These results were compared to samples from the 2004 UAE outbreak and placed into a broader phylogeographic context based on previously published B. mallei data.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed two distinct clusters of B. mallei isolates from the Bahrain outbreak, suggesting a complex epidemiological background and evidence for the involvement of multiple B. mallei strains. The samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the UAE in 2004 than other B. mallei, indicating repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the recent emergence of glanders in combination with worldwide horse trading poses a new risk for human infections. The close relationship between the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations may indicate a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that the recent outbreak in Bahrain was caused by two different B. mallei strains, suggesting two independent introductions. Animal importation records suggest Syria and Kuwait as possible sources, which is supported by the fact that one of the necropsied horses in Bahrain quarantine came directly from Kuwait. Our results highlight the importance of understanding outbreak dynamics and natural genetic variability of B. mallei to inform disease control and prevention strategies.
Title: Investigating Treatment Failure in American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Caused by Leishmania braziliensis: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study

    Abstract:
    American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a significant public health concern, with approximately 67,000 new cases reported annually. Leishmania braziliensis is the primary causative agent, but species confirmation is often not feasible. The first-line treatment for ACL caused by L. braziliensis is pentavalent antimonial derivatives, such as Glucantime or Sodium Stibogluconate, administered systemically. However, treatment failure rates are high, with approximately 25% of patients not responding to Glucantime. This cross-sectional observational study aimed to characterize the clinical and parasitological features of patients with ACL who did not respond to Glucantime.

    Methods:
    A convenience sample of 43 patients with ACL, recruited from three Colombian Army National reference centers, were included in the study. Patients had completed at least one round of treatment with Glucantime and experienced treatment failure or relapse. Clinical and paraclinical examinations, as well as epidemiological and geographic information, were recorded for each patient. Parasitological, histopathological, and PCR infection confirmation were performed, and Glucantime IC50 and in vitro infectivity for the isolated parasites were estimated.

    Main Findings:
    L. braziliensis was the predominant infecting species (95.4%), and 35% of the parasites isolated showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility associated with previous administration of the medicament. Lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite were negatively correlated with decline in Glucantime susceptibility (Spearman: r = -0.548 and r = -0.726, respectively). A negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance was also documented. L. braziliensis was found to be the main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that L. braziliensis is the primary causative agent of treatment failure in ACL, and that previous administration of Glucantime may contribute to the development of parasite resistance. The results also indicate that lesion size and parasite infectivity are negatively correlated with Glucantime susceptibility. These findings have significant implications for the treatment of ACL, particularly in regions where L. braziliensis is prevalent.

    Conclusions:
    This study highlights the need for alternative treatment strategies for ACL caused by L. braziliensis, particularly for patients who have previously received Glucantime. The results suggest that a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonial derivatives may not be effective, and alternative therapies should be explored. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of parasite resistance and to develop more effective treatments for ACL.
Title: Functional Interchangeability of 4′-Phosphopantetheinyl Transferases in the Biosynthesis of Siderophores and Colibactin in Escherichia coli

    Abstract:
    In Escherichia coli, the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores (enterobactin, salmochelins, and yersiniabactin) and a genotoxin (colibactin) require a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). Two PPTases, EntD and ClbA, have been identified, with EntD being part of the core genome and ClbA encoded on the pks pathogenicity island. We investigated the potential interplay between the synthesis pathways of siderophores and colibactin through functional interchangeability between EntD and ClbA. Our results demonstrate that ClbA can contribute to siderophore synthesis and that inactivation of both entD and clbA abolishes the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) in a mouse sepsis model. The presence of either functional EntD or ClbA is required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo. This is the first report demonstrating a connection between multiple phosphopantetheinyl-requiring pathways leading to the biosynthesis of functionally distinct secondary metabolites in a given microorganism. We hypothesize that the strict association of the pks island with the high pathogenicity island (HPI) has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores. Our findings highlight the complex regulatory interaction of various virulence features with different functions and suggest that the identification of key points of these networks is essential for understanding ExPEC virulence and developing anti-virulence therapy strategies.

    Research Question:
    What is the functional relationship between the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and colibactin in Escherichia coli, and how do 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) contribute to these pathways?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the functional interchangeability of EntD and ClbA in the biosynthesis of siderophores and colibactin in E. coli. We inactivated the entE gene, which encodes the ligase component of the synthase multienzyme complex necessary for enterobactin biosynthesis, and demonstrated that ClbA can contribute to siderophore synthesis. We also inactivated both entD and clbA and showed that this abolishes the virulence of ExPEC in a mouse sepsis model.

    Main Findings:
    Our results demonstrate that ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of colibactin, yersiniabactin, enterobactin, and salmochelins. Inactivation of both entD and clbA abolishes the virulence of ExPEC in a mouse sepsis model, and the presence of either functional EntD or ClbA is required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the complex regulatory interaction of various virulence features with different functions and suggest that the identification of key points of these networks is essential for understanding ExPEC virulence and developing anti-virulence therapy strategies.

    Conclusions:
    We have demonstrated a connection between multiple phosphopantetheinyl-requiring pathways leading to the biosynthesis of functionally distinct secondary metabolites in E. coli. Our results suggest that the strict association of the pks island with the HPI has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA is a promisc
Title: A Probabilistic Model of Multiple Sequence Alignment Accounting for Insertions and Deletions in Phylogenetic Tree Inference

    Abstract:
    The calculation of the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model is a fundamental task in sequence analysis. However, existing phylogenetic models only account for residue substitution events, neglecting insertions and deletions. We present a novel probabilistic model of multiple sequence alignment that incorporates insertions and deletions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. Our model assumes a non-reversible generative (birth–death) evolutionary process for insertions and deletions, occurring one residue at a time. We extend the program dnaml in phylip to apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference. Using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new "concordance test" benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments, we demonstrate that the extended program dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.

    Research Question:
    Can a probabilistic model of multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertions and deletions improve the accuracy of phylogenetic tree inference compared to existing models that only account for residue substitution events?

    Methods:
    We constructed a non-reversible generative (birth–death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. We extended the program dnaml in phylip to apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference. We evaluated the performance of the extended program dnamlε using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new "concordance test" benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the extended program dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm. The model accurately infers phylogenetic tree topologies for simulated alignment data with insertions and deletions from arbitrarily generated trees. Furthermore, the model correctly infers phylogenetic trees on real ribosomal RNA data.

    Implications:
    The incorporation of insertions and deletions into phylogenetic models has significant implications for the accuracy of phylogenetic tree inference. By accounting for these events, our model provides a more realistic representation of sequence evolution, leading to improved accuracy in phylogenetic tree inference.

    Conclusions:
    We present a novel probabilistic model of multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertions and deletions in phylogenetic tree inference. Our results demonstrate the improved accuracy of this model compared to existing models that only account for residue substitution events. The extended program dnamlε provides a valuable tool for phylogenetic tree inference, offering a more realistic representation of sequence evolution and improved accuracy in phylogenetic tree inference.

    **Title:** Human Epidermal Langerhans Cells Initiate Immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus by Transferring Antigen to Dermal Dendritic Cells

    **Research Question:** How do human epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) initiate immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) by interacting with dermal dendritic cells (DCs)?

    **Methods:** This study used a combination of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches to investigate the interaction between LCs and dermal DCs in human skin. HSV-1 infected human foreskin explants, biopsies of initial human genital herpes lesions, and isolated LCs and dermal DCs were used to examine the transfer of viral antigen from infected LCs to dermal DCs.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that LCs are initially infected by HSV-1 and undergo apoptosis, leading to the formation of large cell clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs (equivalent to murine CD103+ dermal DCs) and DC-SIGN+ DCs/macrophages in the dermis. HSV-expressing LC fragments were observed inside dermal DCs/macrophages, and BDCA3+ dermal DCs had up-regulated the damaged cell uptake receptor CLEC9A. Correspondingly, LCs isolated from human skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro also underwent apoptosis and were taken up by similarly isolated BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that a viral antigen relay takes place where HSV-infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken up by dermal DCs for subsequent antigen presentation. This provides a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal HSV immunization.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that human epidermal LCs play a crucial role in initiating immunity to HSV by transferring viral antigen to dermal DCs. This process involves the formation of cell clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ DCs/macrophages, leading to the presentation of HSV antigen to T cells in the lymph nodes and dermis. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel immunization strategies against HSV and other epithelia-tropic viruses.
Title: Comparative Analysis of Parasitophorous Vacuole Biogenesis in Macrophages Infected with Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis Amastigotes

    Abstract:
    The biogenesis of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) is a critical aspect of intracellular parasitism, particularly in the context of Leishmania infections. This study aimed to elucidate the differences in PV biogenesis between Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes in primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Using multidimensional imaging of live cells and the lysosomotropic fluorescent probe Lysotracker, we characterized the dynamic features of PV biogenesis in macrophages infected with either L. major or L. amazonensis amastigotes. Our results show that L. major amastigotes are housed in tight-fitting, fission-prone PVs, whereas L. amazonensis amastigotes reside in giant PVs. We observed three key features of Leishmania amastigote-hosting PVs: (i) the entry of Lysotracker transients within tight-fitting, fission-prone L. major amastigote-housing PVs; (ii) the decrease in the number of macrophage acidic vesicles during L. major PV fission or L. amazonensis PV enlargement; and (iii) the L. amazonensis PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. These findings provide new insights into the species-specific differences in PV biogenesis and remodeling, which may be useful for understanding the biology of other intracellular microorganisms. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of using live cell imaging to overcome the limitations of fixed cell preparations and to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic processes involved in PV biogenesis.

    **Research Question:** How does chromatin structure contribute to the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in immunoglobulin gene diversification?

    **Methods:** We employed a regulatable experimental system in the chicken B cell line DT40, where the heterochromatin protein HP1 (Drosophila melanogaster Su[var]205) was expressed as a fusion to Escherichia coli lactose repressor (LacI-HP1) and tethered to polymerized lactose operators integrated within the pseudo-Vλ donor array.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. Tethering HP1 to the pseudo-Vλ array diminished histone acetylation and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, resulting in a predominance of nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations. These results demonstrate that chromatin structure regulates homology-directed repair.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. This has practical ramifications for developing strategies that harness a cell's capacity for homology-dependent repair to promote gene therapy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides direct evidence that chromatin structure plays a crucial role in regulating homology-directed repair in immunoglobulin gene diversification. The tethering of HP1 to the pseudo-Vλ array altered the chromatin structure, leading to a decrease in histone acetylation and an increase in nontemplated mutations. These results highlight the importance of chromatin structure in regulating homologous recombination and suggest that permissive structure at the donor will be an important design parameter in developing donor genes for therapeutic applications. Furthermore, our findings have implications for understanding how chromatin structure affects gene conversion and homologous recombination more generally.
Title: Revisiting the Role of Climbing Fibers in Cerebellum-Based Motor Learning: Evidence for Error Memory in Saccadic Adaptation

    Abstract:
    The cerebellum plays a crucial role in adjusting motor behavior to meet the demands of a given situation. Traditionally, it has been assumed that cerebellum-based motor learning is guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, with error information driving lasting changes in parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells (PCs). Climbing fibers, originating from the inferior olive, are thought to convey instant error information for synaptic modification, but not to contribute to error memory. Here, we investigated the role of climbing fibers in saccadic learning using a random error saccadic adaptation paradigm in monkeys. Our results reveal a clear complex spike (CS) signature of the error at the time of its occurrence, as well as a reverberation of this signature much later, before a new manifestation of the behavior. This finding suggests that climbing fibers may play a more significant role in error memory than previously thought.

    Methods:
    We used a random error saccadic adaptation paradigm to study cerebellum-based motor learning in monkeys. This paradigm allowed us to avoid the gradual buildup of strong behavioral changes and the accompanying diminution of the error, which can obscure the electrophysiological fingerprint of the original error.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show a clear CS signature of the error at the time of its occurrence, as well as a reverberation of this signature much later, before a new manifestation of the behavior. This suggests that climbing fibers may play a more significant role in error memory than previously thought.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of cerebellum-based motor learning. They suggest that climbing fibers may not only convey instant error information but also contribute to error memory, allowing for lasting changes in behavior. This challenges the traditional view of the role of climbing fibers in cerebellum-based motor learning.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the role of climbing fibers in cerebellum-based motor learning. The results suggest that climbing fibers may play a more significant role in error memory than previously thought, and that they may contribute to lasting changes in behavior. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying cerebellum-based motor learning and the role of climbing fibers in this process.

    **Title:** Hsp40 Chaperone Sis1 and its Mammalian Homologue DNAJB1 Exert Neuroprotective Effects in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

    **Background:** Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons and the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates containing the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43. Using a yeast model of ALS, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying TDP-43 toxicity and identified potential therapeutic targets.

    **Research Question:** Can the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1 and its mammalian homologue DNAJB1 mitigate TDP-43 toxicity and aggregation in yeast and mammalian neurons?

    **Methods:** We employed a yeast model of ALS exhibiting TDP-43 dependent toxicity and overexpressed TDP-43 in yeast and primary rodent cortical neurons. We also overexpressed Sis1 and its mammalian homologue DNAJB1 to assess their effects on TDP-43 toxicity and aggregation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that TDP-43 overexpression dramatically alters cell shape and reduces ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct in yeast. Notably, excess Sis1 reduced TDP-43's effect on toxicity, cell shape, and proteolysis. Furthermore, overexpression of DNAJB1, the mammalian Sis1 homologue, relieved TDP-43-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Sis1 and its mammalian homologue DNAJB1 may have neuroprotective effects in ALS by mitigating TDP-43 toxicity and aggregation. The identification of Sis1 as a modifier of TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and DNAJB1 in mammalian neurons highlights the potential of Hsp40 chaperones as therapeutic targets for ALS.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TDP-43 toxicity and identifies Sis1 and DNAJB1 as potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Further research is needed to determine if the protection afforded by Sis1 and DNAJB1 can be an effective means of extending neuronal survival in ALS and related conditions characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of DNA/RNA binding proteins.
Title: Molecular Typing and Parasite Load Quantification of Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units in Chronic Chagas Disease Patients from Brazil

    Abstract:
    Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a significant public health concern in Latin America. This study aimed to investigate the association between Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) and clinical manifestations of the disease in 65 chronic Chagas disease patients from Brazil. We employed a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approaches to perform molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens. Our results showed that 53.8% of patients presented positive amplification by qPCR, with 30.7% having the clinical indeterminate form and 23.1% having the cardiac form of the disease. Notably, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old (median 20.05 [18.29-86.86] parasite equivalents/mL). We were able to genotype the parasite in 80% of patients with positive qPCR, identifying TcVI, TcII, and mixed infection TcVI+TcII in 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3% of patients, respectively. Patients infected by TcII had higher parasite loads (median 7.56 par. Eq./mL) compared to those infected by TcVI (median 2.35 par. Eq./mL). However, patients infected by TcVI had a higher frequency of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) (50%) compared to those infected by TcII (16.7%). Our findings contribute to updating the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the age of the patient and infection by TcII as important factors leading to higher parasitemia levels.

    Methods:
    We recruited 65 chronic Chagas disease patients from a single health center in Brazil, with their place of birth distributed across different geographic regions. Blood samples were collected and processed for serological and molecular diagnosis tests. We used a multilocus conventional PCR and qPCR approaches to perform molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens.

    Main Findings:
    Our results showed that 53.8% of patients presented positive amplification by qPCR, with 30.7% having the clinical indeterminate form and 23.1% having the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old (median 20.05 [18.29-86.86] par. Eq./mL). We were able to genotype the parasite in 80% of patients with positive qPCR, identifying TcVI, TcII, and mixed infection TcVI+TcII in 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3% of patients, respectively. Patients infected by TcII had higher parasite loads (median 7.56 par. Eq./mL) compared to those infected by TcVI (median 2.35 par. Eq./mL).

    Implications:
    Our findings contribute to updating the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the age of the patient and infection by TcII as important factors leading to higher parasitemia levels.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides valuable insights into the molecular typing and parasite load quantification of T. cruzi DTUs in chronic Chagas disease patients from Brazil. Our results suggest that the age of the patient and infection by TcII are important factors leading to higher parasitemia levels, which may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease.

    **Title:** Enhanced Bat Rabies Surveillance in Guatemala Reveals Low Prevalence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Rabies Virus

    **Research Question:** What is the prevalence of rabies virus (RABV) in bats in Guatemala, and what are the phylogenetic relationships of the detected viruses?

    **Methods:** Between 2009 and 2011, a total of 672 bats of 31 species were sampled and tested for RABV in Guatemala as part of a larger pathogen detection program. Viral antigens were detected and infectious virus was isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RABV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, and viral RNA was detected in all tissues examined by hemi-nested RT-PCR.

    **Main Findings:** The prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats was low (0.3%). Two vampire bat RABV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that both viruses were 100% identical, while sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed one non-synonymous substitution (302T, S). Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody.

    **Implications:** The low prevalence of RABV in bats in Guatemala suggests that the virus may not be as widespread as previously thought. However, the detection of RABV exposure among multiple species of bats in Guatemala highlights the complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. The phylogenetic relationships of the detected viruses suggest that RABV may have been introduced to Guatemala and El Salvador via eastern Mexico.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first report and isolation of RABV from bats in Guatemala, highlighting the need for novel strategies to prevent and control bat-associated zoonoses in tropical regions. The low prevalence of RABV in bats in Guatemala suggests that the virus may not be as widespread as previously thought, but the detection of RABV exposure among multiple species of bats highlights the complex dynamics of RABV perpetuation.

    **Title:** The Nuclear Lamina Regulates Heterochromatin and Gene Activation in Herpes Simplex Virus Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the nuclear lamina in regulating heterochromatin and gene activation during Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection?

    **Methods:** We examined HSV infection in wild-type (WT) and A-type lamin-deficient (Lmna−/−) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the nuclear lamina plays a crucial role in regulating heterochromatin and gene activation during HSV infection. In Lmna−/− cells, viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery, as observed in WT cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in Lmna−/− MEFs. Furthermore, lamin A/C is required for targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the nuclear lamina serves as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications. The nuclear lamina may play an additional role in providing a platform for recruitment of viral DNA as well as chromatin-modifying enzymes that keep the viral genome in an active chromatin conformation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the nuclear lamina regulates heterochromatin and gene activation during HSV infection, and that lamin A/C is required for targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters. These findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of viral infection and the regulation of chromatin structure. Further studies should determine the precise mechanism by which the nuclear lamins are exploited by HSV to keep its genome transcriptionally active during productive infection.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Diversity of Mitochondrial Translocases: Insights from Hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis

    **Research Question:** What is the structure and function of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically specialized form of mitochondria found in the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis?

    **Methods:** We isolated and characterized the TOM complex from hydrogenosomes of T. vaginalis using a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical, and electron microscopy techniques.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the highly divergent β-barrel T. vaginalis TOM (TvTom) 40-2 forms a translocation channel to conduct hydrogenosomal protein import. We identified four tail-anchored (TA) proteins associated with TvTom, including Tom36 and Tom46, which can bind hydrogenosomal preproteins and likely function as receptors. Additionally, we found a Tom22-like protein with a short cis domain and a conserved Tom22 transmembrane segment, but lacking a trans domain. Furthermore, our data indicate that TvTOM is associated with sorting and assembly machinery (Sam) 50 involved in β-barrel assembly. Electron microscopy revealed that TvTOM forms three pores and has an unconventional skull-like shape.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA), while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the diversity of mitochondrial translocases and sheds light on the evolution of protein import pathways in eukaryotes. Our results demonstrate that the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes of T. vaginalis has a unique structure and function compared to other eukaryotes, highlighting the complexity and adaptability of mitochondrial translocases in different eukaryotic lineages. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic cells and the function of mitochondria in different organisms.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Regulation of Autoimmune Diseases through Cell Type-Specific eQTL Mapping in CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells

    **Research Question:** How do genetic polymorphisms regulate the expression of genes associated with autoimmune diseases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells?

    **Methods:** We employed eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) mapping in purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to investigate the effects of genetic variants on the regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed cell type-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with several autoimmune diseases, including a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13.2 containing the rs1131017 SNP in the RPS26 gene. Notably, we identified a common missense variant in IL27, associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), which results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells only.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that eQTL mapping in purified T cells provides novel functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases. Specifically, we found that the rs181206[G] variant of the IL27 gene confers protection against T1D through the inhibited expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. Conversely, IL-27 may promote autoimmunity toward pancreatic islets via the upregulation of the STAT1 pathway.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of cell type-specific eQTL mapping in understanding the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes. The identification of a common missense variant in IL27 as a significant trans-eQTL for IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells provides new insights into the basic processes of gene expression regulation in T cells and advances our understanding of the pathways involved in disease susceptibility in the adaptive immune system. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases.

    **Title:** Understanding Socio-Cultural and Economic Barriers to Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) Screening and Treatment in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

    **Research Question:** What are the socio-cultural and economic factors that hinder the uptake of screening and treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and how can these barriers be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of HAT control?

    **Methods:** This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with current and former HAT patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the national HAT control program in the Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental provinces, two provinces lagging behind in the HAT elimination effort. Data were analyzed using the ATLAS.ti software.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that community-enforced prohibitions, such as abstaining from work, sexual intercourse, hot food, and walking in the sun for six months after HAT treatment, significantly deter people from participating in HAT screening campaigns. These prohibitions, originally intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the melarsoprol regimen, are no longer evidence-based and have become obsolete with the introduction of safer drugs. However, they remain deeply ingrained in the community, leading to sub-optimal uptake of HAT screening and treatment.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study highlight the need for a better understanding of these prohibitions, their origin, and their rationale to improve HAT control strategies in DRC. Addressing these socio-cultural and economic barriers is crucial to enhance the effectiveness of HAT control efforts.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that medical advice related to HAT management has transformed into a series of strictly enforced taboos, which are a significant determinant of sub-optimal uptake of HAT screening campaigns. Abandoning these taboos may be possible with the wider availability of safer and more effective treatment options, such as NECT. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of targeted interventions to improve community participation in HAT screening and treatment activities, ultimately contributing to the attainment of the national control program's objectives.
Title: Estimating Visceral Leishmaniasis Incidence and Mortality in Eastern Gedaref State, Sudan: A Door-to-Door Survey

    Abstract:
    Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant public health concern in Sudan, particularly in eastern Gedaref State. We conducted a door-to-door survey to estimate VL incidence and mortality rates in 45 villages of Al-Gureisha locality.

    Research Question: What is the incidence and mortality rate of visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan?

    Methods: Between May 5th and June 17th, 2011, we conducted an exhaustive door-to-door survey in 45 villages, interviewing 17,702 households with a population of 94,369 inhabitants. Verbal autopsies were conducted to investigate deaths, and individuals with fever of at least two weeks, previous VL diagnosis, or clinical suspicion of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) were referred to medical teams for case ascertainment.

    Main Findings: The crude mortality rate over the mean recall period of 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day. VL was a possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths, resulting in a VL-specific mortality rate of 0.9/1000 per year. The overall incidence of VL over the past year was 7.0/1000 persons per year, or 7.9/1000 per year when deaths possibly or probably due to VL were included. A total of 12.5% (11,943/95,609) of the population reported a past VL treatment episode.

    Implications: Our study highlights the significant health burden of VL in eastern Gedaref State. The low yield of active VL case detection in this setting with adequate access to care suggests that this approach may not be the priority intervention to enhance control in similar contexts.

    Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology of VL in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan. The high incidence and mortality rates emphasize the need for effective control measures, such as vector-control strategies, to reduce the transmission of this disease. Our findings also underscore the importance of considering the self-healing nature of PKDL in Sudan and the potential toxicity of the recommended SSG treatment.

    Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Negative Supercoiling in Bacterial Chromosomes: A Role for Gyrase and Transcription Elongation Rates

    Research Question: What is the relationship between gyrase activity, transcription elongation rates, and supercoil density in bacterial chromosomes?

    Methods: We employed a 9 kb “supercoil sensor” inserted at ten positions around the genome of Salmonella enterica to monitor both supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in wild-type (WT) and mutant strains. The sensor contains a complete Lac operon flanked by directly repeated resolvase binding sites.

    Main Findings: Our results show that RNA transcription causes negative supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess upstream supercoiling was relaxed by Topoisomerase I (Topo I), and gyrase replenished downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state. Strains with temperature-sensitive (TS) gyrase mutations exhibited significant supercoil losses varying from 30% of WT levels to a total loss of diffusible supercoil density (σD) at most chromosome locations. Supercoil losses were influenced by transcription, as addition of rifampicin (Rif) caused supercoil density to rebound throughout the chromosome. Gyrase mutants that caused dramatic supercoil losses also reduced transcription elongation rates throughout the genome.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the mean supercoil density of Salmonella DNA is determined by a mechanism that links the catalytic efficiency of gyrase to the elongation rate of transcription. The observed link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase turnover suggests that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher supercoil densities than slow-growing species.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the relationship between gyrase activity, transcription elongation rates, and supercoil density in bacterial chromosomes. The results suggest that gyrase plays a critical role in maintaining supercoil density, and that transcription elongation rates influence supercoil levels. These findings have implications for our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization and the regulation of gene expression.

    **Title:** Host Innate Response to Leishmania amazonensis Infection: Upregulation of LYST/Beige Regulates Parasitophorous Vacuole Size and Parasite Survival

    **Background:** Leishmania amazonensis, a protozoan parasite, replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) that share characteristics with late endosomes/lysosomes. However, the impact of PV size on parasite intracellular survival remains unclear.

    **Research Question:** Does the upregulation of LYST/Beige, a gene implicated in regulating lysosome size, influence PV expansion and Leishmania amazonensis replication?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of LYST/Beige in host cells infected with L. amazonensis and examined the effects of LYST/Beige mutations and overexpression on PV size and parasite growth.

    **Main Findings:** We found that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate LYST/Beige transcription, which leads to reduced PV expansion and inhibited parasite growth. Conversely, LYST/Beige mutations caused further PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication. Overexpression of LYST/Beige resulted in small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth, while treatment with vacuolin-1 reversed this phenotype, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on L. amazonensis viability within large PVs, but enhanced their growth within LYST/Beige-induced small PVs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides direct experimental evidence for the idea that increased expression of LYST/Beige restricts Leishmania growth by counteracting PV expansion. Our results suggest that targeting L. amazonensis PV expansion might lead to novel therapeutic strategies against human infections caused by this pathogen.
Title: Elucidating the Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome: A Zebrafish Model Reveals the Therapeutic Potential of Thyroid Hormone Analogues

    Abstract:
    Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, and spastic paraplegia, associated with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene. To investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AHDS, we generated an MCT8 knockout (mct8−/−) zebrafish model using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated targeted gene editing. Our results demonstrate that mct8−/− larvae exhibit neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to external light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. High-throughput behavioral assays revealed that these deficiencies are associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in live mct8−/− larvae revealed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. Notably, the administration of thyroid hormone (TH) analogues that can enter cells in the absence of MCT8 restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in mct8−/− larvae. These findings suggest a mechanism by which MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly, ultimately mediating sensory and motor control of behavioral performance. Furthermore, our results propose that the administration of TH analogues early during embryo development can specifically reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients. This study provides new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS and highlights the therapeutic potential of TH analogues in treating this disorder.

    Research Question:
    What are the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), and can thyroid hormone analogues be used to treat this disorder?

    Methods:
    We generated an MCT8 knockout (mct8−/−) zebrafish model using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated targeted gene editing. We performed high-throughput behavioral assays, time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses, and pharmacological rescue experiments to investigate the effects of MCT8 deficiency on neural circuit assembly and behavior.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that mct8−/− larvae exhibit neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to external light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. These deficiencies are associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging revealed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly, ultimately mediating sensory and motor control of behavioral performance. The administration of TH analogues that can enter cells in the absence of MCT8 restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in mct8−/− larvae, highlighting the therapeutic potential of TH analogues in treating AHDS.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS and highlights the therapeutic potential of TH analogues in treating this disorder. Our results propose that the administration of TH analogues early during embryo development can specifically reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients.

    **Title:** Formation of Stable gB-gH/gL Complexes in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Virions: Implications for Herpesvirus Entry Models

    **Background:** Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major pathogen in newborns and immunocompromised patients, utilizing distinct entry pathways involving different forms of the gH/gL glycoprotein and the viral fusion glycoprotein, gB.

    **Research Question:** Do HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early after their synthesis and in the absence of other viral proteins, and if so, what are the implications for herpesvirus entry models?

    **Methods:** We employed biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the interaction between HCMV gB and gH/gL, including co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early after their synthesis and in the absence of other viral proteins. This complex includes up to 16-50% of the total gH/gL in HCMV virus particles. Notably, gH/gL can interact with gB mutants that are unable to mediate cell-cell fusion, suggesting that gB does not require fusion competence to interact with gH/gL.

    **Implications:** Our results have major implications for herpesvirus entry models, which suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to mediate membrane fusion. Our data provide direct evidence that HCMV gB and gH/gL form stable complexes that are incorporated into virions without receptor binding or membrane fusion, supporting the proposal that gH/gL interacts with gB.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings challenge the prevailing view that gH/gL is activated by receptor binding and then binds to gB to trigger fusion. Instead, our results suggest that gB and gH/gL form a stable complex before gB is activated for fusion and entry. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of herpesvirus entry mechanisms and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent HCMV infection.

    **Title:** Gimap3 Regulates Mitochondrial DNA Segregation in Leukocytes: Implications for Human Mitochondrial Diseases

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, in regulating the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variants in leukocytes, and what are the implications for human mitochondrial diseases?

    **Methods:** We used a heteroplasmic mouse model to investigate the genetic regulation of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues. We identified Gimap3 as a critical regulator of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes and demonstrated its importance for T cell development and survival.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Gimap3 is a nuclear-encoded gene that influences mtDNA segregation in mammals. We found that Gimap3 regulates the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues and that segregation of mtDNA haplotypes in mouse hematopoietic tissues is a complex genetic trait regulated with age, independent of mtDNA copy number. We also demonstrated that altered mRNA splicing for the CAST/Ei allele changes the Gimap3 protein sequence in the soluble domain, but not the C-terminal transmembrane domain, which anchors and localizes it to the outer mitochondrial membrane.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Gimap3 is a critical gene for regulating mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues and that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and in modulating human mitochondrial diseases. The mechanisms by which Gimap3 regulates mtDNA segregation are unclear, but our results imply that a cell-specific context or pathway is required to alter mtDNA segregation.

    **Conclusions:** This study identifies Gimap3 as the first nuclear-encoded gene that influences mtDNA segregation in mammals and highlights the importance of Gimap3 in regulating mtDNA segregation in leukocytes. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and the pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which Gimap3 regulates mtDNA segregation and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target for mitochondrial diseases.
Title: Estimating the Incubation Period of Buruli Ulcer in Victoria, Australia: A Retrospective Review of 443 Cases

    Abstract:

    Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a geographically-restricted infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, with contact with endemic regions being the primary risk factor for disease acquisition. However, estimating the incubation period (IP) of BU is often hindered by the fact that most patients reside permanently in endemic areas.

    Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria, Australia between 2013 and 2016. Telephone interviews were performed to identify cases with a single visit to an endemic region or multiple visits within a one-month period. The incubation period was defined as the time between exposure to an endemic region and symptom onset.

    Main Findings: Among the 20 new cases identified in short-term visitors, the mean incubation period was 143 days (4.8 months), similar to the previous estimate of 135 days (4.5 months). We found no association between incubation period and age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure to an endemic region, or location of BU lesion.

    Implications: Our study confirms the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria to be between 4 and 5 months. This knowledge can guide clinicians and suggests that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria.

    Conclusions: Our estimate of an incubation period of 4.8 months (range 2-9 months) for Buruli ulcer confirms a previous similar estimate derived from an earlier group of patients who mostly acquired their infections in a different geographic location. This suggests that the mode of disease transmission is similar in different Victorian endemic regions. Our findings have important implications for the diagnosis and management of BU in non-residents of endemic areas, where delayed diagnosis is more common due to the prolonged incubation period.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Role of TgNCR1 in Lipid Homeostasis in Toxoplasma gondii

    **Research Question:** What is the function of the Toxoplasma gondii protein TgNCR1 in lipid homeostasis, and how does it contribute to the parasite's survival and virulence?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of TgNCR1, a protein containing the sterol-sensing domain (SSD), in Toxoplasma gondii. We generated a parasite cell line lacking TgNCR1 (ΔNCR1) and performed quantitative lipidomic analyses to examine the effects on lipid levels. We also expressed TgNCR1 in mammalian NPC1 mutant cells and assessed its ability to restore cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endo-lysosomes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that TgNCR1 is a close relative of human NPC1 and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Toxoplasma. When targeted to mammalian endo-lysosomes, TgNCR1 restores lipid trafficking from these organelles in mammalian NPC1 mutant cells. The ΔNCR1 strain exhibits normal cholesterol levels but overaccumulates several species of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. Moreover, ΔNCR1 parasites display abundant storage lipid bodies and long membranous tubules derived from their parasitophorous vacuoles.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that TgNCR1 plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma gondii, regulating the intracellular levels of several lipids. The loss of TgNCR1 function leads to the stimulation of lipid storage, membrane biosynthesis, and parasite division, resulting in faster replication in vitro and increased virulence in mice.

    **Conclusions:** Based on these observations, we ascribe a role for TgNCR1 in lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma gondii. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid regulation in this intracellular parasite and highlight the potential of TgNCR1 as a target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against Toxoplasmosis.

    **Title:** Loss of SMOC1 Function Causes Ophthalmo-Acromelic Syndrome: Insights from Human Genetics and Mouse Modeling

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic basis of Ophthalmo-Acromelic Syndrome (OAS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by eye malformations and post-axial oligosyndactyly?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of homozygosity mapping, targeted mutation analysis, and mouse modeling to identify the genetic cause of OAS. We analyzed eight unrelated families with OAS and identified homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene on chromosome 14q24.2. We also generated a targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mouse mutation of Smoc1, which resulted in a convincing phenocopy of the human disease.

    **Main Findings:** We identified four nonsense, two frameshift, and two missense mutations in SMOC1 in eight unrelated families with OAS. The missense mutations were located in the second Thyroglobulin Type-1 (Tg1) domain of the protein. We also generated a targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mouse mutation of Smoc1, which resulted in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly, eye malformations, and cleft palate in homozygous mutant animals. The mouse phenotype showed significant overlap with the human disease.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that loss of SMOC1 function is the major cause of OAS. SMOC-1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic, and functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mice.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides strong evidence for the genetic basis of OAS and highlights the conserved non-redundant function of SMOC-1 during ocular and limb development. The mouse model generated in this study provides a valuable tool for understanding the pathogenesis of OAS and may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for this devastating disorder.
Title: Identification of TRIM22 as a Key Mediator of Type 1 Interferon-Induced Restriction of HIV Replication

    Abstract:

    Background: Type 1 interferons (IFNs) have been shown to restrict HIV replication in human cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this antiviral activity remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of the tripartite motif protein TRIM22 in the restriction of HIV replication by Type 1 interferons?

    Methods: We employed transcriptional profiling to identify cellular genes induced by IFN treatment and identified TRIM22 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes. We then used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete TRIM22 in human cells and assessed the effects on HIV replication. We also performed mutational analyses of TRIM22 to determine the functional domains required for its antiviral activity.

    Main Findings: Our results show that TRIM22 is a key mediator of IFN-induced restriction of HIV replication. TRIM22 over-expression inhibited HIV replication, and knockdown of TRIM22 in the context of an IFN response abrogated the late block to HIV replication. We also found that TRIM22 specifically targets the HIV Gag protein, disrupting its proper trafficking and preventing the release of virus-like particles. Mutational analyses revealed that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain are essential for TRIM22's antiviral activity.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of Type 1 interferons and identify TRIM22 as a key effector molecule in the restriction of HIV replication. These results have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HIV infection.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that TRIM22 plays a critical role in the restriction of HIV replication by Type 1 interferons. The identification of TRIM22 as a key mediator of this antiviral activity highlights its potential as a target for the development of novel antiretroviral therapies. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying TRIM22's antiviral activity and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

    **Title:** Parasitic Wasps Contribute to Mutualism Stability in Fig-Pollinator Symbiosis

    **Research Question:** What mechanisms prevent pollinating wasps from exploiting all available ovules in monoecious Ficus species, contributing to the stability of the fig-pollinator mutualism?

    **Methods:** We investigated the oviposition behavior of pollinating wasps (Agaonidae) in Ficus rubiginosa and found that offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. We measured the gradient of parasitism risk across the syconium and found that it decreases towards the center, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability contributes to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, reducing their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that parasitic wasps play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the fig-pollinator mutualism. By selecting inner ovules for oviposition, pollinating wasps gain a fitness benefit due to reduced vulnerability to parasitism. This finding highlights the importance of considering the interactions between pollinators and parasitic wasps in understanding the dynamics of mutualisms.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying mutualism stability in monoecious Ficus species. The provision of ovules with high variance in profitability to foundresses demonstrates that the fig tree, the larger partner in the symbiosis, controls the resources available to the smaller, more mobile partner, the pollinating wasp. Our results suggest that the fig-pollinator mutualism is more complex than previously thought, with multiple factors contributing to its stability, including the presence of parasitic wasps. This study has important implications for our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of mutualisms in general.

    Title: Dissecting the Genetic and Environmental Components of Plant Height in Setaria: A Recombinant Inbred Line Population Study

    Research Question: How do genetic and environmental factors, including water availability and planting density, influence plant height in an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population?

    Methods: Six controlled growth trials were conducted in both field and controlled environments to assess the effects of water availability and planting density on plant height in a Setaria RIL population. Non-destructive measurements of plant height were taken throughout the plant life cycle.

    Main Findings: Our results show that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high density planting, and is influenced by growth environment (field vs. growth chamber). The genetic architecture of plant height is heritable and polygenic, with major genetic loci functioning independently of growth environment. The identity and contribution of loci influencing height change dynamically throughout development, and the reduction of growth observed in water-limited environments is a consequence of delayed progression through the genetic program establishing plant height in Setaria.

    Implications: Our study supports a model where plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The results suggest that alleles inherited from the weedy S. viridis parent act to increase plant height early, while a larger number of small effect alleles inherited from the domesticated S. italica parent collectively act to increase plant height later in development.

    Conclusions: By combining field and controlled environmental analysis with quantitative genetics, we have dissected the genetic and environmental components of plant height in Setaria. Our findings provide insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that influence plant growth and development. The chronological genetic model of plant height may explain differences in plant height observed when parental lines are grown in controlled environments versus field settings. The identification of 37 QTL associated with plant height throughout development highlights the complexity of this trait and underscores the importance of considering temporal and environmental factors in understanding plant growth and development.

    **Title:** Confirmation of Ilheus Virus (ILHV) Circulation in the Brazilian Pantanal through Mosquito Isolation and Molecular Detection

    **Research Question:** Does Ilheus virus (ILHV) circulate in the Brazilian Pantanal, and if so, which mosquito species are involved in its transmission?

    **Methods:** We collected 3,234 adult mosquitoes of 16 species from the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal between 2009 and 2010. Mosquito pool homogenates were assayed for infectious virus on C6/36 and Vero cell monolayers and tested for flaviviral RNA by group-specific real-time RT-PCR.

    **Main Findings:** One pool containing 50 non-engorged female Aedes scapularis mosquitoes tested positive for ILHV by culture and for ILHV RNA by real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full-length genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the only full genome sequence available for ILHV.

    **Implications:** The present data confirm the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal, a region known for its diverse wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods, which favor the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses. The isolation of ILHV in mosquitoes while attempting to blood feed on a human warrants further investigation of this virus by the Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local physicians.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence of ILHV activity in the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal, through the isolation of ILHV from a pool of Ae. scapularis, a mosquito species that has transmitted ILHV efficiently in laboratory vector competence studies. The anthropophilic behavior, relatively high prevalence, and susceptibility to infection of Ae. scapularis implicate this species as a potential vector of ILHV in the region. The confirmation of ILHV circulation in the Brazilian Pantanal highlights the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of arbovirus activity in this region to prevent and control the spread of zoonotic diseases.

    **Title:** Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Moxidectin in a Porcine Scabies Model: A Promising Alternative to Ivermectin

    **Research Question:** Can a single oral dose of moxidectin (MOX) be more effective than two consecutive doses of ivermectin (IVM) in treating scabies in a porcine model?

    **Methods:** Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MOX (0.3 mg/kg once), IVM (0.2 mg/kg twice), or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by assessing mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies reductions. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were also determined.

    **Main Findings:** At day 14 post-treatment, all four MOX-treated pigs were mite-free, whereas only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free. MOX efficacy was 100% and remained unchanged until study-end (D47), compared to 62% (range 26-100%) for IVM, with one IVM-treated pig remaining infected until D47. Clinical scabies lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies had completely disappeared in all MOX-treated but only 75% of IVM-treated pigs. MOX persisted ~9 times longer than IVM in plasma and skin, thereby covering the mite’s entire life cycle and enabling long-lasting efficacy.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that oral single-dose MOX is more effective than two consecutive IVM doses in treating scabies in a porcine model. Given the growing public health burden of scabies and the emergence of drug resistance in mites, MOX may be a promising alternative therapeutic option.

    **Conclusions:** This preclinical study demonstrates the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of MOX in a porcine scabies model, supporting its potential as a therapeutic approach for scabies. Further studies should investigate the efficacy and dose selection of MOX in humans, including a pivotal Phase II trial for MOX for scabies elimination.
Title: Elucidating the Minimal Peptidoglycan Synthesis Machinery of Staphylococcus aureus: Implications for Antibiotic Resistance and Pathogenicity

    Abstract:
    The peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machine is a complex molecular assembly responsible for the synthesis of the main component of the bacterial cell wall. In Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen notorious for its antibiotic resistance and virulence, the PG synthesis machine is composed of nine proteins. To identify the essential components of this machine, we deleted seven of the nine genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes from the S. aureus genome, resulting in a strain capable of PG biosynthesis catalyzed solely by two penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. Our results demonstrate that S. aureus can grow and divide with only two active PG synthesizing enzymes, indicating that most of these enzymes are redundant in vitro. However, in clinically relevant environments, bacteria with a minimal PG synthesis machinery became highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics, host lytic enzymes, and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model. These findings highlight the importance of a complex molecular machine in environments other than in vitro growth, where the expendable PG synthesis enzymes play a crucial role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus. Our study identifies the minimal PG synthesis machinery of S. aureus, which constitutes the most relevant targets for the development of antibiotics capable of inhibiting the final stages of PG synthesis.

    Methods:
    We constructed a S. aureus strain encoding the minimal number of PG synthesis enzymes required for survival by deleting seven of the nine known genes encoding proteins with PG synthesis activity. We used profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) to scan the S. aureus genome and identify close and distantly related homologues of transpeptidase and transglycosylase enzymes.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that S. aureus cells are capable of PG synthesis catalyzed solely by the transpeptidase PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. Interactions between PBPs of Gram-positive organisms have been suggested, but our study provides the first biochemical confirmation of these interactions.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for the development of antibiotics capable of inhibiting the final stages of PG synthesis. The identification of the minimal PG synthesis machinery of S. aureus highlights the importance of a complex molecular machine in environments other than in vitro growth, where the expendable PG synthesis enzymes play a crucial role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study has identified the minimal machinery required for PG synthesis in S. aureus, demonstrating the plasticity of this process. Our results provide new insights into the biology of S. aureus and highlight the importance of a complex molecular machine in environments other than in vitro growth, where the expendable PG synthesis enzymes play a crucial role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus.

    Title: Elucidating Iron Acquisition Pathways in Burkholderia pseudomallei: A Novel Ferritin-Iron Acquisition Pathway Contributes to Virulence

    Background: Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium that can infect humans, causing melioidosis, a disease with high mortality rates despite proper diagnosis and treatment. The bacterium's ability to infect, invade, and survive within hosts is not well understood, and little is known about the role of critical nutrients such as iron in its pathogenesis.

    Research Question: What are the iron acquisition pathways employed by Burkholderia pseudomallei, and how do they contribute to its virulence?

    Methods: We generated isogenic mutants of B. pseudomallei strain 1710b with deletions in the major siderophore malleobactin (mba) and pyochelin (pch) gene clusters, as well as the hemin uptake loci hmu and hem. We assessed the residual siderophore activity, iron utilization, and virulence of these mutants in a murine melioidosis model.

    Main Findings: Our results show that B. pseudomallei employs a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth. The mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. We also found that lactoferrin utilization was dependent on malleobactin, but not pyochelin synthesis and/or uptake.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that B. pseudomallei's ability to adapt to adverse conditions within the host may have endowed it to acquire iron in the absence of malleobactin, potentially through upregulation of other siderophores or iron-acquisition mechanisms. The discovery of a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway highlights the complexity of B. pseudomallei's iron acquisition strategies and underscores the need for further investigation into its pathogenesis.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the iron acquisition pathways of B. pseudomallei and highlights the importance of ferritin-iron acquisition in its virulence. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against melioidosis, a disease with high mortality rates in tropical and subtropical regions.

    **Title:** COMMGEN: A Novel Tool for Consensus Metabolic Model Generation and Resolution of Inconsistencies in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models

    **Background:** Genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs) are essential for understanding cellular function and predicting metabolic behavior. However, their usability is often hindered by inconsistencies between concurrent models, particularly for eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

    **Research Question:** Can a novel tool, COMMGEN, automatically identify and resolve inconsistencies between concurrent GSMs, leading to more accurate and comprehensive representations of metabolism?

    **Methods:** We developed COMMGEN, a tool for COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration, which reconciles two or more distinct GSMs of the same organism beyond a common namespace. COMMGEN automatically identifies similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of the metabolic networks based on an extensive classification of problems that typically arise during GSM integration and novel algorithms to resolve these problem classes.

    **Main Findings:** Our tests of COMMGEN for four organisms showed that automatically generated consensus models were predictive and substantially increased coherence of knowledge representation. Notably, automatically generated consensus models almost always had higher predictive power than manually curated GSMs and were comparable to manually constructed consensus models.

    **Implications:** COMMGEN fills the gap between full automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus metabolic model generation. By reconciling inconsistencies between concurrent models, COMMGEN increases coherence with the actual biological system while maintaining predictive power. This balance is crucial for the usability and reliability of GSMs to elucidate cell function interactions.

    **Conclusions:** COMMGEN is a valuable tool for the scientific community, particularly for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale. Our results demonstrate the potential of COMMGEN to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of metabolic models, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of cellular function and its applications in biotechnology and medicine.
Title: Cartilage Proteoglycans Regulate Chondrocyte Maturation and Perichondral Bone Development in Zebrafish

    Abstract:
    Chondrocytes embedded in a proteoglycan (PG)-rich matrix undergo a developmental transition, termed maturation, to induce bone formation in the overlying perichondrium. We investigated the role of PGs in regulating interactions between chondrocytes and perichondrium in zebrafish mutants. Using a mutagenesis screen, we isolated mutants with decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichondral bone formation. Positional cloning identified lesions in two genes, fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 (xylt1), which encode PG synthesis enzymes. Mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs and initiated perichondral bone formation earlier than their wild-type siblings. Primary chondrocyte defects might induce the bone phenotype secondarily, as mutant chondrocytes precociously initiated maturation, showing increased and early expression of markers such as runx2b, collagen type 10a1, and ihh co-orthologs. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix organization and early cellular features of chondrocyte hypertrophy in mutants. Our data argue that defective cartilage PG synthesis alters expression of transcription factors that determine the rates of chondrocyte maturation, thus changing the timing of perichondral bone formation.

    Research Question:
    Do cartilage proteoglycans regulate interactions between chondrocytes and perichondrium in zebrafish mutants?

    Methods:
    We used a mutagenesis screen to isolate zebrafish mutants with decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichondral bone formation. Positional cloning identified lesions in two genes, fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 (xylt1), which encode PG synthesis enzymes. We performed biochemical and histochemical analyses to verify matrix defects and ultrastructural analyses to examine cellular features of chondrocyte maturation.

    Main Findings:
    Mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs and initiated perichondral bone formation earlier than their wild-type siblings. Primary chondrocyte defects might induce the bone phenotype secondarily, as mutant chondrocytes precociously initiated maturation, showing increased and early expression of markers such as runx2b, collagen type 10a1, and ihh co-orthologs. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix organization and early cellular features of chondrocyte hypertrophy in mutants.

    Implications:
    Our data argue that defective cartilage PG synthesis alters expression of transcription factors that determine the rates of chondrocyte maturation, thus changing the timing of perichondral bone formation.

    Conclusions:
    Cartilage proteoglycans play a critical role in regulating interactions between chondrocytes and perichondrium in zebrafish mutants. Mutations in fam20b and xylt1 genes, which encode PG synthesis enzymes, lead to defective cartilage matrix production and precocious chondrocyte maturation, resulting in early perichondral bone formation. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal development and highlight the importance of cartilage PGs in regulating chondrocyte maturation and perichondral bone development.

    **Title:** Topoisomerase II is essential for resolving heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females

    **Research Question:** How do heterochromatic homologs separate during meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females, and what role does Topoisomerase II play in this process?

    **Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Topoisomerase II (Top2) in Drosophila melanogaster females during the later stages of meiosis. We analyzed the effects of Top2 RNAi on the separation of heterochromatic regions and the behavior of achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes during prometaphase I and metaphase I.

    **Main Findings:** Knockdown of Top2 resulted in specific defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions, leading to the formation of long, abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips of the projections. Both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes displayed defects in biorientation, and the obligately achiasmate 4th chromosomes failed to move towards the spindle poles during prometaphase I. Despite the presence of bipolar spindles, embryos from Top2 RNAi-expressing females frequently failed to initiate mitotic divisions.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that Topoisomerase II is essential for resolving heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females. The failure to resolve these entanglements leads to defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions and the biorientation of achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes. This, in turn, results in the failure of oocytes to exit meiosis I and initiate mitotic divisions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that Topoisomerase II plays a critical role in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females. The data support the idea that Top2 is involved in releasing the bonds that hold heterochromatic regions together during prophase, allowing for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis I. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosome segregation and the role of Topoisomerase II in this process.
Title: Evaluation of Deltamethrin-Impregnated Collars as a Public Health Measure to Control Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) in a Highly Endemic Area of Brazil

    Abstract:

    Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic disease of significant public health importance, with limitations in current control measures compromising efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mass use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in dogs as a public health measure to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in a highly endemic area of Brazil.

    Methods: An interventional study was conducted in two endemic areas in the district of Monte Gordo, Bahia-Brazil: an intervention area where VL seronegative dogs were collared, and a control area where only conventional CVL control measures were applied. Dogs were reevaluated every 7-8 months for almost two years, with seropositive dogs removed and seronegative dogs included and collared. Local zoonosis control authorities were notified of seropositive dogs, which were subsequently marked for euthanasia as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

    Main Findings: At the first serological survey, seroprevalence was similar in both areas. However, significant reductions in seroprevalence were observed in both areas at the second evaluation, with the intervention area reducing to 6.0% during the final evaluation, compared to an increase of 11.0% in the control area. The estimated relative risk (RR = 0.55) indicated protection against CVL in the intervention area.

    Implications: Although CVL incidence did not differ significantly between the areas, an increased tendency was observed in the control area, which could be due to low seroconversion rates or high loss to follow-up. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a community-wide public health control measure was inconclusive, but this measure likely provides protection over time.

    Conclusions: The use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a public health measure to control CVL in a highly endemic area of Brazil represents an operational challenge for local zoonosis control authorities, indicating the need for adjustments, including improved collar design. This study contributes to the understanding of the effectiveness of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in controlling CVL and highlights the importance of continued research in this area.

    **Title:** Transcriptional Traffic Jams on the X Chromosome: A Novel Explanation for Biased Gene Content and Expression

    **Research Question:** What is the role of haploid expression of the X chromosome in shaping the gene content and expression of X-linked genes?

    **Methods:** We analyzed gene expression data from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project to investigate the maximal expression levels of human X-linked genes compared to autosomal genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is significantly lower than that of autosomal genes, with an average of three times lower maximal expression on the X chromosome than on autosomes. We also found that autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Furthermore, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal genes compared to the human/Chimpanzee common ancestor, especially for highly expressed genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the haploid expression of the X chromosome imposes a limit on the maximal expression level of X-linked genes, leading to biased gene content and expression profiles. This "weak X" model provides a simple yet robust explanation for many peculiar features of X chromosome biology, including the lower breadth of expression for genes on the X and the rarity of highly expressed tissue-specific genes on the X.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the haploid expression of the X chromosome is a key factor in shaping the gene content and expression of X-linked genes. The "weak X" model offers a novel perspective on the evolution of gene content on the X chromosome, highlighting the importance of transcriptional traffic jams in limiting the maximal expression of X-linked genes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of X chromosome biology and the evolution of gene expression in mammals.

    **Title:** Investigating the Prevalence and Population Structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pygmies from Cameroon

    **Research Question:** What is the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pygmies from Cameroon, and how does it compare to their agriculturalist neighbors?

    **Methods:** Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka Pygmies and 101 non-Baka individuals from neighboring agriculturalist populations in Cameroon through esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The biopsies were cultured for Helicobacter pylori, and multilocus haplotypes were generated for each isolate by DNA sequencing.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to expectations, Baka Pygmies showed a significantly lower Helicobacter pylori infection rate (20.8%) compared to non-Baka individuals (80.2%). Most Helicobacter pylori isolates in the Baka sample were assigned to the hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1 populations. An age-structured transmission model suggested that the low Helicobacter pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies is achievable within a few hundred years, indicating that demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy may lead to the eradication of Helicobacter pylori from individual human populations.

    **Implications:** The findings suggest that Baka Pygmies were either Helicobacter pylori-free or lost their ancient lineages during past demographic fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference revealed that Baka Pygmies almost certainly acquired their extant Helicobacter pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pygmies from Cameroon. The low Helicobacter pylori infection rate among Baka Pygmies, compared to their agriculturalist neighbors, highlights the importance of demographic factors in shaping the transmission dynamics of this pathogen. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolutionary history of Helicobacter pylori and its relationship with human populations.

    Title: Structural and Functional Analysis of Dengue Virus NS5 Subcellular Localization Reveals Evolutionarily Conserved Motifs

    Background: Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a highly conserved protein among flaviviruses, responsible for capping, methylation, and replication of the viral RNA genome. However, DENV2 NS5 exhibits an unusual characteristic of localizing to the nucleus during infection, despite replication occurring in the cytoplasm.

    Research Question: What are the structural and functional determinants of NS5 subcellular localization in DENV1 and DENV2?

    Methods: We employed a combination of functional and structural analyses, including gene swapping, mutational analysis, and x-ray crystallography, to investigate the subcellular localization of NS5 in DENV1 and DENV2.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the C-terminal 18 residues (Cter18) of NS5 are sufficient to direct the protein to the cytoplasm or nucleus, depending on the serotype. We identified a low micromolar binding affinity between NS5 Cter18 and the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha (Impα), which allowed us to purify and visualize their molecular complex at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis revealed residues important for NS5 subcellular localization, including Pro-884, which allows proper presentation for binding Impα, and R888, which forms a hydrogen bond with Y838 conserved in all flaviviruses.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the Cter18 of NS5 is an evolutionarily conserved motif that may be involved in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of its role in subcellular localization. The P884T mutation in DENV2 NS5 results in mislocalization to the cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness, while the R888A mutation leads to a completely non-viable virus, and the R888K mutation results in a severely attenuated phenotype.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the structural and functional determinants of NS5 subcellular localization in DENV1 and DENV2, and highlights the importance of the Cter18 motif in flavivirus replication and pathogenesis. These findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of DENV infection and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    **Title:** Development and Field-Testing of an Integrated Threshold Mapping Methodology for Neglected Tropical Diseases

    **Research Question:** Can an integrated mapping protocol be developed and field-tested to determine whether thresholds for public health interventions have been reached for lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in endemic countries?

    **Methods:** We developed and field-tested the Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) Methodology, a novel integrated mapping protocol for LF, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and STH. The protocol relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators in disease-specific age groups and is designed to be resource-efficient. We tested the protocol in one district each in Mali and Senegal, comparing it to current WHO mapping methodologies for each disease.

    **Main Findings:** The ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM protocol was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-saving compared to the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies.

    **Implications:** The ITM methodology has the potential to facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries by providing a logistically practical, cost-efficient, and flexible approach to determining whether thresholds for public health interventions have been reached.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the ITM methodology as an operational tool for Ministries of Health in NTD-endemic countries to determine if the threshold needed to launch disease-specific public health interventions has been reached. The ITM protocol can provide district-level data in a timely manner, addressing the need for integrated mapping approaches in NTD-endemic countries.

    **Title:** Histone Modifications Regulate Cdc14 Release from Nucleolar Chromatin during Mitotic Exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** How do histone modifications influence the release of the conserved phosphatase Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin during mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of histone modifications in the release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin during mitotic exit. We analyzed the genetic interactions between histone ubiquitination, histone methylation, and the mitotic exit network (MEN) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal a novel requirement for the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase in the cell cycle-dependent release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by the activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (meH3K4 and meH3K79). Notably, this process is not dependent on the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Sir2, which associates with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin as part of the RENT complex. We also observed defects in Cdc14 release in cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation (meH3K36) and in cells lacking an HDAC recruited by this modification.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of histone modifications in regulating the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components. The non-redundant role of these modifications in this context contrasts with the notion of a highly combinatorial code by which histone marks act to control biological processes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for a role for the conserved ubiquitin ligase Bre1 and monoubiquitination of histone H2B in the early phase of mitotic exit. These findings suggest that histone modifications play a critical role in regulating the release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin during mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The conservation of these histone modifications from yeast to mammals suggests that their role in controlling localization of Cdc14 may also be conserved.

    **Title:** GeneProgram: A Novel Computational Framework for Identifying Expression Programs in Human Gene Expression Compendia

    **Research Question:** How can we develop a computational framework to identify expression programs, sets of co-expressed genes orchestrating normal or pathological processes, from large compendia of human gene expression data?

    **Methods:** We developed GeneProgram, an unsupervised computational framework based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, to address the challenges of cellular inhomogeneity, genetic and environmental variation, uncertainty in the numbers of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. GeneProgram simultaneously organizes tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior, producing maps of expression programs sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings.

    **Main Findings:** Using synthetic and real gene expression data, we demonstrated that GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. We applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, a substantial number of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors in genome-wide experiments. Notably, GeneProgram discovered expression programs that implicate surprising signaling pathways or receptor types in the response to infection, including Wnt signaling and neurotransmitter receptors.

    **Implications:** The discovered map of expression programs involved in the response to infection will be useful for guiding future biological experiments. Genes from programs with low generality scores might serve as new drug targets that exhibit minimal “cross-talk,” and genes from high generality programs may maintain common physiological responses that go awry in disease states. Our method is multipurpose and can be applied readily to novel compendia of biological data.

    **Conclusions:** GeneProgram is a novel computational framework that addresses the challenges of analyzing large compendia of human gene expression data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GeneProgram in identifying expression programs and characterizing their functional breadth. We believe that the maps of expression programs discovered by GeneProgram will be particularly useful for guiding future biological experiments and identifying new therapeutic targets.

    Title: Epigenetic Remodeling of the IFNG Locus Drives Adaptive Features in Human NK Cells Expanded in Response to Cytomegalovirus Infection

    Research Question: What molecular mechanisms underlie the adaptive properties of NK cells expanded in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection?

    Methods: We investigated the epigenetic regulation of the IFNG locus in NK cells expanded in human CMV (HCMV) seropositive individuals. We analyzed the epigenetic remodeling of the conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1) region of the IFNG locus in NKG2Chi NK cells and cytokine-primed NK cells.

    Main Findings: We found that only NKG2Chi NK cells expanded in HCMV+ individuals underwent epigenetic remodeling of the CNS1 region, similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells. The accessibility of the CNS1 region was required to enhance IFN-γ transcriptional activity in response to NKG2C and 2B4 engagement, leading to consistent IFN-γ production in NKG2Chi NK cells.

    Implications: Our data identify epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus as a selective hallmark and crucial mechanism driving strong and stable IFN-γ expression in HCMV-specific NK cell expansions. This finding provides a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that epigenetic remodeling of the CNS1 region in the IFNG locus is a hallmark of NKG2Chi NK cells expanded in HCMV+ individuals and cytokine-primed NK cells. This epigenetic regulation enhances IFN-γ transcriptional activity in response to activating receptors, leading to consistent IFN-γ production. Our findings suggest that common epigenomic features may be functional hallmarks of memory-like NK cells and memory T cells. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which adaptive features of NKG2Chi expansions depend on low-level viral reactivation events occurring in healthy HCMV+ individuals.

    **Title:** Temporal Regulation of Bacterial Effectors by Metaeffectors: A Novel Mechanism of Coevolution between Eukaryotic Cells and Bacterial Pathogens

    **Research Question:** How do bacterial pathogens regulate the function of effector proteins within eukaryotic host cells during infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of the Legionella pneumophila effector protein LubX, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in regulating the activity of the bacterial effector protein SidH within host cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that LubX targets SidH for degradation by hijacking the host proteasome system, leading to the shutdown of SidH activity at later stages of infection. This temporal regulation of SidH by LubX represents a novel mechanism of coevolution between eukaryotic cells and L. pneumophila. We propose the designation "metaeffector" for this class of bacterial effectors that regulate the function of another effector within the host cell.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between bacterial pathogens and eukaryotic host cells. The identification of LubX as a metaeffector highlights the sophisticated level of coevolution between these two organisms, where bacterial effectors have evolved to regulate the activity of other effectors within the host cell. This raises the possibility that other bacterial effectors may also function as metaeffectors, regulating the expression of effector functions spatiotemporally.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first evidence of a metaeffector, a designation for an effector protein that regulates the function of another effector within the host cell. The discovery of LubX as a metaeffector sheds light on the complex mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis and highlights the importance of temporal regulation of effector proteins during infection. Future studies will reveal the prevalence of metaeffectors among bacterial pathogens and their role in manipulating the host ubiquitin system.

    **Title:** Investigating the Diversification of HIV-1 env Coding Sequences in Newly Infected Individuals

    **Research Question:** What is the pattern of viral diversification in newly infected individuals and how does it relate to host environment and immune responses?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 2,207 env coding sequences from 81 very early B subtype HIV-1 infections, which were previously shown to have resulted from transmission or expansion of single viruses (n = 78) or two closely related viruses (n = 3). We integrated information across multiple acutely infected hosts to infer the direction of substitutions and distinguish between insertion and deletion events.

    **Main Findings:** Our results provide evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identify a subset of codon sites that diversified more rapidly than expected under a model of neutral evolution. Of 24 such rapidly diversifying sites, 14 were embedded in CTL epitopes that were verified experimentally or predicted based on the individual's HLA, or in a nucleotide context indicative of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions. In several cases, a rapidly evolving site was embedded both in an APOBEC motif and in a CTL epitope, suggesting that APOBEC may facilitate early immune escape.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during the establishment of new infections. We also provide evidence that the length variation seen in hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a consequence of selection and not of mutational hotspots.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a detailed view of the process of diversification of HIV-1 following transmission, underscoring the importance of CTL escape and hypermutation in early infection. Our results suggest that APOBEC may play a role in facilitating early immune escape, and that the length variation in hypervariable loop regions is driven by selection rather than mutational hotspots. These findings have important implications for our understanding of HIV-1 evolution and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of Epigenetic Silencing in Budding Yeast: A Minimal Model Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the essential epigenetic marks required for the bistability of epigenetic states in budding yeast, and how do multiple marks contribute to the robustness of epigenetic silencing?

    **Methods:** We developed a minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast, incorporating two key chromatin marks: H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation. Our model explores the effects of multiple marks on the system's behavior, including the emergence of a novel bivalent state characterized by both active and silencing marks.

    **Main Findings:** Our model reveals that the presence of both H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation is crucial for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the titration effect, resulting from a limited supply of silencing proteins, can lead to counter-intuitive responses. Notably, our model predicts the emergence of a bivalent state under various perturbations, including knock-out mutations, inhibition, or enhancement of enzymatic activity. This bivalent state is associated with patchy silencing.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the design principles of the silencing system, shedding light on the controversial role of Dot1 in yeast silencing. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, enabling the identification of essential marks that resolve epigenetic fate and those that reinforce one fate over another.

    **Conclusions:** Our minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast captures the distinct mechanisms of cooperativity at the molecular level, including cooperativity in histone modification states and cooperative interactions of Sir proteins in a chromatin-bound complex. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple marks and their interactions in understanding the complex behavior of epigenetic silencing systems. The model provides a framework for systematically investigating the behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading, and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the systems biology of yeast silencing.

    **Title:** Gut Microbiota Composition in Ugandan Children with Severe Acute Malnutrition: A Comparative Study of Oedematous and Non-Oedematous Forms

    **Background:** Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a significant public health concern in developing countries, manifesting in both oedematous and non-oedematous forms. The pathogenesis of SAM is poorly understood, but gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis has been linked to oedematous malnutrition. This study aimed to investigate whether GM composition differs between Ugandan children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM.

    **Methods:** Fecal samples were collected from 87 children hospitalized with SAM aged 6-24 months in Uganda. Total genomic DNA was extracted, and PCR amplification was performed followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and tag-encoded 16S rRNA gene-targeted high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity measures were determined, and ANOVA mean relative abundance and G-test of independence were used to compare GM composition between groups.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that GM composition differed between oedematous and non-oedematous SAM children, with non-oedematous children having lower GM alpha diversity (p = 0.036). However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal significant differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children. The lack of clear compositional differences between the two groups may indicate that other factors, such as environmental or host-related factors, contribute to the development of oedematous and non-oedematous SAM.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the relationship between GM composition and SAM in Ugandan children. Our results support the notion that GM dysbiosis is associated with malnutrition, but further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. These findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies, including the use of pre- and probiotics, to prevent and treat SAM in developing countries.

    **Title:** Extensive Telomere Length Variation in Saccharomyces paradoxus: A Complex Trait Controlled by Multiple Loci

    **Research Question:** What is the extent of variation in telomere length among Saccharomyces paradoxus isolates, and what are the genetic mechanisms underlying this variation?

    **Methods:** We screened 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates, including 112 Saccharomyces paradoxus strains, for telomere length variation. We used a URA3 gene insertion near telomeres to accurately analyze individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). We crossed American and European strains to generate F1 spores and genotyped them to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with telomere length and silencing variation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show extensive telomere length variation among S. paradoxus isolates, with European strains having extremely short telomeres (<150 bp) and American isolates having telomeres approximately three times as long (>400 bp). We identified several QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including likely candidate genes and regions with no known genes involved in telomeric properties. We also detected transgressive segregation for both phenotypes and validated YKU80 and TLC1 as telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Furthermore, we propose that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis in one of the allelic combinations (American-YKU70 and European-YKU80), resulting in very short telomeres.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that telomere length is a complex trait controlled by multiple loci in Saccharomyces paradoxus, similar to humans. The identification of QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying this variation. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of telomere length in yeast and potentially other organisms.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive analysis of telomere length variation in Saccharomyces paradoxus and sheds light on the genetic mechanisms controlling this complex trait. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple loci and epistatic interactions in understanding the regulation of telomere length.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Hidden Dynamics of Human Decision Making: A Computational Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** Can sequential sampling models (SSMs) accurately predict response times (RTs) in decision-making tasks when individuals are allowed to sample information sequentially, or do they fail to account for the complexity of human decision-making processes?

    **Methods:** We conducted two independent studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate decision-making in a sequential choice paradigm. Participants were presented with fictitious stocks and were free to respond at any time. We developed several SSMs to predict RTs and compared their performance to the data.

    **Main Findings:** Standard SSM implementations failed to adequately describe RT distributions. However, by incorporating a mechanism for postponing decisions, we obtained an accurate fit to the data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies (14-30 Hz), indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited, supporting the existence of a decision not to decide.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that SSMs need to be extended to account for the possibility of temporarily terminating the decision process to wait for more information. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of human decision-making and the development of more accurate computational models.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for the existence of a decision not to decide, which is not accounted for by standard SSMs. We propose that factors such as the number of cues and their presentation time influence how long people postpone their decision process. Our results support a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition and highlight the importance of considering the complexity of human decision-making processes in computational modeling. By incorporating a mechanism for postponing decisions, our extended model provides a more accurate description of RTs and sheds light on the neural processes underlying human decision-making.
Title: Identification of a Missense Variant in SUV39H2 as the Causative Genetic Defect for Hereditary Nasal Parakeratosis in Labrador Retrievers

Abstract:
Hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK) is a monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder in Labrador Retrievers characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. To elucidate the genetic basis of HNPK, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 13 HNPK cases and 23 controls. Our analysis revealed a single strong association signal on chromosome 2, which defined a critical interval of 1.6 Mb containing 25 predicted genes. We re-sequenced the genome of one case at 38× coverage and identified three non-synonymous variants within the critical interval. Genotyping these variants in a larger cohort of dogs revealed that a missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, encoding a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, was perfectly associated with the HNPK phenotype. This variant, c.972T>G, is predicted to change an evolutionarily conserved asparagine to a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme (p.N324K). Histopathological analysis of the epidermis in vivo revealed that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Our findings provide evidence that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis.

Methods:
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 13 HNPK cases and 23 controls. We re-sequenced the genome of one case at 38× coverage and identified three non-synonymous variants within the critical interval. We genotyped these variants in a larger cohort of dogs and performed histopathological analysis of the epidermis in vivo.

Main Findings:
Our GWAS analysis revealed a single strong association signal on chromosome 2, which defined a critical interval of 1.6 Mb containing 25 predicted genes. We identified a missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, encoding a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, that was perfectly associated with the HNPK phenotype. Histopathological analysis of the epidermis in vivo revealed that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.

Implications:
Our findings provide evidence that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis. The identification of a missense variant in SUV39H2 as the causative genetic defect for HNPK in Labrador Retrievers highlights the importance of histone modifying enzymes in the regulation of epidermal differentiation.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, our study identifies a missense variant in SUV39H2 as the causative genetic defect for HNPK in Labrador Retrievers. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HNPK and highlight the importance of histone modifying enzymes in the regulation of epidermal differentiation.

    **Title:** Genetic Reassortment between Avian and Swine Influenza A Viruses in Pigs: A Study on the Emergence of Transmissible Reassortants

    **Research Question:** How do genetic reassortments between avian and swine influenza A viruses (IAVs) occur in pigs, and what factors contribute to the emergence of transmissible reassortants?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genomic analysis of 571 isolates recovered from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of co-housed pigs infected with avian H1N1 IAV and swine H3N2 IAV. The pigs were divided into three groups: influenza-seronegative, avian H1N1 IAV-infected, and swine H3N2 IAV-infected.

    **Main Findings:** Our study identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants, with the largest genomic diversity observed in viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues. Reassortants from lower respiratory tracts exhibited the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells, and the cold temperature in swine nasal cells seemed to select the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs. One reassortant was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and was confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that genetic reassortments between avian and swine IAVs are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract, and tissue tropism plays a crucial role in selecting for a transmissible reassortant. This study highlights the potential for feral swine to serve as an intermediate host for generating and transmitting reassortant viruses containing both avian and swine IAV genes to domestic swine and, ultimately, to humans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that transmissible reassortants arise between avian and swine IAVs in pigs through genetic reassortment in the lower respiratory tract. Tissue tropism, particularly replication ability in swine nasal epithelium cells at 33°C, is a key factor in selecting a reassortant virus that can be shed. These findings have significant implications for understanding the emergence of pandemic strains and the potential for zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses.
Title: Maternal Schistosomiasis and Praziquantel Treatment during Pregnancy: Effects on Offspring’s Susceptibility and Immune Responsiveness to Schistosoma mansoni Infection

    Abstract:
    Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni, is a significant public health concern in endemic areas. Pregnant women infected with S. mansoni may transmit the infection to their offspring in-utero, potentially influencing their immune responsiveness and susceptibility to schistosomiasis-associated morbidity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy on the prevalence and immune responsiveness of offspring to S. mansoni infection at age five years.

    Methods:
    A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Uganda, where 1343 children of mothers treated with praziquantel or placebo during pregnancy were examined for S. mansoni infection and immune responsiveness at age five years. Cytokine and antibody responses to Schistosoma worm antigen (SWA) and Schistosoma egg antigen (SEA) were measured, as well as T cell expression of FoxP3.

    Main Findings:
    The study found no significant difference in S. mansoni infection prevalence between children of treated and untreated mothers. However, cytokine (IFNγ, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) and antibody (IgG1, Ig4, and IgE) responses to SWA and SEA were higher among infected children compared to uninfected children. Notably, praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to SWA, which were higher in offspring of women treated with praziquantel.

    Implications:
    The findings suggest that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy do not significantly influence the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection or effector immune response among offspring at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA indicate that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides evidence that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy do not have a significant impact on the susceptibility and immune responsiveness of offspring to S. mansoni infection at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA suggest that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may influence immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis, which may have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the magnitude of this effect and its implications in childhood schistosomiasis.
Title: Reprogramming of Macrophage Endocytic Machinery from Receptor-Mediated Phagocytosis to Macropinocytosis in Response to Inflammatory Stimuli

    Abstract:
    Macrophage activation is a crucial step in the clearance of infectious pathogens, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Our study reveals that inflammatory stimuli induce a reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, allowing for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake. We demonstrate that expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, we show that serine phosphorylation of coronin 1 is the key molecular switch that reprograms the macrophage from a phagocytic uptake mode to macropinocytosis. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation and highlight the importance of coronin 1 phosphorylation in modulating the macrophage endocytic pathway.

    Research Question:
    How is macrophage activation coupled to increased clearance of infectious pathogens, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this process?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery in response to inflammatory stimuli. Macrophages were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines, and their endocytic activity was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that inflammatory stimuli induce a reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis. This reprogramming is mediated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of coronin 1, which activates PI3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake. We also demonstrate that expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation and highlight the importance of coronin 1 phosphorylation in modulating the macrophage endocytic pathway. This reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery is an exquisite strategy from the host immune defense point-of-view to efficiently eradicate pathogenic material.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which macrophages reprogram their endocytic machinery in response to inflammatory stimuli, allowing for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. Our findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of immune responses and the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases.

    **Title:** Community Acceptance of Tsetse Control Baits in West Nile Region, Uganda: A Comparative Study

    **Research Question:** How do communities in the West Nile region of Uganda perceive and accept tsetse control baits, and what factors influence their acceptance?

    **Methods:** We conducted 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across Arua District, Uganda. The discussions were audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to compare the views of both groups and identify salient themes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that community acceptance of tsetse control baits varies markedly between villages, despite their proximity. Villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear, anxiety, and panic when they first encountered them, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river," which are traditionally linked with physical or mental illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were fully aware of their purpose and benefits.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the success of community-based interventions against tsetse will depend on early engagements with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns that reach all communities, especially those living in areas new to such interventions. Community acceptance of traps is a vital element for effective tsetse control, as negative attitudes and associations with indigenous beliefs can lead to damage, theft, and vandalism of traps, ultimately resulting in operational failure.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of community engagement and sensitization in the deployment of tsetse control baits. Our results demonstrate that the duration of experience with tsetse control programs is a critical factor influencing community acceptance of traps. We recommend that future interventions prioritize early engagement with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns to ensure the success of tsetse control efforts in the West Nile region of Uganda and beyond.

    **Title:** High-Resolution Characterization of Genomic and Population Variation in Recombination Rates in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** How does recombination rate variation across genomes and within species influence the effectiveness of selection in natural populations?

    **Methods:** We employed a high-resolution genotyping approach to characterize the products of 5,860 female meioses in Drosophila melanogaster, genotyping a total of 139 million informative SNPs and mapping 106,964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This allowed us to generate whole-genome crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC) maps, as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals many levels of variation in recombination rates, including large-scale (100 kb) hotspots and coldspots, as well as intra-specific variation in CO landscapes associated with hotspots at low frequency. We also show that GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. At a local scale, recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks.

    **Implications:** Our findings underscore the tremendous potential for selection to act on or be associated with recombination modifiers, altering the landscape of recombination rates across the genome. The excess variance in recombination among crosses is mostly associated with CO hotspots at low frequency in our sample. These results have significant implications for population genetic models of the interaction between selection and linkage.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first coordinated high-resolution eukaryotic picture of genomic and population variation in recombination rates, distinguishing between CO and GC rates. The detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species is essential for obtaining relevant estimates of recombination rates and should be included in a new generation of population genetic models. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple layers of variation in recombination in understanding the evolutionary process and its impact on genetic variation, adaptation, and the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

    Title: Elucidating the Role of IDN2 Paralogs IDP1 and IDP2 in RNA-Directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis thaliana

    Research Question: How do IDN2 paralogs IDP1 and IDP2 function in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana, and what is the role of the IDN2 XH domain in this process?

    Methods: We employed affinity purification of IDN2 to co-purify IDP1 and IDP2, two IDN2 paralogs. We also introduced wild-type IDN2 and its mutated derivatives into the idn2 mutant for complementation testing.

    Main Findings: We found that the IDN2 coiled-coil domain is essential for IDN2 homodimerization, whereas the IDN2 C-terminal XH domain is required for IDN2 interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. The IDN2 XH domain is also necessary for the formation of the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex and for IDN2 function in RdDM. IDP1 is required for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, whereas IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. Notably, IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting that their roles differ from those of IDN2 in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex.

    Implications: Our study reveals that IDP1 and IDP2 are essential for the functioning of the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex in RdDM, and that the IDN2 XH domain plays a crucial role in this process. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying RdDM in Arabidopsis thaliana and highlight the importance of IDP1 and IDP2 in this pathway.

    Conclusions: In summary, our study demonstrates that IDP1 and IDP2 are critical components of the RdDM machinery, and that the IDN2 XH domain is essential for IDN2 function in this process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the roles of IDP1 and IDP2 in RdDM and to explore the functional specificity of the IDN2 protein family.

    **Title:** Neutrophil Response to Leishmania braziliensis Infection: Activation, Apoptosis, and Implications for Parasite Elimination

    **Research Question:** How do neutrophils respond to Leishmania braziliensis infection, and what are the implications for parasite elimination?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis using in vivo and in vitro models. Mice were inoculated with serum-opsonized L. braziliensis promastigotes, and neutrophil accumulation was measured in vivo. In vitro, inflammatory and bone marrow neutrophils were exposed to L. braziliensis, and their surface molecule expression, oxidative burst, and release of inflammatory mediators were analyzed.

    **Main Findings:** Neutrophils were rapidly recruited to the site of L. braziliensis inoculation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro, exposure to L. braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, induced the oxidative burst, and triggered the release of TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. Infected neutrophils displayed markers of early apoptosis, whereas bystander cells did not.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis, highlighting the importance of neutrophils in the early stages of Leishmania infection. The observed activation and apoptosis of neutrophils in response to L. braziliensis suggest a complex interplay between the host immune response and the parasite. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Leishmaniasis and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance parasite elimination.

    **Future Directions:** Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying neutrophil activation and apoptosis in response to L. braziliensis and to explore the potential of neutrophils as a target for Leishmaniasis treatment.
Title: Exploring the Feasibility of BCG Vaccination for Bovine Tuberculosis Control in Great Britain: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

    Abstract:
    Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) remains a significant economic burden for cattle farmers in Great Britain, primarily due to the costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements. The use of vaccination as a control measure has been hindered by the interference of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines with the tuberculin skin test, a crucial tool for determining bTB-free status. New diagnostic tests that can Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) offer a potential solution. We employed within-herd transmission models, estimated from historical data, to investigate the feasibility of supplemental BCG vaccination in Great Britain. Our results indicate that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the primary barrier to achieving a herd-level benefit of vaccination under the current testing regime. We found that a DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination without increasing the risk of missed infections. Our models suggest that a cocktail of three DIVA antigens could achieve this target specificity while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% (95% CI: 61.9, 82.9%) relative to post-mortem detection. Relaxing testing restrictions could mitigate the potential negative effects of vaccination, but this might increase the hidden burden of infection within officially TB-free herds. Our study highlights the importance of optimizing DIVA test characteristics for the effective use of BCG vaccination in bTB control programs.

    Research Question:
    Can BCG vaccination be used as a supplemental control measure for bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain, and what DIVA test characteristics are necessary to achieve a protective herd-level benefit?

    Methods:
    We employed within-herd transmission models, estimated from historical data, to explore scenarios for the use of BCG vaccination in combination with DIVA testing. We used four key measures of epidemiological and economic costs associated with bTB and testing to assess the benefit of vaccination at the herd level: the number of animals condemned as reactors (R), the number of tests (tuberculin and DIVA) needed to clear restrictions (T), the number of infected animals left in herds after restrictions are lifted (burden of infection missed by testing, B), and the number of herds that experience a breakdown before the herd clears the disease.

    Main Findings:
    Our results indicate that the specificity of the DIVA test is the primary barrier to achieving a herd-level benefit of vaccination under the current testing regime. We found that a DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination without increasing the risk of missed infections. Our models suggest that a cocktail of three DIVA antigens could achieve this target specificity while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% (95% CI: 61.9, 82.9%) relative to post-mortem detection.

    Implications:
    Our study highlights the importance of optimizing DIVA test characteristics for the effective use of BCG vaccination in bTB control programs. Relaxing testing restrictions could mitigate the potential negative effects of vaccination, but this might increase the hidden burden of infection within officially TB-free herds.

    Conclusions:
    Our findings suggest that BCG vaccination could be a useful supplemental control measure for bTB in Great Britain, but only if DIVA tests with high specificity and sensitivity are used. The development of such tests is essential for the effective use of BCG vaccination in bTB control programs.
Title: Identification of Dihydrobenzoxazepinones as a Novel Class of Anthelmintics against Trichuris trichiura

    Abstract:
    Trichuris trichiura, a parasitic whipworm, infects approximately 500 million people worldwide, hindering physical growth and educational performance. Current treatments are limited and ineffective, underscoring the need for novel anthelmintics. We employed Trichuris muris, a well-established model for T. trichiura, to screen a library of 480 novel small molecules for compounds inducing paralysis in ex vivo adult parasites. Our study identified a class of dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-one compounds exhibiting anthelmintic activity against T. muris. Further screening and resynthesis of structurally related compounds led to the identification of 20 active dihydrobenzoxazepinones, a previously unexplored chemotype in nematode control. The most potent compounds immobilized adult T. muris with EC50 values comparable to the existing anthelmintic levamisole, while demonstrating low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells, indicating selectivity for the parasite. Notably, the dihydrobenzoxazepinone OX02983 reduced the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo. These findings suggest that dihydrobenzoxazepinones represent a new class of anthelmintics active against both egg and adult stages of Trichuris parasites, with potential for further optimization to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties.

    Research Question:
    Can we identify novel small molecules with anthelmintic activity against Trichuris trichiura using Trichuris muris as a model organism?

    Methods:
    We screened a library of 480 novel small molecules for compounds inducing paralysis in ex vivo adult T. muris parasites. Subsequent hit triage and confirmatory resynthesis led to the identification of 20 active dihydrobenzoxazepinones.

    Main Findings:
    We identified a class of dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-one compounds with anthelmintic activity against T. muris. The most potent compounds immobilized adult T. muris with EC50 values comparable to levamisole, while demonstrating low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells. Notably, the dihydrobenzoxazepinone OX02983 reduced the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that dihydrobenzoxazepinones represent a new class of anthelmintics active against both egg and adult stages of Trichuris parasites. This discovery has significant implications for the development of novel treatments for trichuriasis, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions worldwide.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates the potential of dihydrobenzoxazepinones as a novel class of anthelmintics against Trichuris trichiura. Further optimization of these compounds is necessary to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties, with the ultimate goal of developing a clinical agent for the treatment of trichuriasis.

    Title: Revisiting the Date-Party Hub Dichotomy in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks

    Background: The concept of date and party hubs has been influential in understanding protein-protein interaction networks. Date hubs are characterized by low co-expression with their partners, while party hubs exhibit high co-expression. It was proposed that party hubs act as local coordinators, whereas date hubs function as global connectors.

    Research Question: We aimed to investigate whether the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a subset of highly central hubs, and whether the date-party distinction is robust to methodological changes.

    Methods: We analyzed protein-protein interaction networks using various data sets and methods to examine the topological properties of hubs and their co-expression with interaction partners.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of highly central hubs, which do not display particularly low expression correlation. We also found that the bimodal distribution of hub co-expression, which motivated the date-party distinction, is not robust to methodological changes. Furthermore, we observed significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of interacting proteins.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that thinking in terms of a date-party dichotomy for hubs in protein interaction networks is not meaningful, and it might be more useful to conceive of roles for protein-protein interactions rather than for individual proteins.

    Conclusions: We demonstrate that prior arguments in favor of a date-party dichotomy appear to be susceptible to various kinds of changes in the data and methods used. The observed differences in network vulnerability to attacks on the two hub types arise from only a small number of particularly important hubs. Our results indicate that the properties attributed to date and party hubs do not correspond well with the actual topological roles that we estimate, and that these roles are more diverse than what can be explained using a simple dichotomy.

    **Title:** Quantifying Transmission Divergence: A Limiting Factor in the Utility of Whole Genome Sequence Data for Outbreak Reconstruction

    **Research Question:** What is the impact of genetic diversity on the ability to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks from densely sampled whole genome sequence data?

    **Methods:** We introduced the concept of ‘transmission divergence’, defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. Using parameter values obtained from literature review, we simulated outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution using two models to describe transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that mean transmission divergence values vary significantly between pathogens, but are generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. We demonstrated that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, whereas sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events.

    **Implications:** Our results highlight the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios, underscoring the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data. The limited genetic diversity predicted by our simulations had a considerable impact on our ability to reconstruct outbreaks, clearly identifying transmission divergence as a limiting factor in the utility of WGS data for many pathogens in an outbreak setting.

    **Conclusions:** This study introduces the concept of transmission divergence as a measure of the informativeness of WGS data for reconstructing transmission chains during infectious disease outbreaks. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering transmission divergence when evaluating the utility of genetic sequence data for outbreak reconstruction, and highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach that incorporates multiple data types to accurately reconstruct transmission trees.

    Title: Allele-Specific Expression and Chromatin Structure of X-Linked Genes in Mouse Tissues and Cells with Skewed X Chromosome Inactivation

    Background: X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a process that silences most genes on one X chromosome in female mammals. However, some genes escape XCI and are expressed from both X chromosomes.

    Research Question: To identify escape genes in vivo and explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate XCI, we analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI.

    Methods: We used a binomial model to assess allelic expression in mouse tissues and cells with distinguishable alleles based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. RNA-seq and RT-PCR with species-specific primers or Sanger sequencing were used to validate the RNA-seq approach.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi) chromosome. We identified both common escape genes and genes with significant differences in XCI status between tissues. Few genes (3-7%) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes (21%), representing both kidney-specific escape genes and cell-line specific escape genes.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that XCI and escape from XCI are tightly controlled in vivo. The probability of bi-allelic versus mono-allelic expression was calculated using a new algorithm that can be applied to any gene in the genome. The results have implications for understanding tissue-specific sex differences and the regulation of transcription and translation.

    Conclusions: Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate XCI and escape from XCI in mouse tissues and cells. The identification of tissue-specific escape genes will help understanding of functional mechanisms leading to sex differences in these tissues. The results also highlight the importance of X/Y genes in regulating transcription and translation, which could explain why they consistently escape XCI in all tissues examined.

    **Title:** Characterization of a Novel Cysteine Protease, VX-4, from Plasmodium vivax: Implications for Malaria Parasite Metabolic Homeostasis and Egress

    **Research Question:** What are the biochemical properties and biological activities of a novel cysteine protease, VX-4, from Plasmodium vivax, and how does it contribute to the parasite's metabolic homeostasis and egress from the host erythrocyte?

    **Methods:** We identified a novel cysteine protease gene, VX-4, from the Plasmodium vivax genome and characterized its biochemical properties using recombinant protein expression and enzymatic assays. We also localized VX-4 in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax.

    **Main Findings:** VX-4 demonstrated dual substrate specificity depending on the surrounding micro-environmental pH. Its hydrolyzing activity against Z-Leu-Arg-MCA and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA was highest at acidic pH (5.5), whereas that against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA was maximal at neutral pH (6.5-7.5). VX-4 preferred positively charged amino acids and Gln at the P1 position, with less strict specificity at P3 and P4. Three amino acids that delineate the S2 pocket were substituted in VX-4 compared to VX-2 and VX-3 (Ala90, Gly157, and Glu180). Replacement of Glu180 abolished activity against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA at neutral pH, indicating the importance of this amino acid in the pH-dependent substrate preference.

    **Implications:** VX-4's pH-dependent substrate switching might offer an efficient mechanism for the specific cleavage of different substrates in different intracellular environments. VX-4 might function as a hemoglobinase in the acidic parasite food vacuole, a maturase of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 at neutral or acidic pH, and a cytoskeleton-degrading protease in the neutral erythrocyte cytosol.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the biochemical properties and biological activities of VX-4, a novel cysteine protease from Plasmodium vivax. These findings have implications for understanding the parasite's metabolic homeostasis and egress from the host erythrocyte, and highlight the potential of VX-4 as a target for antimalarial drug development.

    **Title:** Reconstruction of a Genome-Scale Model of Metabolism and Macromolecular Synthesis in Clostridium ljungdahlii Reveals New Insights into Acetogen Physiology

    **Research Question:** How can a genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) be used to gain new insights into the biology of the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii, and what are the implications for biotechnological production of commodity chemicals?

    **Methods:** A novel ME-model, named iJL965-ME, was reconstructed to capture all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model was used to predict protein allocation and media composition effects on metabolic pathways and energy conservation in C. ljungdahlii.

    **Main Findings:** The iJL965-ME model accurately predicted secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, during changing carbon and metal availability. The model also revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen. Furthermore, the model predicted and experimentally validated changing secretion rates based on different metal availability, providing new knowledge about proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.

    **Implications:** The reconstruction of the iJL965-ME model significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology, enabling new design strategies for biotechnological production of commodity chemicals. The model's ability to predict overflow metabolism, such as the formation of glycerol, a novel product for C. ljungdahlii, opens the window for fermentation optimization and provides new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.

    **Conclusions:** The iJL965-ME model represents the first ME-model of a Gram-positive bacterium and provides new insights into the biology of C. ljungdahlii. The model's ability to predict protein allocation and media composition effects on metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen has significant implications for biotechnological production of commodity chemicals. The model's predictions and experimental validation of changing secretion rates based on different metal availability provide new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens, enabling new design strategies for sustainable bioproduction.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study of Human Osteoblasts Reveals Tissue-Specific and Tissue-Independent Regulation of Transcript Isoforms by Genetic Variants

    **Background:** Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a powerful tool for identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases. However, the functional relevance of these variants remains unclear. Recent studies have used lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to assign biological relevance to genetic signals. Here, we extend this approach to human osteoblasts (HObs) to investigate the regulation of transcript isoforms by genetic variants.

    **Research Question:** Do genetic variants regulate the expression of transcript isoforms in human osteoblasts, and are these effects tissue-specific or tissue-independent?

    **Methods:** We performed a transcriptomic survey of HObs using a panel of human osteoblasts and examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with transcript isoforms using cis-association analysis. We also validated our findings using RT-PCR.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that genetic variants regulate the expression of multiple transcript isoforms in HObs, both in a tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion. We observed a 21% overlap in associations between HObs and LCLs, indicating that a significant proportion of genetic variation is common to both cell types. Furthermore, we identified novel transcript isoform variants associated with bone mineral density, including a variant in the FAM118A gene.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types to understand the functional relevance of genetic variants. The identification of tissue-specific and tissue-independent regulation of transcript isoforms by genetic variants has important implications for the interpretation of GWAS results and the identification of functional variants associated with complex diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our approach to examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types is a valuable tool for detecting the proportion of genetic variation common to different cell types and identifying cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant. This study provides new insights into the regulation of transcript isoforms in human osteoblasts and highlights the importance of considering tissue-specific and tissue-independent effects of genetic variants in the interpretation of GWAS results.
Title: Evolution of Maltotriose Utilization in Saccharomyces eubayanus through Laboratory Evolution and Gene Neofunctionalization

    Abstract:
    Saccharomyces eubayanus, a non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid S. pastorianus, is unable to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. To investigate the evolvability of maltotriose utilization in S. eubayanus CBS 12357T, we subjected maltotriose-assimilating mutants obtained after UV mutagenesis to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort. Our results show that an evolved strain exhibited improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose, indicating gene neofunctionalization had occurred. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequence identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1, and S. eubayanus SeMALT3. Our findings suggest that evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid S. pastorianus lager-brewing strains is likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those observed in this study.

    Research Question:
    Can laboratory evolution and gene neofunctionalization enable S. eubayanus CBS 12357T to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort?

    Methods:
    We subjected maltotriose-assimilating mutants obtained after UV mutagenesis to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort.

    Main Findings:
    An evolved strain exhibited improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that laboratory evolution and gene neofunctionalization can enable S. eubayanus CBS 12357T to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. This has significant implications for the brewing industry, as S. eubayanus is a non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid S. pastorianus.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates that laboratory evolution and gene neofunctionalization can enable S. eubayanus CBS 12357T to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequence identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1, and S. eubayanus SeMALT3. Our findings suggest that evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid S. pastorianus lager-brewing strains is likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those

    **Title:** Predicting Influenza Mortality Burden: A Novel Host-Virus Interaction Model Reveals a Positive Correlation between Antigenic Distance and Excess Mortality

    **Research Question:** Can a novel host-virus interaction model be developed to predict the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately estimating the antigenic distance between strains?

    **Methods:** We proposed a simplified host-virus interaction model to investigate the relationship between antigenic variations of influenza viruses and excess mortalities they cause. The model considered strains of distinct antigenicity that cause significant infection in the human population, denoted as "antigenic strains." We analyzed HA sequences of influenza A (H1N1) virus strains and developed a method, EADpred, to predict antigenic distance.

    **Main Findings:** Our study established a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each (sub)type of seasonal influenza viruses. The EADpred method accurately predicted antigenic distance with a high degree of accuracy, suggesting its potential utility in rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for influenza planning and control. By rapidly estimating the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus, our method can help formulate a cost-effective response for influenza control and prevention. This approach can also be applied to other future A (H1N1) variants and antigenic variants of human A (H3N2) and B viruses with proper modification.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel host-virus interaction model and EADpred method provide a valuable tool for predicting the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus. By accurately estimating antigenic distance, our approach can inform timely and sensible preparedness programs that balance public health gains with social and economic costs. This research has the potential to improve influenza control and prevention strategies, ultimately saving lives and reducing the economic burden of influenza outbreaks.
Title: Characterization of Phakopsora pachyrhizi Effector Candidate 23 (PpEC23) and Its Interaction with Soybean Transcription Factor GmSPL12l

    Abstract:
    The Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that causes severe soybean disease epidemics. Despite its economic importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between P. pachyrhizi and its host plant are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of a small, secreted cysteine-rich protein (SSCRP) effector candidate, PpEC23, in suppressing soybean immunity. Our results show that PpEC23 interacts with soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l, a negative regulator of soybean defenses, and that silencing GmSPL12l leads to constitutively active immunity in soybean plants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PpEC23 suppresses plant immunity and physically interacts with GmSPL12l. These findings provide evidence for a virulence function of a rust SSCRP and suggest that PpEC23 plays a key role in modulating soybean immune responses. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between P. pachyrhizi and its host plant, and has implications for the development of novel disease management strategies.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of PpEC23, a small, secreted cysteine-rich protein effector candidate, in suppressing soybean immunity and interacting with soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and plant pathology techniques to investigate the function of PpEC23. We first identified PpEC23 as a candidate effector protein from the haustorial transcriptome of P. pachyrhizi. We then used yeast two-hybrid assays to demonstrate the interaction between PpEC23 and GmSPL12l. To investigate the role of GmSPL12l in soybean immunity, we used RNA silencing to knockdown GmSPL12l expression in soybean plants.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that PpEC23 interacts with GmSPL12l, a negative regulator of soybean defenses, and that silencing GmSPL12l leads to constitutively active immunity in soybean plants. We also demonstrate that PpEC23 suppresses plant immunity and physically interacts with GmSPL12l.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide evidence for a virulence function of a rust SSCRP and suggest that PpEC23 plays a key role in modulating soybean immune responses. This study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between P. pachyrhizi and its host plant, and has implications for the development of novel disease management strategies.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between P. pachyrhizi and its host plant. The identification of PpEC23 as a virulence factor and its interaction with GmSPL12l has important implications for the development of novel disease management strategies. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of PpEC23 in modulating soybean immune responses and to explore its potential as a target for disease management.

    Title: Identification of EphA2 as a Host Cell Surface Receptor for Chlamydia trachomatis Invasion and Intracellular Signaling

    Background: Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) is an obligate intracellular bacterium that invades host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. Multiple host proteins are recruited to the inclusion and modulated to support chlamydial development.

    Research Question: What is the role of the cell surface tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) in C. trachomatis invasion and intracellular signaling?

    Methods: We used a combination of biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches to investigate the role of EphA2 in C. trachomatis infection.

    Main Findings: We identified EphA2 as a C. trachomatis adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase (PI3K) activation, promoting chlamydial replication. Interfering with C. trachomatis binding to EphA2, downregulation of EphA2 expression, or inhibition of EphA2 activity significantly reduced C. trachomatis infection. We also found that C. trachomatis interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface, resulting in C. trachomatis and receptor internalization. During chlamydial replication, EphA2 remains active and accumulates around the inclusion, interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

    Implications: Our findings provide the first evidence for a host cell surface receptor that is exploited for invasion as well as for receptor-mediated intracellular signaling to facilitate chlamydial replication. The engagement of a cell surface receptor at the inclusion membrane is a new mechanism by which C. trachomatis subverts the host cell and induces apoptosis resistance.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies EphA2 as a critical host cell surface receptor for C. trachomatis invasion and intracellular signaling. The EphA2-PI3K pathway plays a crucial role in promoting chlamydial replication, and interference with this pathway affects normal infection and renders C. trachomatis-infected cells sensitive to apoptosis induction. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of C. trachomatis infection and highlight the potential for targeting EphA2 as a therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat chlamydial infections.

    **Title:** Enhancing Dynamic Range through Active Dendritic Conductances: A Novel Role for Dendritic Excitability

    **Research Question:** What is the functional role of active dendritic conductances in neurons, and how do they contribute to dendritic computation?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model of an active dendritic tree to investigate the effects of voltage-gated ion channels on dendritic excitability. Our model simulated the response of a neuron to varying afferent rates, taking into account the properties of excitable media.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the average output of the model is a highly non-linear function of the afferent rate, exhibiting extremely large dynamic ranges (above 50 dB). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response functions, consistent with experimental observations in retinal ganglion cells. We propose that the enhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic conductances.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic ranges, and that blocking active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range. This has significant implications for our understanding of dendritic computation and the role of active dendritic conductances in signal processing.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that active dendritic conductances play a crucial role in enhancing the dynamic range of neurons, allowing them to detect and amplify weak signals while saturating slowly for stronger inputs. This property is essential for efficient signal processing in individual neurons, large neural networks, whole sensory organs, and organisms. Our results also suggest that dendritic spikes can give rise to double-sigmoid response functions, consistent with experimental observations in retinal ganglion cells. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the functional role of active dendritic conductances and highlight their importance in dendritic computation.

    **Title:** Correcting for Assumptions in Time-Series Transcriptomics Data Improves Inference of Regulatory Interactions and Gene Regulation Functions

    **Research Question:** Do commonly-made assumptions in the analysis of time-series transcriptomics data, such as equating mRNA abundance with protein concentrations and neglecting global physiological effects, bias the inference of regulatory interactions and gene regulation functions?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of models and experiments to investigate the importance of these assumptions in the context of the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network. We measured in real-time and in vivo the activity of genes involved in this module and estimated protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. Specifically, we found that accounting for global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives is crucial for accurately modeling the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering global physiological effects and protein concentrations in the analysis of time-series transcriptomics data. We propose new controls for transcriptome experiments, including the use of constitutively-expressed genes, and mathematical models and computational procedures for reconstructing protein concentrations and integrating global physiological effects into the network inference process.

    **Conclusions:** The approach proposed in this study is broadly applicable when using time-series transcriptome data to learn about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks. Our results demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters. By correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions, we can improve the quality of models inferred from time-series transcriptomics data and gain a more accurate understanding of regulatory interactions and gene regulation functions.

    **Title:** Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens Populations in Central America: Implications for Zoonotic Disease Risk

    **Research Question:** What are the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens (O. fulvescens), an important mammalian reservoir in Central America, and how do these dynamics influence the risk of zoonotic disease transmission?

    **Methods:** A longitudinal study was conducted in the community of Agua Buena in Tonosí, Panama, from April 2006 to December 2009. A 90-node grid was built to design a base map, and non-spatial analyses (box plots) and explicit spatial statistical tests (correlograms, SADIE, and LISA) were used to analyze the data.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed heterogeneous patterns in population densities and degrees of dispersion of O. fulvescens that varied across seasons and among years. The species was typically locally absent during the late transitional months of the season, and re-established locally in subsequent years. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated local populations encompassed approximately 300-600 m. The borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that O. fulvescens populations exhibit a well-defined spatial pattern that evolves over time, leading to a pattern of changing aggregation. Hotspots of abundance showed a general shifting pattern that helps explain the intermittent risk from pathogens transmitted by this species. The variation was associated with seasonality, as well as anthropogenic pressures that occurred with agricultural activities.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a detailed spatio-temporal analysis that characterizes the geographic extent of hotspots of rodent habitation and persistence. The results highlight the challenges in monitoring or predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations, which are subject to fluctuations over time (both within and among years) and are geographically restricted, even within their range. These findings have important implications for understanding the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic pathogens and for identifying disease risk.

    **Title:** Inferring Antigenic Trees for Influenza A Viruses: A Computational Method for Resolving Antigenic Impact of Amino Acid Changes

    **Research Question:** How can we develop a computational method to infer the antigenic impact of amino acid changes in the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin of influenza A viruses, and apply it to study the antigenic evolution of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2003?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational technique for inferring antigenic trees, which represents the antigenic evolution of the major surface protein of human influenza A virus (H3N2) over a 35-year period. Our method, based on a least-squares optimization (LSO) procedure, fits pairwise antigenic distances between isolates onto an evolutionary tree for the major antigenic determinant of influenza A. This approach allows for a more fine-grained resolution of the antigenic impact of individual changes than antigenic cartography without the need for time- and cost-intensive experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Our method predicted antigenic distances with comparable accuracy to antigenic cartography and identified both known and novel sites, as well as amino acid changes with antigenic impact in the evolution of influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2003. We applied our technique to study the antigenic evolution of the influenza A (H3N2) virus from 1968 to 2003 and identified areas and branches in the tree corresponding to known antigenic types and transitions between these types.

    **Implications:** Our method can be used to identify isolates and associated changes with large antigenic impact, which are crucial for vaccine strain updates prior to antigenic type transitions. Moreover, our technique can be applied to the study of any system, within or across species, where homologous genetic sequences and associated pairwise phenotype distances are available.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational method for inferring antigenic trees provides a powerful tool for resolving the antigenic impact of amino acid changes in the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin of influenza A viruses. By applying this method to the antigenic evolution of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2003, we demonstrated its ability to identify both known and novel sites with antigenic impact. Our technique has the potential to improve our understanding of the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses and inform the development of more effective vaccines.
Title: Identification of Host Cell Factors Required for Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) Infection Reveals a Novel Mechanism for Nuclear Import of Viral DNA

    Abstract:

    Background: Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) is a high-risk oncogenic virus responsible for a significant proportion of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Despite its clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying HPV16 infection remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What host cell factors and processes are required for HPV16 infection, and how does the viral DNA (vDNA) enter the host cell nucleus?

    Methods: A two-step, high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screen was employed to identify host cell factors necessary for HPV16 infection. Validated hits were further analyzed to elucidate the mechanism of vDNA import into the nucleus.

    Main Findings: The RNAi screen revealed a cluster of mitotic genes essential for HPV16 infection. Notably, nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) during mitosis was found to facilitate vDNA import into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but vDNA failed to be imported into the nucleus. In contrast, during mitosis, the vDNA and L2 protein associated with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate.

    Implications: These findings suggest that HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for access of the vDNA to the nucleoplasm. This novel mechanism highlights the importance of mitosis in HPV16 infection and underscores the value of RNAi screens in elucidating viral-host cell interactions.

    Conclusions: The identification of host cell factors required for HPV16 infection provides a valuable resource for future studies on virus-host cell interactions. Furthermore, the discovery of a novel mechanism for vDNA import into the nucleus sheds light on the complex process of HPV16 infection and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this oncogenic virus.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Genome Structure and Function of Pseudocercospora fijiensis, the Causal Agent of Black Sigatoka Disease in Banana

    **Research Question:** What is the genome structure and function of Pseudocercospora fijiensis, the causal agent of Black Sigatoka disease in banana, and how can this information be used to develop effective disease management strategies?

    **Methods:** Two strains of P. fijiensis, CIRAD86 and CIRAD139, were sequenced and assembled using a new genetic linkage map. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular marker analysis were used to study chromosome-length polymorphisms and genetic diversity in P. fijiensis field populations. Melting-curve assays were used to compare the genomes of P. fijiensis, P. eumusae, and P. musae.

    **Main Findings:** The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is characterized by a massive expansion of LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting strong selection with limited gene flow at the studied geographic scale. Frequencies of fungicide resistance in fungicide-treated plantations were higher than those in untreated wild-type P. fijiensis populations. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, was identified in the P. fijiensis genome, and infiltration of the purified PfAVR4 protein into leaves of the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4 resulted in a hypersensitive-like response.

    **Implications:** The P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat this pathogen and improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs. Diversifying and increasing the level of host resistance in banana may be the only way to slow the devastation caused by this fungus in the future.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genome structure and function of P. fijiensis, a major threat to global banana production. The availability of the P. fijiensis genome sequence and resequence data will facilitate the development of resistant cultivars in banana breeding programs and help predict spatial patterns of fungicide resistance evolution under different management strategies.

    **Title:** Identifying Lineage-Specific Regulatory Elements through a Novel Birth-Death Model

    **Research Question:** Can a birth-death model be used to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without relying on detailed cross-species alignments, and what are the implications for understanding the evolution of species-specific traits?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel framework that utilizes a birth-death model to analyze the evolution of binding sites for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1) along the human lineage after the human-mouse common ancestor. We applied this method to ChIP-seq data and estimated the evolutionary rates of binding sites for each factor.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a substantial fraction of binding sites (58-79% for each factor) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse, and over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. These lineage-specific elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome.

    **Implications:** These findings support the ability of our method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and provide insights into their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species. The results suggest that lineage-specific regulatory elements may contribute to the evolution of species-specific traits.

    **Conclusions:** Our novel framework provides a powerful tool for identifying lineage-specific regulatory elements without relying on detailed cross-species alignments. By tracing the evolution of binding sites using a birth-death model, we can gain a better understanding of how regulatory elements contribute to the evolution of species-specific traits. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation and the origins of species-specific traits.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Light-Dependent Gene Expression in the Zebrafish Circadian Clock

    **Research Question:** How does light regulate the expression of the zebrafish period2 (per2) gene, a key component of the vertebrate circadian clock?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line-based assays to investigate the regulation of per2 gene expression in response to light. We identified a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter, which is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian clock regulation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the LRM contains E- and D-box elements, which are critical for its function. The E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, while the D-box confers light-driven expression. We demonstrate that the zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. Furthermore, we show that TEF mRNA levels are light-inducible and that knock-down of TEF expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo.

    **Implications:** Our findings support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. This mechanism extends our understanding of how the clock is entrained by light and how the regulation of clock gene expression by light has evolved in vertebrates.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism that combines light-induced and clock-regulated transcriptional control. The proposed mechanism may lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon of gated light entrainment of the circadian clock and possibly other general photic cellular responses. The conservation of the LRM sequence in other vertebrate per2 genes suggests that this mechanism may be a general feature of vertebrate circadian clock regulation. Our findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of light-dependent gene expression in vertebrates and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for circadian rhythm disorders.

    Title: Coronin Regulates Gliding Motility in Plasmodium berghei Sporozoites through Actin Filament-Binding and Calcium-Dependent Signaling

    Research Question: What is the role of coronin in regulating gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite?

    Methods: We generated a series of Plasmodium berghei parasite lines that either lacked coronin, contained mutations of important residues in the β-propeller, or expressed coronin fused to mCherry. These lines were used to investigate the role of coronin in sporozoite motility and transmission efficiency.

    Main Findings: Our results show that coronin localizes to the periphery of sporozoites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and actively contributes to parasite motility through actin filament-binding. Parasites lacking coronin exhibit motility defects that impair colonization of the mosquito salivary glands but not migration in the skin, resulting in decreased transmission efficiency. We also found that protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly and that calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics.

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of coronin in regulating gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and its essential role in efficient transmission of malaria. The findings also suggest a crucial interplay between TRAP-family adhesins, actin filaments, and actin-regulating proteins for adhesion formation as a prerequisite for sporozoite migration.

    Conclusions: In conclusion, our study demonstrates that coronin is a key regulator of gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, and its dysregulation impairs parasite transmission. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sporozoite motility and highlight the potential of targeting coronin as a therapeutic strategy to prevent malaria transmission.
Title: Emergent Resistance to Amphotericin B in Leishmania mexicana: Characterization of Novel Resistance Mechanisms and Implications for Leishmaniasis Treatment

    Abstract:
    Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, poses a significant global health burden. Amphotericin B (AmB) is a crucial chemotherapeutic agent for treating leishmaniasis, but the emergence of resistance threatens its efficacy. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying AmB resistance in four novel Leishmania mexicana lines. Our results show that all resistant lines exhibit altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA-seq analysis revealed that mutations in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase and loss of expression of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) are associated with AmB resistance. Notably, the loss of SMT expression is linked to structural variations in the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy, resulting from local regions of sequence homology and the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements. Furthermore, we found that the loss of SMT expression is not accompanied by a loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring for emergent AmB resistance, particularly in the context of low-level resistance, which can predispose to higher-level resistance through the accumulation of additional mutations. These results have significant implications for the treatment of leishmaniasis, as AmB has become a first-line treatment in several settings, and a single dosing regimen has been pursued in India, increasing the risk of acquired drug resistance. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AmB resistance and underscores the need for continued surveillance and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat leishmaniasis.

    Research Question:
    What are the molecular mechanisms underlying Amphotericin B resistance in Leishmania mexicana?

    Methods:
    We selected four independent AmB-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines and performed whole-genome sequencing and RNA-seq analysis to identify genetic mutations and changes in gene expression associated with resistance.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that all resistant lines exhibit altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. We identified mutations in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase and loss of expression of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) as associated with AmB resistance. The loss of SMT expression is linked to structural variations in the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy, resulting from local regions of sequence homology and the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring for emergent AmB resistance, particularly in the context of low-level resistance, which can predispose to higher-level resistance through the accumulation of additional mutations. These results have significant implications for the treatment of leishmaniasis, as AmB has become a first-line treatment in several settings, and a single dosing regimen has been pursued in India, increasing the risk of acquired drug resistance.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AmB resistance in Leishmania mexicana and underscores the need for continued surveillance and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat leishmaniasis. The loss of SMT expression, associated with structural variations in the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy, is a significant concern, as it is not accompanied by a loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo.

    **Title:** Investigating the Interaction between Attention and Prediction in Sensory Information Processing

    **Research Question:** How do attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain, and what type of information is modulated in this interaction?

    **Methods:** In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity from human observers performing a simple visual task. Participants attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be either predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We applied forward encoding models to the EEG data to quantify the selectivity for orientation and mismatch information in the neural responses to surprising and unpredictable stimuli.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. Specifically, we found a large and significant effect of attention on mismatch response profiles in response to surprising but not unpredictable stimuli, beginning around 150 ms after stimulus onset and reaching significance from about 350 ms.

    **Implications:** These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain, and support the theory that attention optimizes precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors. Our results are consistent with a recent iteration of predictive coding theory, which proposes that attention optimizes the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that attention boosts mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli, which is consistent with the "mismatch information model" of predictive coding theory. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain, and suggest that attention optimizes the precision of predictions by increasing the gain of prediction errors.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanisms of Human Serum Resistance in Trypanosoma brucei gambiense: A Comparative Study of Group 1 and Group 2 Sub-Strains

    Abstract:
    Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a subspecies of the African trypanosome, is a significant human pathogen in sub-Saharan Africa. Two distinct sub-groups of T. b. gambiense, Group 1 and Group 2, exhibit different human serum resistance phenotypes. While Group 1 T. b. gambiense is resistant to trypanosome lytic factors (TLF-1) due to reduced expression of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HpHbR) gene, the resistance mechanism of Group 2 T. b. gambiense remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of HpHbR expression and TLF-1 internalization in Group 2 T. b. gambiense and compared it to Group 1 T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei. Our results show that both resistant and sensitive Group 2 T. b. gambiense express HpHbR at similar levels and internalize fluorescently labeled TLF-1 in a similar fashion to T. b. brucei. However, only sensitive Group 2 parasites are lysed by recombinant APOL1, suggesting that Group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to APOL1, which could be based on the same mechanism as Group 1 T. b. gambiense. Our findings indicate that Group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype, and expression does not correlate with changes in expression site or HpHbR expression. These results suggest that there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between Group 1 and Group 2 T. b. gambiense, highlighting the complexity of human serum resistance in T. b. gambiense.

    Research Question:
    What is the mechanism of human serum resistance in Group 2 T. b. gambiense, and how does it compare to Group 1 T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei?

    Methods:
    Isogenic resistant and sensitive Group 2 T. b. gambiense were derived and compared to Group 1 T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei. The expression levels of HpHbR were measured, and the internalization of fluorescently labeled TLF-1 was assessed.

    Main Findings:
    Both resistant and sensitive Group 2 T. b. gambiense express HpHbR at similar levels and internalize TLF-1 in a similar fashion to T. b. brucei. However, only sensitive Group 2 parasites are lysed by recombinant APOL1.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that Group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to APOL1, which could be based on the same mechanism as Group 1 T. b. gambiense. However, Group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype, and expression does not correlate with changes in expression site or HpHbR expression.

    Conclusions:
    Our study highlights the complexity of human serum resistance in T. b. gambiense and suggests that there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between Group 1 and Group 2 T. b. gambiense. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of human serum resistance in Group 2 T. b. gambiense.

    Title: Epigenetic Control of HIV-1 Latency by CpG Methylation of the 5′ Long Terminal Repeat (LTR)

    Research Question: What is the role of DNA methylation in the control of HIV-1 latency, and how does it contribute to the stability of latent HIV-1 proviruses?

    Methods: This study employed an in vitro model of reactivable latency and a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients to investigate the role of CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR in controlling HIV-1 latency.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals, thereby determining the stability of HIV-1 latency. We found that CpG methylation acts as a late event during the establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for the initial provirus silencing. In contrast, the latent reservoir of some aviremic patients contained high proportions of non-methylated 5′ LTR, suggesting that latency controlled solely by transcriptional interference and chromatin-dependent mechanisms is leaky and easily reactivable.

    Implications: Our findings have important implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection. We propose a two-step model of epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency, where CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an additional restriction mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an important epigenetic mechanism that maintains the latency of HIV-1 proviruses by preventing their reactivation. Our results explain the ambiguous conclusions emerging from methylation studies in cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and correlate the in vitro data with data from HIV-1-infected patients. Furthermore, our study shows the possibility of studying and acting upon the epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency in infected individuals, which could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 eradication.

    **Title:** Comprehensive Genome-Wide Catalog of Genetic and Phenotypic Variation in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation in Drosophila melanogaster, and how do different types of genetic variants contribute to gene expression variation?

    **Methods:** We generated a comprehensive genome-wide catalog of single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants in 39 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) inbred lines using whole-genome Illumina next-generation sequencing data. We employed an integrative, local assembly-based approach for variant discovery and identified over 3.6 million distinct variants, including over 800,000 unique insertions, deletions (indels), and complex variants.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a remarkably high density of molecular polymorphisms in Drosophila, with a SNP every 43 bp and an indel or complex variant every 144 bp, contributing a genetic marker every 33 bp on average. We found that indels comprise around 10% of all cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) and show larger effects than SNP cis-eQTLs. Furthermore, we identified two-fold more gene associations in males as compared to females and found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, revealing a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between the sexes.

    **Implications:** Our study provides insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in adult flies and highlights the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-biased gene expression. The comprehensive catalog of genetic and phenotypic variation in Drosophila melanogaster will serve as a valuable resource for understanding the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation in this model organism.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of an integrative approach to derive and characterize a genome-wide, nucleotide-resolution catalog of variants, including SNPs, insertions, deletions, complex substitutions, and structural variants. Our findings provide new insights into the complexity and evolution of the cis-regulatory architecture of gene expression in Drosophila and highlight the importance of considering multiple types of genetic variants in understanding the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation.

    **Title:** The Impact of Amplitude Cancellation on the Rectified Surface EMG Signal as an Estimator of Neural Drive to Muscle

    **Research Question:** Does amplitude cancellation in the rectified surface EMG signal distort its correlation with the neural drive to muscle, and if so, under what conditions?

    **Methods:** We employed analytical derivations and a computational model of motor neuron activity, force, and the EMG signal to investigate the effect of amplitude cancellation on the correlation between the rectified EMG signal and the neural drive to muscle.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that amplitude cancellation significantly impairs the ability of the rectified surface EMG signal to accurately reflect the neural drive to muscle. Analytical derivations showed that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMGnc) is a superior estimator of the neural drive compared to the actual rectified EMG signal. Simulation results confirmed this observation, revealing a linear decrease in the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive with increasing amplitude cancellation levels. Specifically, the average coefficient of determination (r2) between the neural drive in the 1-30 Hz band and EMGnc was 0.59 ± 0.08, which was only matched by the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive at low amplitude cancellation levels (<40%) and low contraction levels (<5% of maximum voluntary contraction force; MVC).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that amplitude cancellation distorts the spectrum of the rectified EMG signal, particularly for low-frequency components (<5 Hz) of the neural drive. This implies that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates that amplitude cancellation significantly impairs the ability of the rectified surface EMG signal to accurately reflect the neural drive to muscle, except in conditions with low contraction levels and/or highly variable common synaptic input. These findings have important implications for the use of rectified EMG as a tool for estimating neural drive to muscle in various physiological and pathological conditions.

    **Title:** YUCCA-Regulated Local Auxin Biosynthesis Mediates Root Growth Inhibition in Response to Aluminum Stress

    **Research Question:** How do YUCCA (YUC) proteins regulate local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone (TZ) in response to aluminum (Al) stress, leading to root growth inhibition?

    **Methods:** We used Arabidopsis thaliana mutants and transgenic lines to investigate the roles of YUC3, YUC5, YUC7, YUC8, and YUC9 in Al stress-regulated root growth inhibition. We analyzed the expression of YUC genes, auxin biosynthesis, and root growth in response to Al stress, as well as the effects of ethylene signaling and YUC activity on these processes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Al stress up-regulates YUC3, YUC5, YUC7, YUC8, and YUC9 in the root-apex TZ, leading to the accumulation of auxin and root growth inhibition. We found that ethylene signaling is involved in the regulation of YUCs in response to Al stress, and that increasing or disrupting ethylene signaling affects the up-regulation of YUCs in the root-apex TZ. We also demonstrated that YUCs are involved in the ethylene-positive modulation of auxin signaling in the root-apex TZ. Furthermore, we identified PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) as a transcriptional activator of YUC5, YUC8, and YUC9, and showed that PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating the local expression of YUCs and auxin signaling in the root-apex TZ.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a regulatory cascade for YUCs-regulated local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex TZ that mediates root growth inhibition in response to Al stress. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying root growth inhibition in response to Al stress and highlight the importance of YUCs and ethylene signaling in this process.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that YUCs play a crucial role in regulating local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex TZ in response to Al stress, leading to root growth inhibition. The identification of PIF4 as a transcriptional activator of YUCs and the involvement of ethylene signaling in this process provide new avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.

    **Title:** Modulation of Natural Killer Cell Responses by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) Peptides Bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I Molecules

    **Research Question:** How do SIV peptides bound to MHC class I molecules modulate natural killer (NK) cell responses in rhesus macaques?

    **Methods:** We investigated the functional implications of interactions between SIV peptides bound to Mamu-A1*002, a common MHC class I molecule in rhesus macaques, and Mamu-KIR3DL05, an inhibitory receptor on NK cells. We tested 75 SIV peptides bound by Mamu-A1*002 for their ability to modulate the cytolytic activity of primary Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells.

    **Main Findings:** Twenty-eight of the 75 SIV peptides bound by Mamu-A1*002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes. Substitutions at C-terminal positions changed inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory peptides, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mamu-A1*002. The functional effects of these peptide variants on NK cell responses corresponded to their effects on Mamu-A1*002 tetramer binding to Mamu-KIR3DL05. In assays with mixtures of inhibitory and disinhibitory peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory peptides dominated to suppress NK cell responses.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that viral peptides can differentially affect NK cell responses by modulating MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may evade NK cell responses. The identification of multiple viral peptides bound with high affinity by Mamu-A1*002 that enhance binding to Mamu-KIR3DL05 and suppress NK cell activation supports a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may reduce their susceptibility to NK cells by acquiring changes in epitopes that stabilize MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs.

    **Conclusions:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how SIV and potentially HIV-1 evade NK cell responses, and highlight the importance of MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs in modulating NK cell activity. Our results suggest that immunodeficiency viruses may acquire changes in epitopes that increase the binding of MHC class I ligands to inhibitory KIRs to impair NK cell killing of virus-infected cells.
Title: Microevolution of Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) in Response to Nutrient Limitation: Implications for Chronic Otitis Media

    Abstract:

    Background: Bacterial pathogens, such as NTHI, must adapt to dynamic microenvironmental stressors to survive and establish chronic infections. We hypothesized that strains adapted to survive nutrient deprivation are more adept at colonization and evasion of host immune responses, leading to persistence.

    Methods: We investigated the microevolution of NTHI in response to transient nutrient limitation using a preclinical model of NTHI-induced otitis media (OM). We detected microevolution through mutation of the icc gene, which resulted in decreased 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity.

    Main Findings: In the preclinical model, we observed a significant decrease in the recovery of effusion from ears infected with the icc mutant strain, indicating a shift in infection kinetics. In contrast, the icc mutant strain formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain early during experimental OM. Notably, the number of IBCs formed by the parental strain increased at later stages of OM, coinciding with the absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting the presence of a mucosal reservoir following resolution of clinical disease.

    Implications: These findings provide the first insight into NTHI microevolution during nutritional limitation and demonstrate the formation of IBCs in a preclinical model of chronic OM. Our results suggest that strains adapted to nutrient limitation are more adept at colonization and evasion of host immune responses, leading to persistence.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of microevolution in the adaptation of NTHI to nutrient limitation and its implications for chronic OM. The formation of IBCs by the icc mutant strain suggests a novel mechanism of persistence, which may contribute to the development of chronic OM. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of NTHI pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat chronic OM.

    Title: Modulation of Host Iron Homeostasis by Burkholderia pseudomallei Facilitates Intracellular Growth and Immune Evasion

    Research Question: How does Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, modulate host iron homeostasis to facilitate its intracellular growth and immune evasion during infection?

    Methods: Primary macrophages were infected with B. pseudomallei, and the expression of ferroportin, a key regulator of iron export, was analyzed. The effects of exogenous modification of iron export function by hepcidin or iron supplementation by ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) on intracellular iron pools and bacterial growth were investigated. Additionally, mice were infected with B. pseudomallei, and changes in hepatic ferroportin expression, iron retention, and serum iron levels were measured.

    Main Findings: Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudomallei resulted in downregulation of ferroportin expression, leading to increased intracellular iron availability. Exogenous modification of iron export function by hepcidin or iron supplementation by FAC stimulated B. pseudomallei growth, whereas the iron chelator deferoxamine reduced bacterial survival. Infection of mice with B. pseudomallei caused diminished hepatic ferroportin expression, higher iron retention in the liver, and lower serum iron levels (hypoferremia). In vivo administration of FAC tended to promote bacterial growth and inflammatory response, whereas limitation of iron availability significantly ameliorated bacterial clearance, attenuated serum cytokine levels, and improved survival of infected mice.

    Implications: Our data indicate that modulation of the cellular iron balance is a strategy employed by B. pseudomallei to improve iron acquisition and restrict antibacterial immune effector mechanisms, thereby promoting its intracellular growth. Moreover, we provide evidence that changes in host iron homeostasis can influence susceptibility to melioidosis, suggesting that iron chelating drugs might be an additional therapeutic option.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that B. pseudomallei modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate its intracellular growth and immune evasion. Our findings highlight the importance of iron homeostasis in the host-pathogen interaction and suggest that targeting iron metabolism may be a novel therapeutic approach to combat melioidosis.

    Title: Functional Mode Analysis: A Novel Technique for Identifying Collective Motions Related to Protein Function

    Research Question: How can we systematically identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their biological function?

    Background: Proteins accomplish their biological functions through collective atomic motions, but identifying these motions from molecular dynamics trajectories is often challenging. Current methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and normal mode analysis (NMA), elucidate large-scale and low-frequency modes, but do not necessarily yield collective motions directly related to protein function.

    Methods: We propose a novel technique, termed functional mode analysis (FMA), which aims to detect the collective motion maximally correlated to a specific protein function. FMA uses an ensemble of structures and an arbitrary "functional quantity" that quantifies the functional state of the protein. Two correlation measures are applied: the Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures linear correlation, and mutual information, which assesses any kind of interdependence.

    Main Findings: FMA detects the collective motion that displays the largest likelihood to induce a substantial change in the functional quantity, allowing for the derivation of a model for the functional state in terms of a single collective coordinate. We applied FMA to a number of biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein, and demonstrated its ability to identify functionally relevant collective motions.

    Implications: FMA provides a novel approach to elucidate the relationship between collective motions and protein function, which is essential for understanding protein dynamics and function. This technique can be used to identify potential targets for drug design and to understand the molecular basis of protein function and dysfunction.

    Conclusions: FMA is a powerful tool for identifying collective motions related to protein function, complementing existing methods such as PCA and NMA. By applying FMA to a range of biomolecules, we have demonstrated its ability to elucidate functionally relevant collective motions, providing new insights into protein dynamics and function.

    **Title:** Order of Intron Removal in Euglena gracilis Transcripts: A Comparative Analysis of Nonconventional and Spliceosomal Introns

    **Research Question:** What is the relative order of intron removal from Euglena gracilis transcripts of the tubA and gapC genes, which contain both nonconventional and spliceosomal introns?

    **Methods:** We examined the order of intron removal from Euglena gracilis transcripts of the tubA and gapC genes, which contain two types of introns: nonconventional and spliceosomal. The relative order of intron excision was compared for pairs of introns belonging to different types. Intermediate products of splicing were analyzed using the PacBio Next Generation Sequencing system.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that nonconventional introns are removed in a rapid manner but later than spliceosomal introns. Furthermore, we observed the accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and nonconventional introns present, suggesting the existence of a time gap between the two types of splicing.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the splicing process in Euglena gracilis and other eukaryotes that harbor nonconventional introns. The discovery of a time gap between the removal of conventional and nonconventional introns highlights the complexity of the splicing process and suggests that nonconventional introns may play a unique role in the regulation of gene expression.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the order of intron removal in Euglena gracilis transcripts and sheds light on the mechanisms of splicing in eukaryotes that harbor nonconventional introns. The results of this study have important implications for our understanding of the evolution and function of nonconventional introns and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms of splicing in eukaryotes. The discovery of nonconventional introns in marine diplonemids, a common eukaryotic group in the oceans, suggests that these introns may be widespread in eukaryotes and warrant further investigation.
Title: Subclinical Coxsackievirus B3 Infection in Juvenile Mice Triggers Late-Onset Cardiac Dysfunction through Exhaustion of Cardiac Progenitor Cells

    Abstract:

    Background: Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is an enterovirus that commonly causes self-limited febrile illness in infants, but severe cases can manifest as acute myocarditis. However, the chronic consequences of mild CVB infection remain unknown, with epidemiological evidence suggesting a link between early subclinical infections and late-onset heart failure.

    Research Question: Can subclinical CVB3 infection in juvenile mice lead to late-onset cardiac dysfunction through exhaustion of cardiac progenitor cells?

    Methods: We established a mouse model of juvenile CVB3 infection using a sublethal dose of eGFP-CVB3, which did not cause myocarditis or immune cell infiltration in the heart but triggered apoptosis or premature differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), resulting in a significant and sustained reduction in the number of CPCs within the adult heart.

    Main Findings: We observed a significant decrease in the number of CPCs in the hearts of mice infected early in life. After subjecting the mice to cardiac stress via exercise or pharmacological induction, adult mice that had sustained juvenile CVB3 infection developed marked left ventricular hypertrophy and chamber dilation. Viral protein expression (eGFP) colocalized with c-kit and Sca-1, indicating infection of CPCs in the juvenile heart.

    Implications: Our results suggest that subclinical CVB3 infection in juvenile mice may have lasting effects on the ability of adult mice to undergo compensatory vascular remodeling under cardiac stress. The exhaustion of CPCs may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load, leading to late-onset cardiac dysfunction.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a self-limited juvenile CVB3 infection may have long-term consequences for cardiac health, highlighting the importance of investigating the chronic effects of mild enterovirus infections. Our findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of heart failure and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat late-onset cardiac dysfunction.

    Title: Elucidating the Role of NLRC4 and T3SS3 in Burkholderia pseudomallei-Induced Pyroptosis and Cell Death

    Background: Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, has been shown to regulate IL-1β and IL-18 production through NLRP3 and pyroptosis via NLRC4. However, the downstream signaling pathways of these receptors and other cell death mechanisms induced during B. pseudomallei infection remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What are the roles of NLRC4 and T3SS3 in B. pseudomallei-induced pyroptosis and cell death in macrophages?

    Methods: We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of NLRC4 and T3SS3 in B. pseudomallei-induced pyroptosis and cell death. We infected macrophages with B. pseudomallei and analyzed caspase-1 processing, pyroptosis, and cell death. We also used caspase-1/11-deficient macrophages and cells transfected with wild-type and mutated T3SS3 effector proteins to dissect the signaling pathways involved.

    Main Findings: Our results show that caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis are exclusively dependent on NLRC4 in the early phase of macrophage infection, whereas at later time points, caspase-1 activation and cell death are NLRC4-independent. We identified an activation pathway involving caspases-9, -7, and PARP downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1. Furthermore, we found that the T3SS3 effector protein BopE plays a role in caspase-1 processing, and a T3SS3 inner rod protein BsaK mutant failed to activate caspase-1, leading to reduced cell death and IL-1β secretion.

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of NLRC4 and T3SS3 in B. pseudomallei-induced pyroptosis and cell death. The findings suggest that NLRC4-dependent activation of caspases-1, -9, and -7 is essential for Burkholderia-dependent PARP proteolytic inactivation during pyroptosis. The study also reveals a possible role for caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death mechanisms at later time points.

    Conclusions: In conclusion, our results indicate a major role for a functional T3SS3 in early NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis and a contribution of late caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death mechanisms in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei infection. Future studies will have to elucidate if differences in caspase activation and signaling among B. pseudomallei strains or Burkholderia spp. are linked to their virulence potential.

    **Title:** KINβγ Regulates Pollen-Stigma Interactions by Mediating Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Biogenesis in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of KINβγ in regulating pollen-stigma interactions during pollination in Arabidopsis?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of KINβγ, a plant-specific subunit of the SNF1-related protein kinase 1 complex, in regulating pollen-stigma interactions in Arabidopsis. We analyzed the subcellular localization of KINβγ in pollen grains and examined the effects of KINβγ mutations on pollen germination, hydration, and biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes.

    **Main Findings:** We found that KINβγ is a cytoplasm- and nucleus-localized protein in the vegetative cells of pollen grains in Arabidopsis. The pollen of the Arabidopsis kinβγ mutant could not germinate on the stigma, although it germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the hydration of kinβγ mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised, but adding water to the stigma promoted the germination of the mutant pollen in vivo. We also observed that the structure of mitochondria and peroxisomes was destroyed, and their numbers were significantly reduced in kinβγ mutant pollen compared to wild-type pollen. Additionally, we found that the kinβγ mutant exhibited reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for the regulation of ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is required for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. The compromised biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in kinβγ mutant pollen resulted in reduced ROS levels, leading to defective pollen germination on the stigma.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism underlying the interactions between pollen and stigma during pollination. Our findings suggest that KINβγ plays a crucial role in regulating pollen-stigma interactions by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is essential for pollen germination and hydration on the stigma.

    **Title:** Essential Role of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis Revealed through Antisense RNA-Mediated Defense against Toxin-Producing Prophages

    **Research Question:** What is the essential function of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis, and how does it contribute to the bacterium's defense against toxin-producing prophages?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of RNase III in B. subtilis using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We analyzed the growth rates of B. subtilis strains with and without the RNase III gene, as well as the expression of toxin-encoding mRNAs from the Skin and SPβ prophages. We also performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to study the mechanism of RNase III-mediated decay of the txpA mRNA when paired to its antisense RNA RatA.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is to protect the bacterium from the expression of toxin genes borne by the Skin and SPβ prophages through antisense RNA-mediated defense. We identified txpA and yonT as the two toxin-encoding mRNAs of Skin and SPβ that are sensitive to RNase III. We further demonstrated that RNase III cleaves double-stranded RNA, including the txpA mRNA paired to its antisense RNA RatA, both in vivo and in vitro.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of RNase III in B. subtilis as a key component of the bacterium's defense against viral infection. The essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is distinct from its functions in other organisms, where it is involved in ribosomal RNA maturation and mRNA turnover. Our study provides new insights into the mechanism of RNase III-mediated defense against toxin-producing prophages and has implications for understanding the evolution of bacterial defense mechanisms against viral infection.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that RNase III plays a critical role in B. subtilis by protecting the bacterium from the expression of toxin genes borne by the Skin and SPβ prophages through antisense RNA-mediated defense. Our findings provide new insights into the essential function of RNase III in B. subtilis and highlight the importance of this enzyme in bacterial defense mechanisms against viral infection.

    Title: Parasite-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Brugia malayi: Mechanisms of Effector Molecule Trafficking and Implications for Filarial Nematode Biology

    Research Question: How do Brugia malayi and other parasitic nematodes modulate host biology through the release of parasite-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing bioactive proteins and small RNA species?

    Methods: We employed Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) to quantify and size EVs released by all intra-mammalian life cycle stages of B. malayi, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male, and female worms. We also used chemical uptake inhibitors to investigate the mechanism of EV internalization by murine macrophages. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs was performed using nano-scale LC-MS/MS to identify quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome.

    Main Findings: Our results show that B. malayi EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. The use of chemical uptake inhibitors indicates that all life stage EVs are internalized by phagocytosis. Proteomic profiling revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, helping to define the biogenesis of Brugia EVs and revealing sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. Notably, ivermectin was found to rapidly inhibit EV release by all Brugia life stages, and this effect was also observed in the related filarial nematode, Dirofilaria immitis.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of effector molecule trafficking by B. malayi and other parasitic nematodes, highlighting the importance of EVs in modulating host biology. The discovery that ivermectin inhibits EV release by all Brugia life stages suggests a potential mechanism of action for this drug and may lead to new screening platforms for anti-filarial drug development.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that B. malayi releases EVs across all intra-mammalian life cycle stages, which are internalized by murine macrophages through phagocytosis. The proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs reveals sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo, providing new insights into the biogenesis of Brugia EVs. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of filarial nematode biology and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis.
Title: High Prevalence of Scabies and Impetigo in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands: A Cross-Sectional Survey

    Abstract:
    Background: Scabies and impetigo are two common and treatable skin conditions that pose a significant public health burden in many Pacific island countries, including the Solomon Islands. However, there is a scarcity of epidemiological data on these conditions in the Solomon Islands.

    Research Question: What is the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in rural communities of the Western Province of the Solomon Islands, and what are the clinical features and epidemiological associations of these conditions in this setting?

    Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ten rural villages in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands. All residents were eligible to participate, and 1908 people were enrolled. Participants were interviewed and examined by a pediatric registrar, who recorded relevant demographic information and made a clinical diagnosis of scabies and/or impetigo, severity, and distribution.

    Main Findings: The total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% (95% CI 17.5-21.0), and age and gender-weighted prevalence was 19.2% (95% CI 16.7-21.9). The adult prevalence of scabies was 10.4% (95% CI 8.2-13.2), with the highest prevalence found in infants < 1 year of age (34.1%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] compared with adults: 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-6.0) and children aged 1-4 years (25.7%, AOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.7-3.9). Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants, and 4.4% of scabies cases were classified as severe. The total unweighted prevalence of active impetigo was 32.7% (95% CI 30.6-34.8), and age and gender-weighted prevalence was 26.7% (95% CI 24.2-29.5). The highest prevalence was found in children aged 1-4 years (42.6%, AOR compared with adults: 4.1, 95% CI 2.9-5.8). Scabies infestation was associated with active impetigo infection (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6-2.6); 41.1% of active impetigo cases also had scabies.

    Implications: Scabies and impetigo are highly prevalent in the rural Western Province of the Solomon Islands, with scabies infestation being a significant risk factor for the development of active impetigo. Community control strategies for scabies may reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the need for targeted public health interventions to control scabies and impetigo in the Solomon Islands. Further development of standardized clinical criteria and algorithms for the diagnosis of scabies and impetigo in field settings would facilitate more accurate data collection and comparisons of global epidemiological data.

    **Title:** Genetic Variation in T Cell Subsets Correlates with Adult Neurogenesis in the Hippocampus

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between genetic variation in T cell subsets and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a large cohort of 719 outbred heterogeneous stock mice to investigate the correlation between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and the proportions of CD8+ versus CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to identify genetic loci that contribute to variation in cell proliferation and T cell subsets.

    **Main Findings:** We found a highly significant correlation between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and the proportions of CD8+ versus CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets. The correlation was driven by shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2Ea locus, which had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. Analysis of knockouts and repopulation of TCRα-deficient mice by subsets of T cells confirmed the influence of T cells on adult neurogenesis, indicating that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal an organismal impact of the natural genetic variation that controls T cell development and homeostasis, suggesting a broader role for T cell function on adult neurogenesis than previously suspected. The correlation between T cell subsets and neurogenesis is not an artefact of transgenic or knockout mice, but arises from the subtle cues of natural genetic variation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides novel insights into the relationship between genetic variation in T cell subsets and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The findings suggest that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof play a key role in mediating the effect of T cells on adult neurogenesis. The results have implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between the immune system and the brain, and highlight the importance of considering natural genetic variation in the study of adult neurogenesis.
Title: Efficacy of a Multi-Component DNA-Prime/Protein-Boost Vaccine (TcVac2) Against Chagas Disease in a Murine Model

Abstract:
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the United States. We investigated the protective efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine, TcVac2, in a murine model. TcVac2 was constituted of antigens identified by computational analysis of the T. cruzi sequence database and cytokine expression plasmids (IL-12 and GM-CSF). C57BL/6 mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokine adjuvants, followed by recombinant proteins, and challenged with T. cruzi trypomastigotes.

Our results show that TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response (IgG2b>IgG1) and moderate lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge infection, TcVac2-vaccinated mice expanded the IgG2b/IgG1 antibodies and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) that resulted in control of acute parasite burden. During the chronic phase, antibody response persisted, and splenic activation of CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ/TNF-α cytokines subsided, while IL-4/IL-10 cytokines became dominant in vaccinated mice. Notably, tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated chronic mice were undetectable by histological techniques.

In contrast, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T. cruzi by eliciting a mixed (type 1/type 2) antibody, T cell, and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. Our findings demonstrate that TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruzi infection and prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts. This study highlights the potential of TcVac2 as a promising vaccine candidate against Chagas disease.

    **Title:** Improving Disease Risk Assessment for Complex Diseases using Machine-Learning Approaches and Genome-Wide Association Studies

    **Background:** Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases. However, the challenge remains to quantify individual disease risk based on genotype data, enabling personalized prevention and treatment for complex diseases.

    **Research Question:** Can sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers improve the performance of disease risk assessment for type 1 diabetes (T1D)?

    **Methods:** We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a GWAS dataset generated on the Affymetrix genotyping platform for T1D and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. We tested this model on two independent datasets: an Illumina-genotyped dataset with imputed genotypes (1,008 cases and 1,000 controls) and a separate Affymetrix-genotyped dataset (1,529 cases and 1,458 controls).

    **Main Findings:** Our SVM model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ∼0.84 in both datasets, outperforming logistic regression models that used only a limited number of known susceptibility loci. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model.

    **Implications:** Our study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. This approach may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the potential of machine-learning approaches, such as SVM, to improve disease risk assessment for complex diseases like T1D. By leveraging a large ensemble of markers, we can develop more accurate models for predicting individual disease risk, enabling personalized prevention and treatment strategies. These findings have significant implications for the development of precision medicine approaches for complex diseases.

    **Title:** Memory CD8+ T cells rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues to provide protective immunity against viral infection

    **Research Question:** What is the fate of memory CD8+ T cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, during a secondary viral infection, and how do they provide protective immunity?

    **Methods:** We investigated the behavior of memory CD8+ T cells in the circulation and their ability to infiltrate the skin following Vaccinia virus (VacV) infection in mice. We used flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of surface markers and functional attributes of memory CD8+ T cells in the skin microenvironment.

    **Main Findings:** We found that memory CD8+ T cells traffic into the skin independent of CD62L-mediated lymph node homing and provide robust protective immunity against VacV infection. Central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells, but not effector memory (TEM) CD8+ T cells, differentiated into functional CD69+/CD103- tissue residents following viral clearance, which was dependent on local recognition of antigen in the skin microenvironment. Furthermore, memory CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B after trafficking into the skin and utilized cytolysis to provide protective immunity against VacV infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that TCM CD8+ T cells become cytolytic following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and subsequently differentiate into functional CD69+ tissue-residents. This study provides new insight into the protective mechanisms used by circulating memory CD8+ T cells during a secondary viral infection in peripheral tissues and highlights the importance of local antigen recognition in the skin microenvironment for the generation of functional tissue-resident memory T cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that circulating memory CD8+ T cells play a critical role in providing protective immunity against viral infection in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, and that TCM CD8+ T cells are the primary subset responsible for this function. These findings have important implications for the development of "prime-boost" vaccination strategies that aim to generate circulating memory CD8+ T cells followed by a local heterologous challenge to generate antigen-specific secondary memory T cell populations in non-lymphoid tissues.

    **Title:** Myosin VI Mediates Axonal Enrichment of Proteins through Dendrite-Specific Endocytosis

    **Research Question:** How do myosin motors contribute to the polarized distribution of axonal and dendritic proteins in neurons?

    **Methods:** We engineered non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, and observed their localization in dissociated rat cortical neurons. We also disrupted Myosin VI function or expression and examined the effects on protein localization. Furthermore, we created a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 that binds to Myosin VI and expressed it in mice in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Myosin VI plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. Engineering non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myosin VI causes them to become highly concentrated at the axonal surface. Disrupting Myosin VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. We also found evidence that Myosin VI promotes the direct trafficking of proteins to the axon and contributes to the enrichment of both axonal and dendritic proteins at the plasma membranes of the appropriate polar compartments.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that myosin motors, including Myosin VI, play a crucial role in specifying the polarized structure of neurons, which is necessary for proper electrical signaling. The presence of a vesicle filter in only one compartment could explain why axonal and dendritic proteins are trafficked by distinct mechanisms in mammalian neurons.

    **Conclusions:** Our results indicate that Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface at least in part by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis. We also show that a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, suggesting that it could be a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function. Overall, our study highlights the importance of myosin motors in shaping the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins in neurons.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Environmental Sex Determination in Daphnia magna: Identification of DapmaDsx1 as a Key Regulator of Male Phenotype

    Abstract:

    Background: Environmental sex determination (ESD) is a complex and poorly understood process, distinct from genetic sex determination (GSD). The Doublesex (Dsx) gene family plays a crucial role in controlling sexual dimorphism in various organisms, including nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ESD in Daphnia magna, a freshwater branchiopod crustacean that produces males in response to environmental cues.

    Methods: We identified two Dsx genes, DapmaDsx1 and DapmaDsx2, in Daphnia magna and examined their expression patterns during embryogenesis. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down DapmaDsx1 in male embryos and ectopically expressed DapmaDsx1 in female embryos to assess its role in sex determination.

    Main Findings: We found that DapmaDsx1 is responsible for male trait development during ESD in Daphnia magna. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 is similar to that of insect Dsx genes, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 differs from that of insects, with DapmaDsx1 exhibiting sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific splicing in the coding region. Knock-down of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits, including ovarian maturation, while ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos led to the development of male-like phenotypes.

    Implications: Our findings establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype in Daphnia magna and reveal how ESD is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using GSD. We infer that there is an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ESD in Daphnia magna and highlights the importance of DapmaDsx1 in controlling male development. Our results suggest that the expression level of DapmaDsx1 transcripts mediates sex determination in Daphnia magna, providing a new perspective on the evolution of sex-determining pathways. Further research is needed to unravel the sex-determining pathways in Daphnia magna and to understand the origin and evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in animals.
Title: Evaluation of a Trivalent HSV-2 Subunit Antigen Vaccine in Rhesus Macaques and Guinea Pigs: A Promising Approach to Preventing Genital Herpes

    Abstract:
    Genital herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), is a significant public health concern due to its association with pain, neonatal herpes, and increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. To address this pressing need, we developed and evaluated a trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine, comprising glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, gE2), administered with CpG and alum in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. Our research aimed to investigate the immunogenicity and efficacy of this vaccine in preventing genital herpes.

    Methods:
    We immunized rhesus macaques with the trivalent vaccine, comprising gC2, gD2, and gE2, administered with CpG and alum, and evaluated their immune responses, including plasma and mucosal neutralizing antibodies, antibodies blocking gC2 and gE2 immune evasion activities, and CD4 T cell responses. We also assessed the vaccine's efficacy in female guinea pigs, comparing the trivalent vaccine, gD2 alone, and a trivalent vaccine followed by a booster dose of gD2 (trivalent + gD2).

    Main Findings:
    Our results demonstrate that the trivalent vaccine induced robust immune responses in rhesus macaques, including plasma and mucosal neutralizing antibodies, antibodies blocking gC2 and gE2 immune evasion activities, and stimulated CD4 T cell responses. In guinea pigs, the trivalent and trivalent + gD2 groups showed 97% and 99% efficacy, respectively, in preventing genital lesions, outperforming gD2 alone. Notably, the trivalent + gD2 group had no shedding of replication-competent virus, while the trivalent group had genital lesions on < 1% days and shedding of replication-competent virus on 0.2% days.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that the trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine has outstanding potential for preventing genital herpes in humans. The vaccine's ability to induce robust immune responses and prevent genital lesions and shedding of replication-competent virus in guinea pigs highlights its potential to reduce the incidence of neonatal herpes and decrease the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission associated with genital herpes.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates the immunogenicity and efficacy of the trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. The vaccine's ability to induce robust immune responses and prevent genital lesions and shedding of replication-competent virus in guinea pigs makes it a promising candidate for preventing genital herpes in humans. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy in human clinical trials.

    **Title:** Perm-seq: A Prior-Enhanced Read Allocation Method for ChIP-seq Experiments Reveals Novel Protein-DNA Interactions in Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes

    **Research Question:** How can we accurately map protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)?

    **Methods:** We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, which utilizes data from DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq to improve the accuracy of multi-read allocation in highly repetitive regions of genomes.

    **Main Findings:** We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq using 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over standard methods. Our analysis revealed that Perm-seq identifies many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions, which are evolutionarily less conserved but share overall sequence characteristics with protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.

    **Implications:** The development of Perm-seq addresses a significant bottleneck in ChIP-seq data analysis, enabling the accurate mapping of protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes. This has important implications for understanding the regulatory programs of cells, particularly in the context of segmental duplications, which are associated with various diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of Perm-seq in uncovering novel protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes. By integrating multiple data sources, including DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq, Perm-seq provides a robust and versatile framework for ChIP-seq data analysis. The identification of novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplications highlights the importance of considering these regions in the study of gene regulation and their potential role in disease. Our findings have significant implications for the field of genomics and epigenomics, and we anticipate that Perm-seq will become a valuable tool for researchers seeking to understand the complex regulatory programs of cells.

    Title: Schistosomiasis and HIV-1 Acquisition: A Nested Case-Control Study in Tanzania

    Background: Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma species, affects approximately 218 million people worldwide, with the majority residing in Africa. Previous studies have suggested that individuals with chronic schistosomiasis may have an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impaired ability to control HIV-1 replication once infected. We hypothesized that pre-existing schistosome infection may increase the odds of HIV-1 acquisition and that the effects may differ between men and women, and that individuals with active schistosome infection at the time of HIV-1 acquisition may have impaired immune control of HIV-1, resulting in higher HIV-1 viral loads at HIV-1 seroconversion.

    Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study within a large population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania. A population of adults from seven villages was tested for HIV in 2007, 2010, and 2013, and dried blood spots were archived for future studies with participants' consent. Approximately 40% of this population had Schistosoma mansoni infection, and 2% had S. haematobium infection. We tested for schistosome antigens in the pre- and post-HIV-1-seroconversion blood spots of people who acquired HIV-1 and calculated the odds that a person with schistosomiasis would become HIV-1-infected compared to matched controls. Analysis was stratified by gender.

    Main Findings: Women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without (adjusted OR = 2.8 [1.2-6.6], p = 0.019). Schistosome-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition (adjusted OR = 0.7 [0.3-1.8], p = 0.42). We also found that the median whole blood HIV-1 RNA level in the 15 HIV-1 seroconverters with schistosome infection was significantly higher than in the 22 without schistosomiasis: 4.4 [3.9-4.6] log10 copies/mL versus 3.7 [3.2-4.3] log10 copies/mL, p = 0.017.

    Implications: Our study confirms that pre-existing schistosome infection increases the odds of HIV-1 acquisition in women and raises HIV-1 viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schistosome infection on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral control, and to differentiate effects by gender. Validation studies will be needed at additional sites.

    Title: Altered Ribosomal DNA Copy Number and Sequence in Cancer Genomes with mTOR Activation

    Research Question: What is the relationship between ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and sequence in cancer genomes, particularly in the context of mTOR activation?

    Methods: We employed computational and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. We used a mouse model for Pten-/- leukemia in the C57Bl6 background to assess rDNA copies in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

    Main Findings: Our results show that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Counterintuitively, human cancer genomes exhibit a loss of copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. The sequence can also be more variable in the cancer genome. Cancer genomes with lower copies have mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. Furthermore, hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia have lower rDNA copy number than normal tissue, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. Loss of copies occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that rDNA copy number may be a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA damaging treatments. Cancer stem cells with low copy number may be more sensitive to DNA damaging agents. The loss of copies is not an immediate event upon loss of PTEN and is consistent with the result in the HSCs that short-term treatment with an mTOR inhibitor is not sufficient to alter the copy number.

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes, particularly in the context of mTOR activation. The loss of rDNA copies is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage and may be a recurrent feature in cancers associated with mTOR activation. These findings suggest that targeting rDNA loci may be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Bacterial Infections within Mammalian Hosts

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanistic determinants of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts during an infection?

    **Methods:** We employed a sophisticated experimental approach to investigate the spatiotemporal population dynamics of bacteria during an infection. We analyzed simultaneous infections with tagged Salmonella enterica populations (wild-type isogenic tagged strains [WITS]) in wild-type and gene-targeted mice. WITS are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished and enumerated by quantitative PCR, allowing us to estimate bacterial death rate based on the disappearance of strains through time.

    **Main Findings:** Our analyses support a model in which shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs via bacteraemia and further stochastic selection.

    **Implications:** This study provides an unprecedented outlook on the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease. The application of our novel method in appropriate and diverse host-pathogen combinations, together with modeling of the data that result, will facilitate a comprehensive view of the spatial and stochastic nature of within-host dynamics.

    **Conclusions:** Our multidisciplinary approach has enabled us to establish the timing, relative occurrence, and immune control of key infection parameters in a true host-pathogen combination. The use of tagged wild-type strains has the potential to transform our understanding of within-host dynamics of pathogen interactions with host cells, providing the information needed to build mechanistic mathematical models, generate new research hypotheses, and make quantitative predictions.

    **Title:** Revisiting the Inverse Optics Problem of Local Binocular 3D Motion Perception

    **Research Question:** Can existing processing schemes of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity, provide a general solution to the inverse optics problem of local binocular 3D motion perception?

    **Methods:** This study evaluates existing models of 3D motion perception and proposes an alternative framework that combines local velocity constraints with binocular disparity and other depth cues to solve the inverse problem of local binocular 3D motion perception. Theoretical predictions are derived from two plausible default strategies: (1) the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D, and (2) the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that existing models of 3D motion perception are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion perception. Instead, we propose that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. We demonstrate that late integration of motion and disparity constraints, in combination with other cues, can solve the inverse problem of local 3D motion perception and allows the visual system to remain flexible when binding and segmenting local inputs from different processing stages into a global 3D motion percept.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of binocular 3D motion perception. The proposed framework suggests that the visual system uses a combination of local velocity constraints, binocular disparity, and other depth cues to disambiguate 3D motion direction and solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. This approach provides a more flexible and robust solution to the inverse optics problem, which is essential for accurate 3D motion perception.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study highlights the limitations of existing models of 3D motion perception and proposes an alternative framework that combines local velocity constraints with binocular disparity and other depth cues to solve the inverse problem of local binocular 3D motion perception. Our results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of binocular 3D motion perception and have significant implications for the development of more accurate models of 3D motion processing.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Characterization of AlgJ, a SGNH Hydrolase-Like Protein Involved in Alginate O-Acetylation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

    **Research Question:** What is the biological function of AlgJ, a protein implicated in the O-acetylation of alginate, a major component of the biofilm matrix formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients?

    **Methods:** We determined the structure of AlgJ to 1.83 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography and characterized its enzymatic activity using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assays. We also compared the binding and acetylation activities of AlgJ and AlgX, another protein involved in alginate O-acetylation.

    **Main Findings:** Our structural analysis revealed that AlgJ is a SGNH hydrolase-like protein with a conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192, and S288. We demonstrated that AlgJ exhibits acetylesterase activity in vitro and identified residues in its signature motifs that form an extensive network of interactions critical for O-acetylation of alginate in vivo. In contrast, AlgX, a two-domain protein with an N-terminal SGNH hydrolase-like domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module, binds polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner and utilizes a surrogate acetyl-donor to catalyze O-acetylation.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation, with AlgX acting as the terminal acetyltransferase. This refined model for alginate acetylation provides a rationale for the variability in the number of proteins required for polysaccharide O-acetylation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first structural and functional characterization of AlgJ, a protein involved in alginate O-acetylation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our findings highlight the importance of AlgJ and AlgX in the alginate O-acetylation pathway and provide new insights into the mechanisms of biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients.

    **Title:** Unmasking of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in Candida albicans is mediated by upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway

    **Background:** Candida albicans is a common cause of human fungal infections, and its ability to mask β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in the inner cell wall with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoproteins (mannan) allows it to evade detection by innate immune cells. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan and enhanced detection by innate immune cells.

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the unmasking of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in Candida albicans?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) synthase enzyme (Cho1) and the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways in regulating β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure in Candida albicans.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the homozygous PS synthase knockout mutant, cho1Δ/Δ, exhibits increased exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan. We found that the Cek1 and Mkc1 MAPKs are constitutively activated in cho1Δ/Δ and act downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1, respectively. Hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells increases β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure and activation of both Cek1 and Mkc1. Moreover, independent hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 leads to Cek1 activation and increased β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway is responsible for unmasking of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in Candida albicans. This discovery has important implications for the development of anti-fungal strategies that target the Cek1 MAPK pathway to enhance the detection of fungal cell wall antigens by host immune cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the unmasking of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in Candida albicans and highlights the potential of targeting the Cek1 MAPK pathway to improve anti-fungal immunity.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Neuropathologic Features

    Abstract:
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias pose a significant public health challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of their molecular pathogenesis. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Our research aimed to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and specific neuropathologic features of AD, including neuritic plaques (NPs), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI).

    Methods:
    We employed a clinico-pathologic definition of AD dementia or controls, focusing on the core neuropathologic features of AD (NPs and NFTs) in cases and controls combined, and included commonly co-morbid neuropathologic features observed in older individuals with dementia. Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD.

    Main Findings:
    Our study identified 12 of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia in our clinico-pathologic sample, including CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4. Nine of these 12 loci showed larger odds ratios in the clinico-pathologic sample. We also discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features, including GALNT7, ABCG1, and KCNMB2, which were associated with NP score and HS, respectively.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest a possible approach to genetic stratification of risk for two of the most common causes of cognitive impairment and dementia in older individuals. The correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of AD and related dementias by identifying genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features. Our results align known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias. The discovery of new genetic loci associated with specific neuropathologic features highlights the complexity of AD pathogenesis and underscores the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these characteristic lesions.
Title: Elucidating the Kinetic Role of Urea in Protein Unfolding: A Proteome-Wide Molecular Dynamics Study

    Abstract:
    Despite its widespread use as a protein denaturant, the precise mechanism by which urea induces protein unfolding remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the kinetic role of urea in unfolding a diverse set of 30 proteins, representative of all native folds. Our results reveal that urea does not passively stabilize the unfolded state, but rather actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates. We found that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins, but with a density lower than that of the fully unfolded state. Moreover, urea reduces the magnitude of spontaneous protein vibrations, leading to a counterintuitive slowdown of atomic motions that opposes unfolding. However, urea's stickiness and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding, as long-residence urea molecules placed around the hydrophobic core stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Our study provides a robust and complete picture of the role of urea in destabilizing folded states of proteins, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms by which urea accelerates protein unfolding.

    Methods:
    We performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations using a range of force-fields on a set of 30 proteins, representative of all native folds, in the presence of 8M urea at 368K. Our simulations were designed to capture the early stages of unfolding, allowing us to derive robust rules for urea unfolding that are valid at the proteome level.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins, but with a density lower than that of the fully unfolded state. We also found that urea reduces the magnitude of spontaneous protein vibrations, leading to a counterintuitive slowdown of atomic motions that opposes unfolding. Furthermore, we discovered that urea's stickiness and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding, as long-residence urea molecules placed around the hydrophobic core stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations.

    Implications:
    Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the kinetic role of urea in protein unfolding, challenging the dominant paradigm that urea passively stabilizes the unfolded state. Our findings have important implications for the development of new protein denaturants and the understanding of protein folding/unfolding mechanisms.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our proteome-wide molecular dynamics study reveals that urea actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates. Our results provide a robust and complete picture of the role of urea in destabilizing folded states of proteins, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms by which urea accelerates protein unfolding. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of protein folding/unfolding mechanisms and the development of new protein denaturants.
Title: Systematic Literature Review of Dengue Disease Epidemiology in Colombia (2000-2012): Trends, Gaps, and Implications for Public Health

    Abstract:
    This systematic literature review aimed to describe the epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia between 2000 and 2012. We conducted a comprehensive search of published literature in epidemiological studies using the terms “dengue,” “epidemiology,” and “Colombia.” A total of 225 relevant citations were identified, of which 30 met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis revealed a stable baseline annual number of dengue fever cases in Colombia, punctuated by major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. Notably, the majority of dengue disease cases were among individuals under 15 years of age. Our findings highlight several knowledge gaps in dengue disease epidemiology in Colombia, including the need for studies on asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved understanding of these factors is crucial for enhancing disease control and management. The review also underscores the importance of improved surveillance methods for dengue disease, particularly in regions with low population density, such as south and south-east Colombia. The findings of this review have significant implications for public health policy and practice in Colombia, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of dengue disease on vulnerable populations.

    **Title:** Coinfections in Tegumentary Leishmaniasis: Frequency, Interactions, and Implications for Clinical Practice

    **Research Question:** What is the frequency of coinfections in tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) patients, and how do these coinfections interact with Leishmania parasites in animal models and human subjects, influencing the clinical outcome of TL?

    **Methods:** A comprehensive review of 73 records from MEDLINE and other databases was conducted, including 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies about human subjects (mainly cross-sectional and case studies).

    **Main Findings:** Coinfections are frequent in TL patients, with reports of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina (41%) and helminthiasis in TL patients in Brazil (15-88%). Interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting the quality and quantity of acquired immune responses. Coinfections can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and may reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment.

    **Implications:** Coinfections can complicate the diagnosis and treatment of TL, and may lead to cumulative adverse effects of drug combinations. In patients with TL, coinfection is a significant concern that requires careful consideration in clinical practice.

    **Conclusions:** This review highlights the need for further research to understand the mechanisms of interaction between Leishmania and other pathogens, and to develop effective strategies for diagnosing and treating coinfections in TL patients. The frequency and impact of coinfections on the clinical outcome of TL underscore the importance of considering coinfections in the management of this disease.

    **Future Directions:** Further studies are needed to unravel the complex interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens, and to develop evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of coinfections in TL patients.

    **Title:** Genetic Variation in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Influences CD4∶CD8 Lineage Commitment and MHC Expression in Rats

    **Research Question:** How do natural genetic variations in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) affect CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats?

    **Methods:** We used two genetic models, the NIH-Heterogenous Stock (HS) rats and a panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains, to assess the impact of genetic variation on MHC expression and CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment. We mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4∶CD8 T cell ratio using a genome-wide approach.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 10 QTLs across the genome and found that QTLs for individual traits colocalized within a region spanning the MHC. We refined the QTLs to two adjacent intervals of ∼0.25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions, respectively. An interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression as well as negative selection and lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes. We mapped this effect to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene (s) (RT1-A) in the MHC-I region.

    **Implications:** Our results show that a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC class I molecules leads to reduced negative selection of CD8SP cells. This is the first study to demonstrate how a recombination between natural alleles of genes in the MHC influences lineage commitment of T cells.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that genetic variation in the MHC influences CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between Tap2 and RT1-A in regulating MHC expression and T cell selection. These results have implications for our understanding of the evolutionary conservation of MHC genes and their role in shaping the immune system.

    Title: Chagas Disease in Spain: A Retrospective Analysis of Hospitalizations from 1997 to 2011

    Background: Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America. As the second-largest recipient of migrants from Latin America, Spain is expected to have a high number of infected patients. This study aimed to describe the evolution of Chagas disease in Spain from 1997 to 2011, focusing on hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with organ complications.

    Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study using the National Health System’s Hospital Discharge Records Database (CMBD) in Spain. We analyzed hospitalization records from 1997 to 2011, dividing the data into two periods: 1997-2004 and 2005-2011. We calculated hospitalization rates, described clinical characteristics, and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with organ complications.

    Findings: A total of 1729 hospitalization records were identified, with hospitalization rates increasing from 18 to 242.8 per 100,000 population between the two study periods. The median age was 35 years, and 74% of patients were female. The 16-45 age-group was predominantly represented (69.8%). We found that 23.4% of hospitalizations included a diagnosis of Chagas disease with organ complications. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that being male, aged 45-64 years, and having a median hospitalization cost above €3,065 were associated with hospitalizations with organ affectation.

    Implications: Our study highlights the increasing trend of Chagas disease hospitalizations in Spain, particularly since 2005. The predominant patient profile (asymptomatic women at fertile age) and the conditions associated with organ affectation underscore the need for early detection of T. cruzi infections. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeted public health efforts to prevent and control Chagas disease in Spain.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive description of Chagas disease-related hospitalizations in Spain from 1997 to 2011. Our results suggest that Chagas disease is a significant public health concern in Spain, particularly among migrant populations. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology of Chagas disease in Spain and to develop effective prevention and control strategies.

    **Title:** Discovery of a Combinatorial Genetic Pattern Associated with Psoriasis using BlocBuster: A Novel Systems-Level Approach

    **Research Question:** Can a novel systems-level approach, BlocBuster, efficiently identify combinatorial interactions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex diseases, such as psoriasis?

    **Methods:** We applied BlocBuster to genome-wide data from 929 psoriatic cases and 681 controls to identify combinatorial patterns of SNPs associated with psoriasis. BlocBuster constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks, tests the associations of these combinations with the given phenotype, and rigorously validates the results using unbiased validation methods.

    **Main Findings:** BlocBuster identified a combinatorial pattern, ps_1, consisting of 17 SNP alleles that are highly inter-correlated and exhibit a psoriatic risk association with an odds ratio of 3.64 (CI: 2.75-4.80) and Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16 in the discovery data. This pattern was replicated in independent data, demonstrating the robustness of the method.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the potential of BlocBuster to discover combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data, thereby transcending the limiting "small effects" produced by individual markers examined in isolation. This approach improves the prediction of disease susceptibility and broadens our understanding of the pathogenesis underlying psoriasis.

    **Conclusions:** BlocBuster is a novel systems-level approach that efficiently identifies combinatorial interactions of SNPs associated with complex diseases. Our results provide a genetic fingerprint of 17 SNP alleles that supplies specific information along a 211 kb span in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. This pattern was extensively computationally validated and confirmed in independent data, highlighting the potential of BlocBuster for discovering combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data.

    Title: Systematic Analysis of Chromosomal Copy Number Variations in Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum, Cerebellar Hypoplasia, and Polymicrogyria

    Background: Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG) are severe congenital brain malformations with largely unknown causes. Recent studies have implicated chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in the etiology of these disorders, but a systematic analysis of CNVs in these malformations has been lacking.

    Methods: We conducted a large-scale CNV discovery effort in 255 ACC, 220 CBLH, and 147 PMG patients, and 2,349 controls. We analyzed genic CNVs that impacted at least one gene in less than 1% of the combined population of patients and controls.

    Main Findings: We found that ACC patients had a significantly higher burden of rare genic CNVs compared to controls (p = 1.48×10−3; odds ratio [OR] = 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.89-5.39). In contrast, CBLH and PMG patients did not have a significantly higher burden of rare CNVs compared to controls. We also found that ACC patients had a higher burden of large, gene-rich CNVs, particularly deletions, compared to controls. Independent qPCR confirmation showed that 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which preferentially overlapped with de novo CNVs previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that rare CNVs, particularly those that are large and gene-rich, play a significant role in the etiology of ACC, but not CBLH or PMG. These results have important implications for the interpretation of CNV results in patients with developmental disorders and for the discovery of underlying genes and pathways.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic analysis of CNVs in ACC, CBLH, and PMG and highlights the complexity of the genetics underlying these disorders. Our findings support the hypothesis that rare CNVs contribute to the etiology of ACC, but not CBLH or PMG. Further genetic investigation is warranted for all three groups of disorders to uncover the underlying causes of these severe congenital brain malformations.

    **Title:** The Hippo Signaling Effector Yorkie Restricts Early Injury Responses and Regulates Tissue Regeneration in Planarians

    **Research Question:** How do the Hippo signaling cascade and its effector Yorkie (Yki) integrate with wounding responses to regulate tissue regeneration in the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea?

    **Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Yki expression in regenerating planarians and analyzed the effects on stem cell proliferation, transcriptional wound response, and tissue patterning. We also performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify novel wound-induced genes and examined the expression of key genes in the wound program.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Yki RNAi animals exhibit hyper-activated and prolonged wound responses, characterized by increased stem cell proliferation, heightened transcriptional wound response, and expanded epidermal and muscle cell populations. We also identified novel wound-induced genes that are de-repressed in Yki RNAi animals compared to controls. Furthermore, we found that Yki RNAi animals fail to remodel and scale tissues correctly to the size of the regenerating fragment.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Yki plays a crucial role in integrating multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning. We propose that Yki functions as a key molecule that restricts early injury responses and regulates tissue regeneration in planarians.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration in planarians and highlights the importance of Yki in regulating the wound response. The identification of novel wound-induced genes and the expanded epidermal and muscle cell populations in Yki RNAi animals provides a framework for further investigation into the mechanisms of tissue regeneration and patterning. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of regenerative abilities in animals and may inform the development of regenerative therapies in humans.

    **Title:** Exosomal Transfer of EV71 Genomic RNA and miR-146a Facilitates Viral Replication by Suppressing Type I Interferon Response

    **Research Question:** How do exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells facilitate the transfer of viral genomic RNA and miR-146a to recipient cells, and what is the role of miR-146a in suppressing type I interferon response and promoting viral replication?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of exosomes in EV71 infection by analyzing the secretion of exosomes from EV71-infected cells, the packaging of viral genomic RNA and miR-146a into exosomes, and the ability of exosomal miR-146a to suppress type I interferon response in recipient cells.

    **Main Findings:** We found that EV71 infection upregulated exosome secretion and resulted in differential packaging of viral genomic RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. Exosomal miR-146a was preferentially co-packaged with EV71 genomic RNA and was able to suppress type I interferon expression in recipient cells, facilitating viral replication. We also found that the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs), BST-2/tetherin, were involved in regulating EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. In vivo studies showed that exosomal viral RNA exhibited differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which can be functionally transferred to and facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA replication in recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that exosomes play a critical role in the transfer of EV71 genomic RNA and miR-146a between cells, and that miR-146a is a key factor in suppressing type I interferon response and promoting viral replication. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of EV71 infection and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat EV71 infection.

    **Title:** Identification of PGAM5 as a Modulator of the PINK1 Pathway in Mitochondrial Homeostasis

    **Research Question:** How do PINK1 and Parkin regulate mitochondrial activity, and what is the molecular mechanism underlying their interaction?

    **Methods:** Biochemical purification of PINK1-binding proteins from human cultured cells and genetic screening using Drosophila PINK1 (dPINK1) models to identify a molecule involved in the PINK1 pathology.

    **Main Findings:** We report that a PINK1-binding mitochondrial protein, PGAM5, modulates the PINK1 pathway. Loss of Drosophila PGAM5 (dPGAM5) suppresses the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan resulting from dPINK1 inactivation, which can be attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, dPGAM5 inactivation fails to modulate the phenotypes of parkin mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of dPGAM5 exacerbates the dPINK1 and Drosophila parkin (dParkin) phenotypes.

    **Implications:** These results suggest that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway related to maintenance of the mitochondria and that PGAM5 acts between PINK1 and Parkin, or functions independently of Parkin downstream of PINK1.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between PINK1 and Parkin in mitochondrial homeostasis. The identification of PGAM5 as a modulator of the PINK1 pathway highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of PINK1-associated Parkinson's disease (PD). Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PGAM5 regulates the PINK1 pathway and to explore the therapeutic potential of PGAM5 manipulation in PD.

    **Significance:** This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial homeostasis and the pathogenesis of PD. The identification of PGAM5 as a modulator of the PINK1 pathway provides a new avenue for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PINK1-associated PD.

**Title:** Interferon-γ plays a critical role in early host defense against Mycobacterium ulcerans infection

**Research Question:** What is the role of interferon-γ (IFNγ) in the early immune response against Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) infection?

**Methods:** We used an experimental Buruli ulcer (BU) mouse model to investigate the role of IFNγ in early host defense against M. ulcerans infection. We compared the disease progression in wild-type (WT) mice and IFNγ knockout (IFNγ-/-) mice infected with a highly virulent M. ulcerans strain.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that IFNγ is a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infection. IFNγ-/- mice displayed a faster progression of the infection compared to WT mice, characterized by faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. These findings indicate that mice lacking IFNγ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that IFNγ plays a key role in early defense against M. ulcerans infection, supporting the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU. The results suggest that the immune effector mechanisms protecting against M. ulcerans infection are similar to those active against M. tuberculosis, but are impaired by the suppression of IFNγ production after local build-up of mycolactone, a cytotoxic macrolide produced by M. ulcerans.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of IFNγ in early host defense against M. ulcerans infection and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of BU. The findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against BU, including the potential use of IFNγ-based treatments or vaccines to enhance early immune defense against M. ulcerans infection.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Hypoxia-Induced ROS Production in Mitochondria: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria under hypoxic conditions, and how does it contribute to systemic diseases?

    **Methods:** To address this question, we developed a novel methodology for constructing large sets of differential equations to mathematically analyze the mechanism of ROS generation in mitochondria. Our approach takes into account the hundreds of possible redox states formed during electron transport, including those of respiratory complex III.

    **Main Findings:** Using this methodology, we identified two steady-state modes of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III at the same microenvironmental conditions. Normally, complex III operates in a low ROS-producing mode, but temporal anoxia can switch it to a high ROS-producing state, which persists even after oxygen supply is restored. This prediction was qualitatively validated experimentally, explaining the mechanism of anoxia-induced cell damage.

    **Implications:** Recognition of bistability in complex III operation may enable novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. Our method of modeling can be widely used in systems biology studies to analyze complex bioenergetic systems.

    **Conclusions:** The lack of tools for systematic theoretical analysis of ROS production in respiratory chain induced by anoxia has hindered our understanding of this complex system. Our novel methodology addresses this gap by providing a framework for constructing differential equations that reflect the redox reactions between transporters in accordance with the known biochemical mechanism of electron transport in complex III. This approach opens a new direction for most detailed mathematical analysis of complex bioenergetic systems, enabling further expansion of the model to include other parts of the electron transport chain and central metabolism.

    Title: Elucidating the Regulatory Role of Huckebein in the Gap Gene Network of Drosophila melanogaster

    Research Question: What is the regulatory effect of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) on gap gene expression in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster?

    Methods: We employed an integrative, systems-level approach to investigate the regulatory effect of hkb on gap gene expression. Quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein were obtained and used to include hkb in gap gene circuit models. Gap gene circuits are mathematical models of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial expression data.

    Main Findings: Our models are in agreement with earlier results and extend them in two important respects. Firstly, we show that Hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback (hb) domain, but does not have any other essential function. Specifically, Hkb is required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of this domain, which is now reproduced correctly in our models. Secondly, gap gene circuits presented here are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, while previously published models were unable to reproduce any null mutants correctly.

    Implications: Our models now capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards a better, quantitative understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the regulatory role of hkb in the gap gene network of Drosophila melanogaster. The inclusion of hkb in gap gene circuit models significantly improves the biological relevance and consistency of the approach. Our models are able to reproduce the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly, providing a better understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network. This study highlights the importance of considering variability in the data and analysis of parameter determinability in gap gene circuit models.

    **Title:** Immunotherapy of Bovine Brucellosis using Phage Lysates of Brucella abortus Vaccine Strains S19 and RB51

    **Research Question:** Can phage lysates of Brucella abortus vaccine strains S19 and RB51 be used as effective immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of bovine Brucellosis, and can Brucella-specific RNA in plasma serve as a biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of therapy?

    **Methods:** In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of phage lysates of Brucella abortus vaccine strains S19 and RB51 in 21 naturally Brucellosis-affected adult cows. The animals were divided into four groups: Group I (n=6) received S19 lysate only, Group II (n=5) received RB51 lysate only, Group III (n=5) received a cocktail of S19 and RB51 lysates, and Group IV (n=5) served as controls. The phage lysates were prepared using Brucellaphage and injected subcutaneously at a dose of 2 ml.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a single dose of 2 ml of phage lysate of Brucella abortus attenuated strain RB51 alone or in combination with lysate of Brucella abortus attenuated strain S19 administered subcutaneously in naturally Brucellosis-infected adult cows successfully eliminated virulent Brucella abortus from the infected cattle in 3 months. The plasma levels of Brucella-specific 223 bp amplicon were undetectable by RT-PCR, and the blood was negative for live Brucella by culture. Furthermore, in vitro restimulation of leukocytes from RL-immunized cattle induced interferon gamma production, indicating a strong cell-mediated immune response.

    **Implications:** This study provides the first report on the use of phage lysates of Brucella abortus vaccine strains S19 and RB51 for the successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle. The use of Brucella-specific RNA in plasma as a biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of therapy offers a minimally invasive and non-destructive method for assessing the effect of therapy in live animals.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that phage lysates of Brucella abortus vaccine strains S19 and RB51 can be used as effective immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of bovine Brucellosis, and Brucella-specific RNA in plasma can serve as a biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of therapy. These results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the control of Brucellosis in cattle.

    **Title:** Chemical Genetics Reveals a Non-Redundant Requirement for Cdk2 Activity in Response to DNA Damage

    **Research Question:** What is the specific role of Cdk2 in orchestrating an effective DNA damage response in human cells?

    **Methods:** We employed chemical genetics to selectively inhibit Cdk2 activity in human cells using a mutant version of Cdk2 (Cdk2as) that is sensitized to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs. We exposed cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and analyzed the effects of Cdk2 inhibition on cell survival, DNA damage repair, and checkpoint signaling.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that transient, selective inhibition of Cdk2 after exposure to IR enhances cell-killing, indicating a specific requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage. We found that Cdk2 phosphorylates the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome gene product Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex required for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling, at a consensus CDK recognition site at Ser432. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage and identifies a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery. The tools developed here should allow us to identify additional functions and targets of Cdk2 within DNA damage response pathways.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that Cdk2 plays a critical role in orchestrating an effective DNA damage response in human cells, and that its activity is required to phosphorylate proteins de novo in response to DNA lesions. This study provides new insights into the specific functions of Cdk2 in DNA damage response pathways and highlights the importance of Cdk2 in maintaining genomic integrity.

    Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of a Non-Coding GWA Index SNP Modulating Platelet Phenotype

    Background: Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified numerous genetic loci associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits, but translating these findings into biological mechanisms remains a significant challenge. Many GWA signals map outside exons, suggesting that the associated variants may reside within regulatory regions.

    Research Question: Can the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method be used to map active regulatory elements at known loci associated with hematological quantitative traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction?

    Methods: We applied the FAIRE method in a megakaryocytic and an erythroblastoid cell line to map active regulatory elements at 62 non-redundant genetic loci representing all known associations with 11 cardiovascular traits. We generated maps of open chromatin using two different formaldehyde cross-linking times and subsequent hybridization to a custom 385,000-oligonucleotide array.

    Main Findings: We showed that the two cell types exhibit distinct patterns of open chromatin, and cell-specific open chromatin can guide the identification of functional variants. We identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22.3 in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors the common non-coding sequence variant rs342293 known to be associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing of this open chromatin region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342293 is the only putative causative variant in this region.

    Implications: Our data suggest a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding GWA index SNP modulates platelet phenotype. We demonstrated that the C- and G-alleles of rs342293 differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1, affecting PIK3CG gene expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein-protein interaction network including up- and down-regulated genes in Pik3cg knockout mice indicated that PIK3CG is associated with gene pathways with an established role in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation.

    Conclusions: Our study provides the first elucidation of a functional common variant among the known platelet quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The FAIRE method can be used to map active regulatory elements at known loci associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits, facilitating the search for underlying functional variants. Our findings highlight the importance of cell-specific open chromatin in guiding the identification of functional variants and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying platelet phenotype.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Pharmacological Blockade of Persistent Sodium Currents in Respiratory Rhythmogenesis

    **Research Question:** How do different pharmacological mechanisms of action of voltage-gated ion channel blockers influence the blockade of persistent sodium currents (INaP) in respiratory rhythmogenesis?

    **Methods:** We employed computer simulations to investigate the blockade of INaP in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) respiratory neurons via two distinct pharmacological mechanisms: pore obstruction mediated by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and altered inactivation dynamics mediated by riluzole (RZ).

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations demonstrate that the effects of INaP blockade by TTX and RZ are not equivalent, contrary to the common assumption in the field. We show that RZ fails to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network due to its specific pharmacological mechanism of action and transient inhibitory network interactions. In contrast, TTX blockade of INaP is predicted to terminate respiratory rhythmicity in the intact network. Our results also suggest that pre-I bursting in the intact network is likely dependent on both inhibitory network interactions and INaP.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block and highlights the importance of considering the pharmacological mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade. Our findings support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and predict that effective block of INaP by low concentration TTX will stop respiratory rhythm generation in the intact respiratory network.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the need for a mechanistic understanding of pharmacological blockade in the context of respiratory rhythmogenesis. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of experimental data and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for respiratory disorders. By considering the distinct mechanisms of action of TTX and RZ, we provide a more nuanced understanding of the role of INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis and highlight the potential for TTX to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network.
Title: MicroRNA-218 Regulates Gastric Cancer Metastasis through a Slit-miR-218-Robo1 Regulatory Circuit

    Abstract:
    Metastasis is a hallmark of cancer progression, and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-218 (miR-218) in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. We found that miR-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC, and its host gene, Slit3, is also downregulated. However, miR-218 negatively regulates Robo1, a Slit receptor, establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, leading to the activation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway, which triggers tumor metastasis. Our results demonstrate that restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We propose a Slit-miR-218-Robo1 regulatory circuit whose disruption may contribute to GC metastasis. Targeting miR-218 may provide a novel strategy for blocking tumor metastasis.

    Methods:
    We generated a Robo1 expression construct containing a fragment of the predicted miR-218 binding site and a Robo1 mutant expression vector lacking the 3′-UTR. We also made Robo1 siRNA to test whether Robo1 is functionally regulated by miR-218. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40 cases of gastric cancer, matched adjacent normal tissues, and 29 matched metastases to confirm the inverse relationship between miR-218 and Robo1 expression.

    Main Findings:
    We found that miR-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC, and its host gene, Slit3, is also downregulated. However, miR-218 negatively regulates Robo1, a Slit receptor, establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, leading to the activation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway, which triggers tumor metastasis. Restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the metastatic mechanisms in GC and reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling. The Slit-miR-218-Robo1 regulatory circuit may contribute to GC metastasis, and targeting miR-218 may provide a novel strategy for blocking tumor metastasis.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study demonstrates that miR-218 regulates GC metastasis through a Slit-miR-218-Robo1 regulatory circuit. The disruption of this circuit may contribute to GC metastasis, and targeting miR-218 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for blocking tumor metastasis. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of miR-218 as a therapeutic target for GC metastasis.

    Title: Transcriptional Profiling Reveals a Network of Cholesterol-Responsive Atherosclerosis Genes Mediating the Beneficial Effects of Plasma Lipid Lowering Regimes

    Background: Despite the well-documented benefits of plasma lipid lowering regimes in halting atherosclerosis lesion development and reducing morbidity and mortality of coronary artery disease and stroke, the transcriptional response in the atherosclerotic lesion mediating these effects remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the transcriptional response in the atherosclerotic lesion that mediates the beneficial effects of plasma lipid lowering regimes?

    Methods: We performed transcriptional profiling at 10-week intervals in atherosclerosis-prone mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins (Ldlr−/−Apo100/100 Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre). Atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then expanded rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed.

    Main Findings: Analysis of lesion expression profiles indicated that accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages reached a point that led to the rapid expansion phase with accelerated foam-cell formation and inflammation. Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol prevented the formation of advanced plaques, and parallel transcriptional profiling of the atherosclerotic arterial wall identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation.

    Implications: Our study identifies a network of atherosclerosis genes that respond to plasma cholesterol-lowering and prevent the formation of advanced plaques. This network should be of interest for the development of novel atherosclerosis therapies.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the transcriptional response in the atherosclerotic lesion that mediates the beneficial effects of plasma lipid lowering regimes. The identification of a network of cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes and regulators of foam-cell formation opens up new avenues for the development of targeted therapies to prevent the formation of advanced plaques and reduce the risk of coronary artery disease and stroke.

    Title: Elucidating the Mechanisms of Gram-Negative Bacterial Envelope Assembly: A High-Throughput Screening Approach

    Background: Gram-negative bacteria pose a significant threat to human health due to their ability to develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs. The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex structure that is difficult for drugs to penetrate, limiting the number of effective treatments available. Understanding the mechanisms of envelope assembly is crucial for the development of new therapies.

    Research Question: What are the key factors involved in the assembly of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope, and how can this knowledge be used to identify potential drug targets?

    Methods: We developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify mutants with envelope biogenesis defects in Escherichia coli. The assay was used to screen an ordered single-gene deletion library of E. coli, resulting in the identification of 102 genes of unknown function that likely impact envelope biogenesis.

    Main Findings: The screening assay was robust and correctly identified numerous mutants known to be involved in envelope assembly. Further analysis of one of the newly identified factors, ElyC (YcbC), revealed its critical role in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides.

    Implications: The identification of ElyC and other factors involved in envelope biogenesis provides new insights into the mechanisms of Gram-negative bacterial envelope assembly. Further analysis of these factors is likely to uncover new information about the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and the vulnerabilities in the system suitable for drug targeting.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of high-throughput screening in identifying key factors involved in Gram-negative bacterial envelope assembly. The screening assay described here should be adaptable to other organisms to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures. The discovery of ElyC as a new envelope biogenesis factor highlights the potential for this approach to reveal new mechanisms underlying the envelope assembly process, which could serve as drug targets to combat Gram-negative bacterial infections.

**Title:** Systematic Data Fusion for Multivariable Dynamics in Biological Systems: A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach

**Research Question:** How can heterogeneous datasets from imaging studies of developing tissues be integrated into a coherent multivariable trajectory, revealing the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis?

**Methods:** We developed a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets to fuse heterogeneous data. We applied this approach to a dataset of ∼ 1000 images from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila, where each image reveals the spatial position of nuclei and either a timestamp or the distribution of one or several components of the DV patterning network.

**Main Findings:** By computing pairwise similarities between images using the common channel, we obtained a multivariable trajectory for the joint dynamics of tissue shape and five molecular components within the regulatory network that patterns the DV axis of the embryo. The reconstructed trajectories provide a closed-form expression for the estimated values of all variables using harmonic extension.

**Implications:** Our semi-supervised learning approach enables the integration of heterogeneous datasets from imaging studies of developing tissues, revealing the complex dynamics of multivariable processes responsible for developmental pattern formation. This approach can be readily adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further steps of data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that systematic data fusion can be successfully implemented within a semi-supervised learning framework, providing a powerful tool for studying multivariable dynamics in biological systems. Our approach has the potential to reveal the intricate relationships between gene expression, protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis, shedding light on the complex regulatory networks that govern developmental pattern formation.

    **Title:** Comparative Analysis of Snake Venom Hemorrhagic Metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of PI, PII, and PIII Classes: Tissue Localization, Hydrolysis of Basement Membrane Components, and Proteomic Analysis of Exudates

    **Research Question:** What are the differences in tissue localization, hydrolysis of basement membrane (BM) components, and proteolytic activity of SVMPs of PI, PII, and PIII classes, and how do these differences contribute to microvessel damage and hemorrhage?

    **Methods:** Immunohistochemical analysis, proteomics, and in vivo experiments were used to investigate the tissue localization and hydrolysis of BM components by SVMPs of PI, PII, and PIII classes. Exudates collected from mice injected with these enzymes were analyzed using proteomics to identify differences in proteolytic activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PII and PIII SVMPs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI SVMP, which showed a more widespread distribution in the tissue. The patterns of hydrolysis of laminin, type VI collagen, and nidogen in vivo differed among the three SVMPs, whereas type IV collagen was hydrolyzed to a similar extent by all three enzymes. Proteomic analysis of exudates revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs, with PI enzyme showing higher proteolysis of extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, and PII and PIII SVMPs showing higher amounts of intracellular proteins.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage. The selective localization of PII and PIII SVMPs in the BM of microvessels and their ability to hydrolyze type IV collagen suggest that these enzymes play a critical role in the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. The differences in proteolytic activity among the three SVMPs highlight the complexity of their pathological effects.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the tissue localization, hydrolysis of BM components, and proteolytic activity of SVMPs of PI, PII, and PIII classes. Our results support the hypothesis that the high hemorrhagic activity of PII and PIII SVMPs is due to their selective localization in the BM of microvessels and their ability to hydrolyze type IV collagen. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of microvessel damage and hemorrhage induced by SVMPs.

**Title:** Posterior Dominance Rule in Drosophila melanogaster: Unveiling the Role of iab-8 Noncoding RNA in Abd-A Repression

**Research Question:** How does the iab-8 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) contribute to the posterior dominance rule in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically in the repression of abdominal-A (abd-A) gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of the 8th abdominal segment?

**Methods:** This study employed a combination of genetic and molecular biology techniques to investigate the role of iab-8 ncRNA in abd-A repression. The authors used Drosophila melanogaster mutants and deletions to analyze the effects of iab-8 ncRNA on abd-A expression in the CNS of the 8th abdominal segment.

**Main Findings:** The results show that iab-8 ncRNA represses abd-A expression in the CNS of the 8th abdominal segment through two distinct mechanisms: (1) production of a microRNA (miRNA) that acts in trans to repress abd-A, and (2) a cis-repressive function that acts only on the chromosome from which it is transcribed. The cis-repressive function is mediated by transcriptional interference, where the iab-8 ncRNA interferes with the abd-A promoter, preventing its transcription.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the posterior dominance rule in Drosophila melanogaster. The discovery of a cis-repressive function of iab-8 ncRNA highlights the complexity of gene regulation in development and the importance of noncoding RNAs in modulating gene expression.

**Conclusions:** In summary, this study demonstrates that iab-8 ncRNA plays a crucial role in the posterior dominance rule by repressing abd-A expression in the CNS of the 8th abdominal segment through both trans-acting miRNA and cis-acting transcriptional interference mechanisms. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of gene regulation in development and highlight the importance of noncoding RNAs in modulating gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster.
Title: Investigating the Mechanisms of Focal Seizure Onset Patterns: A Computational Modeling Approach

    Abstract:
    Focal seizures, characterized by localized brain activity, exhibit two distinct onset patterns: low-amplitude fast oscillations (LAF) and high-amplitude spikes (HAS). This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these patterns using a validated computational model of neocortical tissue. Our results demonstrate that LAF and HAS onsets are associated with different mechanisms at the spatial scale of a single electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode. We found that LAF onset is initiated by localized patches of activity that slowly invade surrounding tissue, whereas HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. Notably, our model suggests that the excitability of surrounding tissue plays a crucial role in determining the seizure onset pattern and surgical outcome. Furthermore, we propose that changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of focal seizure onset and have implications for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

    Methods:
    We employed a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue and validated it using clinical recordings of focal seizures. We then reproduced the two onset patterns in their most defining properties and investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns in the model.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that LAF onset is characterized by independent patches of localized activity that slowly invade surrounding tissue, whereas HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We also found that the difference in surrounding tissue excitability offers a simple explanation of the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that the excitability of surrounding tissue may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well as in the surgical outcome. This has significant implications for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions, such as active stimulation, to modulate tissue excitability and prevent seizures.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of focal seizure onset and highlights the importance of surrounding tissue excitability in determining seizure patterns and surgical outcomes. Our results have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of focal seizures.

    Title: Unveiling the Mechanism of Pollen Tube Burst and Sperm Release in Flowering Plants: The Role of ZmES4 and KZM1

    Research Question: What are the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pollen tube growth arrest and burst leading to sperm discharge and gamete fusion in flowering plants?

    Methods: We employed a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology to investigate the role of polymorphic defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins ZmES1-4 from maize in pollen tube growth arrest and burst. We used RNAi knock-down and synthetic ZmES4 proteins to study the effects of ZmES4 on pollen tube growth and behavior. We also used channel blocker experiments and electrophysiology to investigate the role of K+-influx in pollen tube rupture.

    Main Findings: Our results show that ZmES4, a protein secreted by the synergid cells of the female gametophyte, induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. We found that ZmES4 accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells and is released during the fertilization process. We also identified the intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1 as a direct target of ZmES4, which opens at physiological membrane potentials and closes after wash-out. Our results suggest that the interaction between ZmES4 and KZM1 leads to K+ influx, water uptake, and culminates in osmotic tube burst.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pollen tube growth arrest and burst leading to sperm discharge and gamete fusion in flowering plants. The species-preferential activity of ZmES4 indicates that the mechanism described represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants.

    Conclusions: We propose a model in which vesicles containing ZmES4 are released from the synergid cells upon male-female gametophyte signaling. The interaction between ZmES4 and KZM1 results in channel opening and K+ influx, leading to water uptake and osmotic tube burst. Our study highlights the importance of ZmES4 and KZM1 in the fertilization process and provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation in plants.

    **Title:** Efficacy of HER-2-Retargeted Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Against Disseminated Tumors in Mouse Models of Ovarian and Breast Cancer

    **Research Question:** Can a HER-2-retargeted oncolytic HSV (R-LM249) effectively inhibit the growth of disseminated tumors in mouse models of ovarian and breast cancer that have spread to the peritoneum?

    **Methods:** We used immunodeficient Rag2−/−;Il2rg−/− mice implanted with human ovarian carcinoma SK-OV-3 cells or breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells, which overexpress the HER-2 oncoprotein. We administered R-LM249 systemically via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to assess its efficacy against disseminated tumors.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that i.p. administration of R-LM249 strongly inhibited the growth of ovarian and breast carcinoma disseminated to the peritoneal cavity, with 60% of mice free from peritoneal diffusion and a 95% reduction in the total weight of neoplastic nodules. We also observed a significant reduction in the growth of ovarian metastases of HER-2+ MDA-MB-453 breast cells and brain metastases. Notably, R-LM249 was effective against HER-2+ trastuzumab-resistant cells.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that HER-2-retargeted oncolytic HSV (R-LM249) is a promising therapeutic approach for treating disseminated ovarian and breast cancers that have spread to the peritoneum. The ability of R-LM249 to selectively infect and kill tumor cells expressing high levels of HER-2 oncoprotein makes it an attractive option for patients with HER-2+ tumors that are resistant to conventional therapies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the efficacy of R-LM249 against disseminated tumors in mouse models of ovarian and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of peritoneal metastases. Further studies are warranted to explore the safety and efficacy of R-LM249 in human clinical trials.

    Title: Phosphoregulation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 Restricts Centrosome Duplication to Once per Cell Cycle and Ensures Bipolar Spindle Formation

    Research Question: How is centrosome duplication controlled in eukaryotic cells, and what is the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) in this process?

    Background: Centrosome duplication is essential for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance. However, aberrant centrosome numbers are linked to chromosomal instability and are commonly observed in cancers.

    Methods: We used budding yeast as a model organism to investigate the role of Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, in centrosome duplication. We generated nonphosphorylatable mutations in Sfi1 and examined the effects on centrosome duplication, spindle formation, and cell growth.

    Main Findings: We found that reducing Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 by changing its phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and inappropriate SPB reduplication during mitosis. These cells also display defects in bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that phosphoregulation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 has a dual function: promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. We propose a model in which Cdk1 phosphorylates Sfi1 at least four C-terminal residues, allowing for SPB separation and bipolar spindle formation during mitosis.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies Sfi1 as the first Cdk substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. We provide evidence that the protein phosphatase Cdc14 has the converse role of activating licensing, likely via dephosphorylation of Sfi1. Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of centrosome duplication and the role of Cdks in regulating this process. Aberrant centrosome numbers are a hallmark of many cancers, and our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process.

    **Title:** The Role of Viral Protein R (Vpr) in HIV-1 Infection: A Humanized Mouse Model Study

    **Research Question:** What is the precise role of viral protein R (Vpr) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS?

    **Methods:** We used a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model to investigate the role of Vpr in HIV-1 infection in vivo. We infected the mice with wild-type (WT) and Vpr-deficient HIV-1 and analyzed the effects of Vpr on cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and immune activation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Vpr causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis predominantly in proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, which mainly consist of regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs). This leads to Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. The Vpr-dependent enhancement of virus replication and Treg depletion is observed in CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting that these effects are dependent on the coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation was observed in CCR5-tropic WT but not in Vpr-deficient HIV-1-infected humanized mice.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells for enhancing viremia of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Since Tregs exist in a higher cycling state than other T cell subsets, they appear to be more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides direct evidence that Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by utilizing CCR5+ proliferating CD4+ T cells, including Tregs. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-1 and the development of AIDS. The results also suggest that targeting Vpr may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat HIV-1 infection.

    **Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Plasmodium vivax Transmission in South Korea: A 15-Year Longitudinal Study Using Microsatellite DNA Markers

    **Research Question:** What is the population structure and temporal dynamics of Plasmodium vivax transmission in South Korea, and what are the implications for malaria control and elimination efforts?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 14 microsatellite DNA loci from 163 P. vivax isolates collected from 1994 to 2008 in South Korea. We used linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis, genetic differentiation, and Bayesian approach to estimate the population structure and temporal dynamics of the parasite population.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed a gradual decrease in LD levels and an increase in genetic diversity from 1994 to 2008. However, a drastic genetic change occurred in the South Korean population during 2002 and 2003, suggesting the introduction of P. vivax from other parasite population sources, possibly North Korea. Relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may also influence the population structure to some extent.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA markers for assessing the population structure and temporal dynamics of P. vivax transmission. This information can inform malaria control and elimination efforts in endemic areas.

    **Conclusions:** Our 15-year longitudinal study provides a detailed and precise understanding of the population structure and temporal dynamics of P. vivax transmission in South Korea. The results suggest that P. vivax is continually introduced into South Korea through other parasite population sources, and that North Korea may be a possible source, particularly during 2002 and 2003. These findings have significant implications for malaria control and elimination efforts in South Korea and other endemic areas. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular genetic epidemiology in assessing the population structure and temporal dynamics of P. vivax transmission, and highlights the need for continued surveillance and control measures to eliminate vivax malaria in South Korea.

    **Title:** Intron-dependent gene looping regulates promoter directionality in eukaryotes

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement of transcription by a splicing-competent intron, and how does it regulate promoter directionality in eukaryotes?

    **Methods:** We employed strand-specific transcription run-on (TRO) analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to investigate the role of introns in regulating promoter directionality in eukaryotes. We analyzed the transcription of mRNA and upstream antisense transcripts (uaRNA) initiating from the promoter in the presence and absence of an intron.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the presence of a splicing-competent intron favors the transcription of mRNA over uaRNA initiating from the promoter. Mutation of either the 5′ or 3′ splice site resulted in the reversal of promoter directionality, suggesting that the entire splicing-competent intron, not just the 5′ splice site, regulates transcription directionality. ChIP analysis revealed the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region in the presence of an intron. Removal of the intron or mutation of splice sites adversely affected the promoter localization of termination factors.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that intron-dependent gene looping is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of an intron-containing gene. We propose that the intron-dependent gene looping places the terminator-bound factors in the vicinity of the promoter region for termination of promoter-initiated upstream antisense transcription, thereby conferring promoter directionality.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the presence of a splicing-competent intron is an evolutionarily conserved feature among eukaryotes that regulates promoter directionality. The intron-dependent gene looping facilitates the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region, which is essential for the termination of promoter-initiated upstream antisense transcription. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement of transcription by a splicing-competent intron and highlight the importance of intron-dependent gene looping in regulating promoter directionality in eukaryotes.

    **Title:** Identification of ZBED6, a Novel Transcription Factor Derived from an Exapted DNA Transposon, as a Repressor of IGF2 in Placental Mammals

    **Research Question:** What is the role of ZBED6, a previously unknown transcription factor, in regulating IGF2 expression and its effects on muscle growth, size of the heart, and fat deposition in placental mammals?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and cell culture techniques to identify and characterize ZBED6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on mouse C2C12 myoblasts to identify ZBED6 binding sites in the genome. We also silenced Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts to assess its effects on IGF2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation.

    **Main Findings:** We identified ZBED6 as a novel transcription factor specific to placental mammals, derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing of Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts led to increased IGF2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. ChIP-seq analysis revealed over 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established binding site in IGF2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites were enriched for Gene Ontology classifications related to development and transcriptional regulation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth. The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts, combined with the extreme sequence conservation and broad tissue distribution of ZBED6, support its critical role in placental mammals.

    **Conclusions:** ZBED6 is a novel transcription factor derived from an exapted DNA transposon that represses IGF2 expression in placental mammals. Its silencing leads to increased IGF2 expression, cell proliferation, and altered body composition. Our study highlights the importance of ZBED6 in regulating development, cell proliferation, and growth in placental mammals. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of ZBED6 in transcriptional regulation and its potential implications for human diseases.

    Title: Comprehensive Profiling of the RNA Editome in Rhesus Macaque Reveals Widespread Functional Regulation in Primate Evolution

    Research Question: What is the accurate and quantitative profile of the RNA editome in rhesus macaque, a close relative of human, and how does it contribute to our understanding of RNA editing in primate evolution?

    Methods: We combined genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same rhesus macaque to identify 31,250 editing sites, of which 99.8% were A-to-G transitions. We verified 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions using multiple independent means.

    Main Findings: Our study revealed that adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome, with A-to-G editing sites flanked by sequences with attributes of ADAR substrates. The sequence context and expression profile of ADARs were found to be relevant factors in determining the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types. We also detected substitution valleys of decreased divergence around editing sites, suggesting evolutionary constraint in maintaining some editing substrates with their double-stranded structure.

    Implications: Our findings support the "continuous probing" model that postulates the tinkering-based origination of a small proportion of functional editing sites. The macaque editome highlights RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution, providing an informative framework for further understanding RNA editing in human.

    Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive and quantitative profile of the RNA editome in rhesus macaque, shedding light on the mechanisms and functional relevance of RNA editing in primate evolution. Our results emphasize the importance of RNA editing as a form of widespread functional regulation shaped by purifying selection, and provide a valuable resource for further interrogation of the global attributes of the RNA editome.

    **Title:** Perceptual Bias in Two-Alternative Spatial Frequency Discrimination: A Novel Effect of Spectrally Filtered Noise

    **Research Question:** How does spectrally filtered noise affect the perception of spatial frequency in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks?

    **Methods:** In this study, we used a two-alternative spatial frequency discrimination task to investigate the effect of spectrally filtered noise on the perception of grating spatial frequency. Observers were presented with gratings at high contrasts, corresponding to 84%-correct detection thresholds measured in broadband noise. We used low-pass and high-pass filtered noise to induce an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that spectrally filtered noise significantly alters the perception of two-alternative spatial frequency discrimination, shifting perceived spatial frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high-pass filtered noise conditions, respectively. This bias is not self-evident, as observers consider the log likelihood values of spatial frequencies that are a-priori unlikely to occur during the task, which lowers grating detectability and leads to a bias in perceived spatial frequency.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that observers evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives when performing two-alternative discrimination tasks. This novel perceptual bias has significant implications for our understanding of neural population decoding and signal uncertainty in visual perception.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that spectrally filtered noise can dramatically alter the perception of grating spatial frequency in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks. This effect is distinct from traditional psychophysical models of early visual encoding of gratings embedded in external noise, which assume that external noise only affects the variability of sensory responses without changing the average response. Our results highlight the importance of considering signal uncertainty in the context of neural population decoding and provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying two-alternative discrimination tasks.

    **Title:** Autonomous Transcriptional Units and Germline-Specific Expression of Piwi-Interacting RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** How are Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) expressed and regulated in Caenorhabditis elegans, and what determines their germline-specific expression?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of computational analyses and a novel, in vivo transgenic system to investigate the expression and regulation of piRNAs in C. elegans. We identified a conserved core motif that defines the piRNA transcriptional cassette, specifying expression of 21U RNAs from genomic thymidines situated at an optimal distance.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that each C. elegans piRNA represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit, requiring only a 21 nucleotide (nt) piRNA sequence and an ∼50 nt upstream motif with limited genomic context for expression. We demonstrate that this upstream motif is necessary for independent expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA. Furthermore, we found that a single nucleotide position within this motif directs differential germline enrichment. We also show that over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and comparison of the genes they target suggests that these two populations have evolved independently.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that C. elegans piRNA upstream motifs act as independent promoters to specify which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in what germline. This suggests that the genome encodes well over 15,000 unique piRNA sequences, rivaling the number of mRNA coding genes in the C. elegans genome.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into the regulation and expression of piRNAs in C. elegans, shedding light on how specific sequences are designated as piRNAs. We demonstrate that each 21U RNA locus encodes all the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from more than 15,000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of piRNA-mediated genome defense and the evolution of germline-specific expression in C. elegans.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Brucella abortus Replication within Host Cells: A Novel Role for Yip1A in ER-Derived Vacuole Formation

    **Research Question:** How do Brucella species replicate within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles, and what host factors are essential for this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology, cell biology, and microscopy techniques to investigate the mechanisms of Brucella abortus replication within host cells. We infected cells with B. abortus and analyzed the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, including IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. We also examined the expression of COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D, and the formation of ER-derived vacuoles using fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the IRE1 pathway of the UPR is activated in a time-dependent manner during B. abortus infection, leading to the upregulation of COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D. We also observed a marked accretion of ER-derived vacuoles around replicating bacteria using fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy. Furthermore, we identified a novel host factor, Yip1A, which is responsible for the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ER exit sites (ERES) under UPR conditions. Yip1A-knockdown cells failed to generate ER-derived vacuoles, and B. abortus remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that the activation of the IRE1 pathway and the subsequent formation of ER-derived vacuoles are critical for B. abortus to establish a safe replication niche within host cells. The identification of Yip1A as a pivotal host factor for this process provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Brucella replication.

    **Conclusions:** Our study proposes a model for intracellular Brucella replication that exploits the host UPR and ER-derived vacuole formation machineries, both of which depend on Yip1A-mediated IRE1 activation. The autophagy-related proteins Atg9 and WIPI1, but not DFCP1, are also required for the biogenesis of ER-derived membrane compartments. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of Brucella pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Brucellosis.

    **Title:** Tombusviruses Recruit Vps34 PI3K and PI(3)P Phosphoinositide to Support Viral Replication

    **Research Question:** How do tombusviruses, such as Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus (TBSV) and Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus (CIRV), hijack host cellular factors to support their replication?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of yeast and plant-based systems to investigate the role of Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and PI(3)P phosphoinositide in TBSV and CIRV replication. We used gene deletion analysis, overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase, and cell-free systems to study the effects of Vps34 and PI(3)P on viral replication.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that TBSV and CIRV recruit Vps34 PI3K into the large viral replication compartment, where it produces PI(3)P phosphoinositide. The kinase function of Vps34 is essential for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI(3)P is utilized by the virus to build the replication compartment. We also observed increased expression of Vps34 and higher abundance of PI(3)P in the presence of viral replication proteins, leading to more efficient viral replication. Furthermore, overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase inhibited TBSV replication on peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on mitochondrial membranes.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the critical role of Vps34 PI3K and PI(3)P phosphoinositide in supporting tombusvirus replication. The recruitment of Vps34 and PI(3)P into the replication compartment is essential for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance is decreased. Moreover, the vesicle transport function of Vps34 is required for efficient recruitment of Rab5-positive early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that Vps34 PI3K and PI(3)P phosphoinositide play a crucial role in providing the optimal microenvironment for the replication of peroxisomal TBSV and mitochondrial CIRV. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tombusvirus replication and highlight potential targets for the development of antiviral strategies.

    **Title:** Evaluating Artificial and Natural Blood Feeding Methods for Assessing Dengue Virus Transmission from Humans to Mosquitoes

    **Background:** Dengue virus (DENV) transmission from humans to mosquitoes is a critical component of dengue epidemiology. However, previous studies have been hampered by a lack of methods that accurately represent natural acquisition of DENV by mosquitoes from humans.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to compare artificial and natural blood feeding methods based on rates of DENV infection and dissemination within mosquitoes for use in a field-based epidemiological cohort study in Iquitos, Peru.

    **Methods:** Between 2011 and 2015, participants aged 5 years and older with 5 or fewer days of fever were enrolled from ongoing clinic- and neighborhood-based studies on dengue in Iquitos. Wild-type, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were fed directly on febrile individuals or on blood collected from participants that was either untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after approximately 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination.

    **Main Findings:** A total of 58 participants, with viremias ranging from 1.3 × 10^2 to 2.9 × 10^6 focus-forming units per mL of serum, participated in one or more feeding methods. DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-EDTA feeding; however, they were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. No differences were detected in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding is preferable in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides preliminary data on the ability of DENV from people with mild or inapparent disease to infect and disseminate within mosquitoes. Our findings suggest that direct mosquito feeding is a reliable method for assessing DENV transmission from humans to mosquitoes, and can be used in field-based epidemiological cohort studies.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Chemotherapeutic Drug Sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans and Human Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic basis of variability in sensitivity to anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II in Caenorhabditis elegans and human cells?

    **Methods:** We employed an unbiased genetic approach in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify the genetic basis underlying susceptibility to a panel of clinically relevant antineoplastic compounds that poison the activity of topoisomerase II enzymes. We used two unbiased genetic mapping approaches to demonstrate that divergent physiological responses to the topoisomerase II poison etoposide are determined by natural genetic variation in a C. elegans topoisomerase II enzyme.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a single amino acid variant (Q797M) in the topoisomerase II enzyme that underlies differences in etoposide response in C. elegans. Mechanistic insights into differential etoposide binding between the glutamine or methionine alleles enabled us to predict the physiological responses to an expanded panel of topoisomerase II poisons. Furthermore, we used genome-edited human cell lines to show that this residue in hTOPIIα contributes to differential toxicity of various topoisomerase II poisons.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the power of using C. elegans natural genetic variation to identify mechanisms of drug susceptibility in human cells that could inform human health decisions based on genetic information. The presence of a non-polar methionine at the Q797 residue increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and its poison etoposide, resulting in increased genomic instability in strains that contain a methionine residue. This residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms (methionine in hTOPIIα and glutamine in hTOPIIβ).

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the utility of C. elegans as a model organism for understanding the genetics of drug responses and demonstrates the importance of considering genetic variation in the development of personalized treatments and improvements to existing medications. The identification of the Q797M variant in hTOPIIα as a determinant of differential toxicity of various topoisomerase II poisons has significant implications for the development of more effective and targeted cancer therapies.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Mechanisms of Mammalian Lifespan Determination: A Comparative Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of Long-Lived Rodents

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic mechanisms underlying the determination of mammalian lifespan, and can insights from short-lived animals be transferred to long-lived mammals like humans?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 17 rodent species, focusing on eleven evolutionary branches associated with the evolution of enhanced longevity in African mole-rats (Bathyergidae). We identified positively selected genes (PSGs) and examined their expression patterns in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed 250 PSGs, which showed an expression pattern consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. These PSGs were enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, we found RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF1, a central component of aging-relevant pathways, among the PSGs.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the identified PSGs are associated with expression changes during aging in long- and short-lived rodents, consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. The PSGs are also linked to functional terms relevant to aging, such as cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and regulation by the mTOR pathway. These findings provide a meaningful resource for follow-up studies to mechanistically link identified genes and amino acids under positive selection to aging and lifespan determination.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms of mammalian lifespan determination, shedding light on the evolution of enhanced longevity in African mole-rats. The identified PSGs and their associated functional terms offer a promising starting point for understanding the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors that influence aging and lifespan in mammals.

    Title: Exploiting Wolbachia to Suppress Aedes albopictus Populations: A Novel Transinfection Strategy for Vector Control

    Background: Aedes albopictus is a primary vector of several arboviruses, including chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. Developing effective strategies to control this mosquito population is crucial for preventing the spread of these diseases. One promising approach is the exploitation of the endosymbiont Wolbachia to produce sterile males and/or invasive females with reduced vector competence.

    Research Question: Can a novel Aedes albopictus transinfection (ARwP-M) generated by introducing wMel Wolbachia in the ARwP line exhibit reduced vector competence for chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses?

    Methods: We compared various infection and fitness parameters among ARwP-M, ARwP, and wild-type (SANG population) Ae. albopictus sharing the same genetic background. We evaluated the vector competence of ARwP-M related to chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses in comparison with ARwP.

    Main Findings: ARwP-M showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia. Survival, female fecundity, and egg fertility did not differ between the three Ae. albopictus lines. Crosses between ARwP-M males and SANG females were fully unfertile, while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased from 0 to about 17% with SANG males aging from 3 to 17 days. When competing with SANG males for SANG females, ARwP-M males induced a level of sterility significantly higher than that expected for an equal mating competitiveness. The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15-fold higher than in ARwP, mostly due to the wMel infection. This feature corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses (5 and 0% rates of transmission at 14 and 21 days post-infection) with respect to ARwP females. Results regarding Zika virus did not highlight significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP, but none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable of transmitting ZIKV.

    Implications: These findings support the exploitation of Wolbachia to suppress wild-type Ae. albopictus populations. The introduction of wMel in ARwP Ae. albopictus had a profound impact on the vector competence of this line, reducing the potential to transmit chikungunya and dengue viruses.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential of ARwP-M as a novel tool for controlling Aedes albopictus populations and preventing the spread of arboviruses. The high level of sterility induced by ARwP-M males and the reduced vector competence of ARwP-M females make this transinfection strategy a promising approach for vector control.

    **Title:** Elucidating Peptide-Mediated Interactions through Structural Analysis of Protein Complexes

    **Research Question:** Can structural features of peptides be used to identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions among protein complexes of known three-dimensional (3D) structure?

    **Methods:** We analyzed all peptide-mediated interactions of known high-resolution 3D structure and found that the structure of the peptide may be as characteristic as the consensus motif. We implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) strategy that uses structural features of peptides, along with other structure-encoded information about binding interfaces, to search the set of protein interactions of known 3D structure and identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that motifs tend to have a particular stretched and elongated structure, unlike most other peptides of the same length. We derived consensus patterns for these interactions and compared our results with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. We also cross-validated our identification strategy by scanning interactome networks from four model organisms and found significant over-representations for 64 domain-motif interactions, 46 of which had not been described before, involving over 6,000 interactions in total.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that structural features of peptides can be used to identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions among protein complexes of known 3D structure. This approach can complement existing sequence-based methods for motif discovery and provide atomic details of the interface, including the binding domain of a suggested motif.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of considering structural features of peptides in the discovery of peptide-mediated interactions. By exploiting high-resolution 3D structures, we can identify novel peptide-binding domains and their respective consensus motifs, shedding light on the molecular details of these interactions. Our approach has the potential to reveal new insights into protein function and regulation, and can be applied to a wide range of biological systems.

    **Title:** Cellular Mechanisms of Impaired Barrier Function in Environmental Enteropathy: A Study of Adults in Lusaka, Zambia

    **Research Question:** What are the cellular mechanisms underlying impaired barrier function in environmental enteropathy (EE), a condition associated with growth failure, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines?

    **Methods:** We conducted a cross-sectional study of 49 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia, using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of small intestinal biopsies. We correlated these findings with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a zinc uptake test.

    **Main Findings:** CLE images revealed ubiquitous small intestinal damage, with epithelial defects predominantly seen at the tips of villi, corresponding with leakage imaged in vivo by CLE. Multivariate analysis showed that circulating log-transformed LPS was correlated with cell shedding events and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Zinc uptake from a test dose of 25mg was attenuated in 64% of individuals and was reduced by HIV, but positively correlated with GLP-2. Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that EE is characterized by epithelial defects, which are probably sites of bacterial translocation, and that increased epithelial surface area increases the burden of translocation. GLP-2 and other protective peptides may play an important role in mucosal protection in EE.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms of impaired barrier function in EE, a condition prevalent in impoverished urban African communities. Our findings highlight the importance of GLP-2 and other protective peptides in mucosal protection and suggest that biomarkers of microbial translocation and inflammation, such as LPS, may be useful in identifying individuals with EE. Further research is needed to explore the role of these biomarkers in EE and to develop effective interventions to prevent and treat this condition.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of Superinfection Exclusion in Turnip Crinkle Virus: A Novel Role for the Replication Protein p28

    Abstract:

    Background: Superinfection exclusion (SIE) is a widely observed phenomenon in which animal and plant viruses block the re-infection of host cells by the same or highly similar viruses. Despite its prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying SIE remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the molecular basis of SIE in turnip crinkle virus (TCV), and what role does the replication protein p28 play in this process?

    Methods: We employed a combination of molecular biology and cell biology techniques to investigate the role of p28 in SIE. We expressed p28 from a TCV replicon and examined its ability to exert SIE against a different TCV replicon. We also analyzed the subcellular localization of p28 and its interaction with other viral proteins.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that p28 is the primary determinant of SIE in TCV-infected cells. We show that p28 expressed from a TCV replicon exerts strong SIE against a different TCV replicon, and that transiently expressed p28 delivered simultaneously with or ahead of a TCV replicon largely recapitulates this repressive activity. We also found that p28-mediated SIE is enhanced by C-terminal modifications and inversely correlates with the ability of p28 to complement the replication of a p28-defective TCV replicon. Furthermore, we observed that p28 forms large, mobile punctate inclusions that trans-aggregate a non-coalescing, SIE-defective, yet replication-competent p28 mutant.

    Implications: Our findings support a model in which TCV SIE is caused by the formation of multimeric p28 complexes that intercept fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfectors, thereby abolishing superinfectors' replication. This model could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offers a novel target for antiviral therapy.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of SIE in TCV and highlights the critical role of p28 in this process. The identification of p28 as the primary determinant of SIE opens up new avenues for the development of antiviral therapies that target this protein. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the formation of multimeric p28 complexes may be a general mechanism of SIE among RNA viruses, providing a novel target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

    **Title:** Enhanced Long-Term Protection against Trypanosoma cruzi Infection through Co-administration of IL-15 with Trypanosoma cruzi Trans-sialidase DNA Vaccine

    **Research Question:** Can the co-administration of a plasmid encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) improve the duration of protection achieved through genetic vaccination with a plasmid encoding Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase (pTS) against acute lethal challenge?

    **Methods:** BALB/c mice were immunized with pTS in the presence or absence of pIL-15, and immune responses were studied using TS-specific IFN-γ ELISPOT, serum IgG ELISAs, intracellular cytokine staining (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2), tetramer staining, and CFSE dilution assays. Mice were challenged with a lethal dose of T. cruzi at 1 to 6 months post-vaccination.

    **Main Findings:** Mice receiving pTS alone developed robust TS-specific IFN-γ responses and survived a lethal challenge given within the first 3 months following immunization. However, the addition of pIL-15 to pTS vaccination did not significantly alter T cell responses or protection during this early post-vaccination period. Notably, mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 challenged 6 months post-vaccination were significantly more protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges than mice vaccinated with pTS alone (P < 0.05). Improved protection correlated with significantly higher numbers of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells detected >6 months post-immunization.

    **Implications:** The co-administration of pIL-15 with pTS vaccination greatly improved long-term T cell survival, memory T cell expansion, and long-term protection against T. cruzi. These findings suggest that IL-15 plays a crucial role in enhancing the durability of T cell-mediated immunity against T. cruzi.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that the combination of pIL-15 and pTS induces significantly higher levels of CD4+ Th1 cells and TS-specific IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells, which displayed enhanced proliferative capacity after antigenic restimulation compared with the levels of these responses induced by vaccination with pTS alone. These findings have important implications for the development of effective vaccines against T. cruzi, a complex intracellular protozoan pathogen that causes Chagas disease.

    Title: Identification of WDR1 as a TbPLK Receptor in the Cullin4-DDB1 Ubiquitin Ligase Complex for Regulating Basal Body Segregation and Flagellum Attachment in Trypanosoma brucei

    Background: The Polo-like kinase homolog in Trypanosoma brucei, TbPLK, plays crucial roles in basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. However, the mechanisms controlling TbPLK abundance remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of TbPLK abundance in the basal body and the bilobe of Trypanosoma brucei?

    Methods: We employed a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches, including co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunostaining, to investigate the interaction between WDR1 and TbPLK in Trypanosoma brucei.

    Main Findings: We identified a Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4WDR1, which mediates TbPLK degradation in the basal body and the bilobe. WDR1, a WD40-repeat protein, acts as a TbPLK receptor in the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex. Depletion of WDR1 impaired TbPLK ubiquitination and degradation, leading to excessive accumulation of TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe and continuous phosphorylation of the bilobe protein TbCentrin2 after S phase.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of TbPLK abundance in the basal body and the bilobe of Trypanosoma brucei. The identification of WDR1 as a TbPLK receptor in the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex highlights the importance of this complex in regulating basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that WDR1 plays a critical role in regulating TbPLK abundance in the basal body and the bilobe of Trypanosoma brucei. The CRL4WDR1 ubiquitin ligase complex is essential for degrading TbPLK, thereby promoting bilobe duplication, basal body separation, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell cycle and flagellum attachment in Trypanosoma brucei.

    **Title:** Sex-Specific Role of DDX3X in Innate Immunity Revealed through Hematopoiesis and Listeria Monocytogenes Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the role of DDX3X, a heterosomal isoform of the DEAD box RNA helicase, in the innate immune system, particularly in hematopoiesis and resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection?

    **Methods:** Mice lacking DDX3X in the hematopoietic system were generated and analyzed for alterations in leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen, as well as their ability to combat Listeria monocytogenes infection. RNA-Seq analysis was performed to examine the consequences of DDX3X deficiency on the expression of genes contributing to the innate antimicrobial response of macrophages.

    **Main Findings:** Mice lacking DDX3X showed an altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen, and a striking inability to combat Listeria monocytogenes infection. The alterations in innate immune responses resulted from decreased effector cell availability and function, as well as a sex-dependent impairment of cytokine synthesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the extent to which DDX3X deficiency altered the transcriptome depended on the sex chromosomes of the cells.

    **Implications:** Our data provide further in vivo evidence for an essential contribution of a non-RLR DExD/H RNA helicase to innate immunity and suggest that DDX3X may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates a pivotal and sex-specific role for DDX3X in the innate immune system, highlighting its importance in hematopoiesis and resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection. The findings suggest that DDX3X plays a critical role in regulating the innate antimicrobial response, particularly in macrophages, and that its deficiency may contribute to sex-related differences in immune function. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying innate immunity and the development of sex-specific therapies for infectious diseases.
Title: A Biophysical Model of Receptor Potential Generation in Male Moth Olfactory Receptor Neurons

    Abstract:

    Background: Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in male moths play a crucial role in detecting pheromone molecules, enabling them to locate pheromone-releasing females over long distances. However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying receptor potential generation in ORNs remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a comprehensive biophysical model of receptor potential generation in male moth ORNs, focusing on post-effector processes.

    Research Question: What are the biophysical mechanisms underlying receptor potential generation in male moth ORNs in response to pheromone stimulation?

    Methods: We developed a biophysical model that incorporates all pre-effector processes, including pheromone translocation, deactivation, and interaction with receptors, as well as G-protein and effector enzyme activation. The model focuses on post-effector processes, including the production and degradation of second messengers (IP3 and DAG), the opening and closing of ionic channels (IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, DAG-gated cationic channel, Ca2+-gated Cl− channel, and Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ channel), and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. The model is regulated by modulators (protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin) that exert feedback inhibition on effectors and channels.

    Main Findings: Our model captures the main features of the dose-response curves, including the wide dynamic range of six decades with amplitudes matching experimental data, short rising time, and long falling time. The model also reproduces the second messenger kinetics. Notably, our results suggest that the two main types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations: the DAG-gated cationic channel plays a major role at low concentrations, while the Ca2+-gated Cl− channel plays a major role at middle and high concentrations.

    Implications: Our model provides new insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying receptor potential generation in male moth ORNs, shedding light on the complex interactions between pheromone molecules, receptors, G-proteins, and effectors. The model's predictions can be tested experimentally, providing a framework for further research into the molecular mechanisms of pheromone detection in insects.

    Conclusions: Our biophysical model of receptor potential generation in male moth ORNs offers a comprehensive understanding of the post-effector processes involved in pheromone detection. The model's predictions and testable hypotheses provide a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms of pheromone detection in insects, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between pheromone molecules, receptors, G-proteins, and effectors.

    Title: Genome-Wide Analysis of p53 Binding and Gene Transactivation Reveals Complex Interactions between Chromatin Status and p53 Response Elements

    Research Question: How do cellular stresses activate the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to selective binding to DNA response elements (REs) and gene transactivation?

    Methods: We performed genome-wide binding localizations of p53 and H3K4me3 in untreated and doxorubicin (DXR)-treated human lymphoblastoid cells using ChIP-seq and DNase-seq. We examined the relationships among p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3K4me3, chromatin accessibility, ENCODE chromatin states, p53RE sequence, and evolutionary conservation.

    Main Findings: We observed that the inducible expression of p53-regulated genes was associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell. Most highly inducible p53-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or displayed CTCF binding. Comparison of p53RE sequences residing in different chromatin contexts demonstrated that weaker p53REs resided in open promoters, while stronger p53REs were located within enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with similarity of the target DNA sequences to the p53RE consensus, but inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility (DHS) and evolutionary conservation at the p53RE.

    Implications: Our results suggest that the interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context plays a crucial role in the induced transactivation response. We found that TE-associated p53REs were significantly stronger REs and were more highly occupied than non-repeat p53REs, but most reside in repressive, closed chromatin. This occupancy did not typically translate into induced H3K4me3 levels at nearby gene TSSs or changes in gene expression.

    Conclusions: Our study sheds new light on the complex interrelationship between chromatin state and p53RE sequence in p53 genomic occupancy and suggests the importance of considering the interactions of sequence content and epigenetic factors in interpreting p53-mediated stress responses. We propose that the p53 regulated response has been tuned via evolutionary processes that may have led to repression and/or utilization of p53REs originating from primate-specific transposon elements. Further exploration of the role of chromatin-accessibility in regulating p53 access to DNA regulatory elements is warranted.

    **Title:** Tunable Switch-Like Signal Processing in Bacterial Two-Component Signaling Systems

    **Research Question:** How does the one histidine kinase (HK)-two response regulator (RR) motif in bacterial two-component signaling systems enable rapid signal termination and sigmoidal signal-response relationships?

    **Methods:** We developed a generic model of the one HK-two RR motif and performed both analytical and simulation-based analyses to understand the system dynamics. We also experimentally reconstituted the one HK-two RR motif found in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway and measured the resulting signal-response curve.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the one HK-two RR motif allows for rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a phosphate sink towards the other RR, and implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. We identified two mathematical conditions on system parameters necessary for sigmoidal signal-response relationships and defined key parameters that control threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. We also found that the level of sigmoidality in this system can be experimentally controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to the HK.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing synthetic signaling circuits. The one HK-two RR motif provides a tunable switch-like signal processing capability, allowing bacteria and yeast to implement threshold devices for synthetic biology applications. This motif can be exploited in the construction of synthetic signaling circuits by coupling an appropriate output (e.g., an RR that can act as a transcription factor) to a useful signal that can control HK activity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a system dynamics perspective can reveal the signal processing capabilities of natural bacterial signaling pathways and provide new avenues for reengineering these systems. The one HK-two RR motif is an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications, and our findings have broad implications for any two-component signaling circuit where multiple response regulators compete for phosphorylation by a single phosphodonor.

    **Title:** Investigating Heterogeneity in Stress Tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through Single-Cell RNA Sequencing and Live-Cell Imaging

    **Research Question:** What is the nature of heterogeneity in stress tolerance among individual cells within isogenic populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and how do cellular covariates influence the stress-responsive transcriptome?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to quantify transcript heterogeneity in individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress. We also conducted live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We discovered that a subset of cells decouples expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response, partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into heterogeneity in the yeast stress response and highlight the importance of understanding the regulatory networks that control heterogeneity in transcription and stress tolerance. This knowledge may open new avenues to control population behavior and improve our understanding of stress tolerance in eukaryotic cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that individual cells within isogenic populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit significant variation in stress tolerance, which is influenced by cellular covariates such as the cell cycle. Our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation, but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of stress tolerance in eukaryotic cells and highlight the need for further research into the regulatory networks that control heterogeneity in transcription and stress tolerance.
Title: Accumulation of Trypanosoma brucei in the Male Reproductive System of Mice: Implications for Diagnosis and Pathogenesis of African Trypanosomiasis

    Abstract:

    Background: African trypanosomiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, is transmitted between mammals by the bite of a tsetse fly. Recent studies have shown that parasites accumulate in various organs and tissues, including the mouse testis. However, it remains unclear whether parasites are protected from the immune system in the male reproductive organ or can be transmitted through the sexual route.

    Methods: We investigated the accumulation of T. brucei in the male reproductive system of mice using fine needle aspiration cytology and histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry with a non-purified anti-pan VSG antibody was used to analyze the presence and distribution of trypanosomes in the testis, epididymis, and epididymal adipose tissue at different stages post-infection.

    Main Findings: Our results show that T. brucei accumulates in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of intact epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis. Histopathological analysis revealed marked inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and severe tissue damage and rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that T. brucei is exposed to a strong immune response in the male reproductive organs, similar to other tissues. The detection of a high number of parasites in this organ and its accessibility opens the possibility of using fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool in Animal African Trypanosomiasis.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the male reproductive system is an important site for accumulation of trypanosomes, but the testis has virtually no parasites. The majority of parasites are located in the stroma of the epididymis and in the surrounding epididymal adipose tissue, indicating that they are not protected by the tissue's specialized barriers. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis and may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease.

    Title: Modular Regulation of Chemosensory Genes in Drosophila melanogaster: A Systematic Analysis of Environmental and Physiological Plasticity

    Background: Chemosensation plays a critical role in the survival of most organisms, mediated by large families of chemoreceptor proteins whose expression must be finely tuned to changes in the chemical environment. We investigated the regulation of chemoreceptor genes in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism with well-characterized chemosensory systems.

    Research Question: Do chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation? Are certain chemoreceptor genes especially sensitive to environmental changes? Do groups of chemoreceptor genes undergo coordinated reexpression? How plastic is the expression of chemoreceptor genes with regard to sex, development, reproductive state, and social context?

    Methods: We used customized cDNA microarrays to analyze chemoreceptor gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster under various environmental and physiological conditions, including sex, development, reproductive state, and social interactions.

    Main Findings: Our results show that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Exposure to the odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes, which are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. We identified 20 relatively small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts, indicating a finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome.

    Implications: Our findings provide a systematic description of the plasticity of the chemosensory window through which Drosophila melanogaster experiences its chemical environment. The modular organization of the chemosensory transcriptome allows for finely tuned phenotypic plasticity of expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire under different environmental conditions.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that chemoreceptor gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster is highly plastic and responsive to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions. The finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome enables the fly to adapt to changing environments and social contexts, highlighting the importance of chemosensation in the survival and success of this species.

    **Title:** Investigating Abnormal Meiotic Recombination and Nondisjunction in Human Fetal Oocytes

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human trisomies, and can we identify vulnerable crossover configurations in human fetal oocytes using immunofluorescence methodology?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 1035 prophase oocytes from 31 fetal ovarian samples using immunofluorescence to examine the number and distribution of crossover-associated proteins (e.g., MLH1) on nondisjunction-prone human chromosomes. We also characterized genome-wide levels of recombination in the human female.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than predicted from genetic linkage analysis, but its localization pattern conforms to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. We observed evidence for vulnerable crossover configurations in individual chromosomes, consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that abnormal meiotic recombination, specifically failure to recombine or recombination events located too near to or too far from the centromere, are linked to the origin of human trisomies. The identification of vulnerable crossover configurations in human fetal oocytes using immunofluorescence methodology has the potential to predict and prevent nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for the presence of vulnerable crossover configurations in human fetal oocytes, which are consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human trisomies and may lead to the development of novel strategies for preventing nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the relationship between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human trisomies.

    **Title:** Modulating Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics through Immune Pre-Sensitisation: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How does pre-exposure to arthropod saliva influence the effects of vector control on vector-borne disease dynamics, and what are the implications for public health?

    **Methods:** We developed a general model of vector-borne disease to investigate the impact of immune pre-sensitisation on between-host infection dynamics and the consequences of interventions targeting vectors. Our model incorporates empirical evidence from Leishmania, Plasmodium, and arboviral infections, as well as experimental data from a rodent model of leishmaniasis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the abundance of pre-sensitised infected hosts increases when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates. However, if immune pre-sensitisation leads to more rapid clearance of infection, increasing vector mortality rates may achieve greater than expected disease control. Conversely, when immune pre-sensitisation prolongs the duration of infection, vector control can actually increase the total number of infected hosts. Sensitivity analysis suggests that these negative consequences can be mitigated through integrated vector management.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the need to quantify how immune pre-sensitisation modulates recovery and transmission rates in vector-borne diseases. The effect of saliva pre-exposure on acute symptoms is well-studied for leishmaniasis, but the immunological and clinical consequences are largely uncharted for other vector-parasite-host combinations. Our model predicts that the adverse consequence of vector control can be avoided if the probability of transmission to and from pre-sensitised hosts is considerably smaller than for naïve hosts.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that pre-exposure to vector saliva alters epidemiological outcomes in a manner that could be positive or negative to public health. Our results underscore the importance of considering immune pre-sensitisation in vector-borne disease modeling and highlight the need for further research to quantify its effects on clinical outcomes and parasite transmission. By integrating vector ecology, immunology, and epidemiology, our study provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between vectors, hosts, and parasites, ultimately informing the development of more effective vector control strategies.
Title: Modulation of Leishmania amazonensis Proteomes by Host Immune Response in BALB/c and BALB/c Nude Mice

    Abstract:
    Leishmaniasis is a significant disease affecting 12 million people worldwide, with 2 million new cases annually. Leishmania amazonensis is a major causative agent in Brazil, leading to various clinical forms, including localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The impact of host immune response on Leishmania phenotype and virulence remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of host immune system on Leishmania protein expression by comparing proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice.

    Methods:
    We employed two-dimensional electrophoresis with fluorescent labeling (DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/ToF) to analyze proteomes of mouse lesion-derived amastigotes from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice.

    Main Findings:
    Our results revealed 44 differentially expressed spots, including proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases. Notably, specific isoforms of oligopeptidase B and tryparedoxin peroxidase, known virulence factors, were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells may restrain their post-translational modifications in BALB/c mice. Conversely, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice.

    Implications:
    This study provides novel insights into the modulation of Leishmania amazonensis proteomes by host immune response. The identification of differentially expressed proteins, including virulence factors, may facilitate the understanding of Leishmania pathogenesis and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

    Conclusions:
    Our findings suggest that the host immune system plays a crucial role in modulating Leishmania protein expression, leading to changes in parasite virulence. The comparison of proteomes from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice highlights the importance of T-cell response in regulating Leishmania virulence factors. This study contributes to the understanding of Leishmaniasis immunopathology and may lead to the identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
Title: Cell Cycle Regulation of Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) Activity: Implications for Immunoglobulin Gene Diversification and Genomic Stability

    Abstract:
    Activation-induced deaminase (AID) is a crucial enzyme responsible for initiating immunoglobulin gene diversification through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in activated B cells. However, AID's high mutagenic potential can lead to genomic instability and chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Here, we investigate the cell cycle regulation of AID activity and its impact on SHM and CSR. Using high-content screening microscopy, we demonstrate that AID undergoes nuclear degradation more slowly in the G1 phase than in S or G2-M phases, and that mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance. By fusing AID to tags derived from cell cycle regulators, we show that enforced nuclear localization of AID in G1 phase accelerates SHM and CSR, while compromising viability in S-G2/M phase cells. We identify AID derivatives that accelerate SHM with minimal impact on viability, which can be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins through iterative mutagenesis and selection. Our findings suggest that cell cycle regulation of AID activity is a critical determinant of the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage, and that the use of cell cycle tags to regulate nuclear stability may be generally applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of cell cycle regulation in modulating AID activity and its impact on immunoglobulin gene diversification and genomic stability?

    Methods:
    We employed high-content screening microscopy to investigate the cell cycle regulation of AID activity and its impact on SHM and CSR. We fused AID to tags derived from cell cycle regulators CDT1 and Geminin to destroy nuclear protein outside G1 or S-G2/M phase. We also examined the effects of mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity on AID stability and abundance.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that AID undergoes nuclear degradation more slowly in G1 phase than in S or G2-M phases, and that mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance. Enforced nuclear localization of AID in G1 phase accelerates SHM and CSR, while compromising viability in S-G2/M phase cells. We identified AID derivatives that accelerate SHM with minimal impact on viability, which can be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that cell cycle regulation of AID activity is a critical determinant of the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage. The use of cell cycle tags to regulate nuclear stability may be generally applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the cell cycle regulation of AID activity and its impact on immunoglobulin gene diversification and genomic stability. The identification of AID derivatives that accelerate SHM with minimal impact on viability opens up new avenues for engineering genes and proteins through iterative mutagenesis and selection.

    **Title:** Systematic Analysis of Microbial Polysaccharide Catabolism Reveals Insights into Plant Biomass Degradation and Metabolism

    **Research Question:** How do microbes, specifically Clostridium phytofermentans, catabolize plant polysaccharides, and what enzymes are involved in this process?

    **Methods:** We developed a comprehensive approach integrating carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening to analyze how C. phytofermentans ferments plant biomass components, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that C. phytofermentans exhibits variable efficiencies in fermenting different polysaccharides, with diauxies prioritizing metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand-specific RNA-seq revealed that the bacterium up-regulates specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize constituent sugars. We purified 56 up-regulated CAZymes and demonstrated that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. Furthermore, we identified synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms.

    **Implications:** These findings advance our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is crucial for understanding the function of plant-degrading microbial communities and developing improved enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing of plant biomass.

    **Conclusions:** Our systematic analysis of microbial polysaccharide catabolism provides a framework for understanding the enzymatic machinery used by microbes to degrade and metabolize plant polysaccharides. This knowledge can be applied to improve industrial processes, such as cellulosic bioconversion, and has implications for understanding the function of plant-degrading microbial communities in the human gut microbiome.

    **Title:** Evaluation of the Impact of Integrated Annual Mass Drug Administration on Lymphatic Filariasis in Sierra Leone

    **Research Question:** Can integrated annual mass drug administration (MDA) effectively reduce lymphatic filariasis (LF) prevalence and intensity in endemic districts of Sierra Leone?

    **Methods:** A midterm assessment was conducted in 2011 to evaluate the impact of three integrated annual MDAs (2008-2010) on LF in 12 co-endemic districts of Sierra Leone. The study used the thick blood film method to determine microfilaria (mf) prevalence and intensity in the districts.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed a significant decrease in mf prevalence from 2.6% (95% CI: 2.3-3.0%) to 0.3% (95% CI: 0.19-0.47%), representing an 88.5% reduction (p=0.000). Four districts (Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono) achieved a 100% decrease in mf prevalence, while seven districts experienced reductions ranging from 70.0% to 95.0% (p=0.000, 0.060, 0.001, 0.014, 0.000, 0.000, and 0.002 for Bombali, Bonthe, Kailahun, Kambia, Koinadugu, Port Loko, and Tonkolili districts, respectively). Only Bombali district still had an mf prevalence ≥1.0% (1.58%, 95% CI: 0.80-3.09%).

    **Implications:** The study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrated annual MDA in reducing LF prevalence and intensity in endemic districts of Sierra Leone. The significant decrease in mf prevalence and intensity suggests that the program is on track to achieve LF elimination.

    **Conclusions:** The results of this study support the use of integrated annual MDA as a strategy for controlling and eliminating LF in Sierra Leone. The program's success can be attributed to the high geographic and program coverage, as well as the effectiveness of ivermectin in reducing LF in endemic communities. The findings of this study have important implications for LF control and elimination efforts in other regions with similar epidemiological profiles.

    **Title:** Mitigating Compositional Effects in High-Throughput Sequencing Data: A Novel Approach for Inferring Correlations in Microbial Communities

    **Background:** High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities in various ecosystems, including the human gut and oceans. However, analyzing compositional data generated by these techniques poses significant challenges, as the observed data represent relative fractions of genes or species rather than their absolute abundances.

    **Research Question:** To what extent do compositional artifacts affect the inference of correlations in real-world microbial communities, and can we develop a novel approach to mitigate these effects?

    **Methods:** We employed simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project to investigate the impact of compositional effects on correlation analysis. We applied standard statistical methods to 16S rRNA gene survey data, which measure the compositions of microbial communities found in different body sites of individuals. We also developed a new approach, called SparCC, to estimate correlation values from compositional data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, leading to artifactual correlations among taxa. We found that community diversity is a key factor modulating the acuteness of these effects. Using SparCC, we inferred a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering compositional effects when analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. We demonstrate that the standard approach yields spurious species-species interactions and misses true interactions, particularly in samples with low diversity. SparCC provides a novel solution to mitigate these effects, enabling more accurate inference of correlations in microbial communities.

    **Conclusions:** This study addresses a critical challenge in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and provides a new tool, SparCC, for estimating correlations from compositional data. Our findings have significant implications for the study of microbial communities in various ecosystems, including the human microbiome, and highlight the need for careful consideration of compositional effects in future research.

    **Title:** The Role of Lysozyme and Peptidoglycan Modifications in the Colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae on Mucosal Surfaces

    **Research Question:** What is the contribution of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications to the colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae on mucosal surfaces?

    **Methods:** Competition experiments were performed with wild-type and pgdAadr mutant pneumococci in lysozyme M-sufficient (LysM+/+) and -deficient (LysM−/−) mice to examine the role of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications during colonization of the upper respiratory tract.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the antimicrobial effect of human lysozyme is due to its muramidase activity, and that both peptidoglycan modifications by PgdA and Adr are required for full resistance by pneumococci. The wild-type strain out-competed the double mutant in LysM+/+ mice, but not in LysM−/− mice, indicating the importance of resistance to the muramidase activity of lysozyme during mucosal colonization. In contrast, strains containing single mutations in either pgdA or adr prevailed over the wild-type strain in both LysM+/+ and LysM−/− mice, suggesting that individual peptidoglycan modifications diminish fitness during colonization.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that the combination of peptidoglycan modifications reduces overall fitness, but that this is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to the peptidoglycan-degrading activity of lysozyme. This suggests that the expression of peptidoglycan-modifying enzymes may be differentially regulated under conditions where the requirement for lysozyme resistance may vary.

    **Conclusions:** The results of this study highlight the complex effects of peptidoglycan modification on bacterial growth and survival in different environments. The findings also suggest that mucosal lysozyme may have direct effects on colonization through its ability to lyse pneumococci that do not express PgdA and Adr. Overall, our study demonstrates the critical role of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications in dictating the composition of the microflora of the mucosal surface of the upper airway.

    **Title:** Evaluation of NS1 Capture Tests for Dengue Virus Detection in Tissue Specimens from Fatal Cases in Brazil

    **Research Question:** Can NS1 capture tests be used as an alternative tool for detecting dengue virus (DENV) in tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases?

    **Methods:** A retrospective study was conducted using tissue homogenates from 23 dengue fatal cases that occurred in Brazil in 2002. Three NS1 capture tests were evaluated: Dengue Early ELISA (PanBio Diagnostics), Platelia NS1 (BioRad Laboratories), and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip (BioRad Laboratories).

    **Main Findings:** The overall dengue fatal case diagnosis based on the tissues analyzed by Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the NS1 Ag Strip was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8% (14/23), and 91.3% (21/23), respectively. The highest sensitivity (78.3%; 58/74) was achieved by the NS1 Ag Strip. The NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive in liver (91.3%; 21/23), lung (71.4%; 10/14), kidney (100%; 4/4), brain (80%; 8/10), spleen (66.6%, 10/15), and thymus (100%, 3/3) when compared to the other two ELISA assays.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates that DENV NS1 capture assays are a valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a clinical/pathological diagnostic tool. The results suggest that the NS1 Ag Strip is the most sensitive test for detecting DENV in tissue specimens, particularly in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus tissues.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that NS1 capture tests can be used as an alternative tool for detecting DENV in tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases. The high sensitivity of the NS1 Ag Strip test makes it a valuable tool for postmortem dengue confirmation, particularly in cases where other diagnostic methods are not available. The findings of this study have important implications for the diagnosis and surveillance of dengue fever, which is a significant public health concern in Brazil and other parts of the world.

    Title: Elucidating Molecular Alterations in Multiple Myeloma: A Comparative Analysis of Self-Reported Race and Genetic Ancestry

    Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy with significantly higher incidence and mortality rates among African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasians (CA). Understanding the molecular underpinnings of this disparity is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.

    Research Question: What are the differences in molecular alterations in MM as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry?

    Methods: We analyzed somatic whole exome and RNA-sequencing data from 718 MM patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study Interim Analysis 9. Somatic mutational analyses were performed using the MUTSIG CV algorithm, and clinical data were correlated to identify significant driver mutations.

    Main Findings: Our study revealed significant differences in mutation frequency between AA and CA cases. Notably, BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 demonstrated higher mutation frequencies among AA cases, which are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, TP53 and IRF4 mutation frequencies were higher among CA cases. Furthermore, we observed a significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency among patients with higher European admixture in our dataset.

    Implications: These findings provide rationale for interrogating diverse tumor cohorts to understand tumor genomics across populations. The identification of BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 as new candidate myeloma genes may shed light on their potential role in myelomagenesis, particularly in patients of African descent.

    Conclusions: Our study represents one of the most comprehensive genomics studies of MM in patients of African descent, highlighting potential ancestry-related differences in biological mechanisms of myelomagenesis. These findings underscore the need for deeper understanding of oncogenic processes driving MM pathogenesis in statistically powered multi-ethnic cohorts to address disparities in incidence and outcomes observed among AA or otherwise African descent patients.

    **Title:** Inferring Cancer Evolution from Passenger Mutations: A Novel Approach to Understanding Tumorigenesis

    **Research Question:** Can passenger mutations in cancer cells provide insights into the evolutionary history of an individual cancer, and can they be used to infer the parameters of the tumorigenic process?

    **Methods:** We developed a mathematical model to describe the stochastic expansion of a population of cancer cells, focusing on the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions. We analyzed the fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations ordered by their time of appearance, and computed the likelihood of specific evolutionary trees to inform phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer evolution in individual patients.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the frequencies of the first and most abundant passenger mutations are influenced not only by the mutation rate, but also by the death-birth ratio (δ) of cancer cells. We found that if δ is close to 1, several clonal passengers may not have been present in the first tumor cell, but were collected during clonal expansion. Conversely, if δ = 0.99, there will be about 150 passenger mutations present in more than 1% of cancer cells. We also derived exact formulas for the expected numbers of subclonal mutations of any frequency, which can be fitted to cancer sequencing data to estimate the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells during early stages of clonal expansion.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding cancer evolution and tumorigenesis. Passenger mutations can serve as a molecular clock, providing information about the evolutionary history of an individual cancer. They can also become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. Furthermore, our model can be used to estimate the number of clonal mutations present in the first malignant cell by subtracting the number of subclonal mutations with frequency above 50% from the number of all clonal mutations in the cancer.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that passenger mutations can be used to infer the parameters of the tumorigenic process, including the death-birth ratio of cancer cells. This novel approach has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer evolution and tumorigenesis, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Flanking Regions in Huntingtin Protein Misfolding and Aggregation

    **Research Question:** How do the flanking regions surrounding the polyglutamine (polyQ) region of the huntingtin protein contribute to its misfolding and aggregation in Huntington's disease?

    **Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure and dynamics of monomeric huntingtin protein (XN1) with full flanking regions, a variant missing the polyproline regions, and an isolated polyQ peptide (Qn). We examined glutamine repeat lengths of 23, 36, 40, and 47 for each construct.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed a positive correlation between the probability of polyQ peptides to form a β-rich misfolded state and their expansion length. We also found that the flanking regions of XN1 affect its probability to form a β-rich state compared to the isolated polyQ. Notably, the polyproline regions form polyproline type II helices and decrease the probability of the polyQ region to form a β-rich state. Furthermore, lengthening polyQ leads to a higher likelihood of the first N-terminal 17 residues adopting a β-sheet conformation rather than an α-helix conformation.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a structural insight into XN1 misfolding and elucidates the possible role of the flanking sequences in XN1 aggregation. The findings suggest that the flanking regions, particularly the polyproline regions, play a crucial role in modulating the misfolding and aggregation of XN1. This knowledge can inform the development of strategies to inhibit XN1 aggregation and potentially treat Huntington's disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our molecular dynamics study sheds light on the complex interplay between the polyQ region and flanking regions in XN1 misfolding and aggregation. The results highlight the importance of considering the entire protein sequence, including flanking regions, in understanding the molecular mechanism of Huntington's disease. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the flanking regions to prevent XN1 aggregation and mitigate disease progression.

    Title: Systematic Exploration of CRISPR Loci in Human-Associated Microbial Communities Reveals Body-Site Specificity and Novel CRISPR Variants

    Background: The CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system is a primary defense strategy employed by eubacteria and archaea against foreign nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative plasmids. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has generated hundreds of shotgun metagenomic datasets, enabling us to explore the distribution and diversity of CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities.

    Research Question: Can a targeted assembly strategy improve the identification of CRISPR loci in metagenomic datasets, and what is the distribution and diversity of CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities?

    Methods: We developed a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRISPR arrays that whole-metagenome assemblies fail to identify. For each known CRISPR type, we used its direct repeat consensus sequence to recruit reads from each HMP dataset and assembled the recruited reads into CRISPR loci. We also identified novel CRISPRs or new CRISPR variants in contigs from whole-metagenome assemblies and used targeted assembly to more comprehensively identify these CRISPRs across samples.

    Main Findings: We identified 64 known and 86 novel CRISPRs, which are largely body-site specific. Known streptococcal CRISPRs were identified in most oral microbiomes, totaling ∼8,000 unique spacers. Samples resampled from the same individual and oral site shared the most spacers, while different oral sites from the same individual shared significantly fewer, and different individuals had almost no common spacers.

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci to the study of the dynamic ecology of microbiomes. The availability of CRISPR spacer sequences can be used to understand human and human microbiome biology better, utilizing the metadata associated with the HMP datasets.

    Conclusions: Our targeted assembly strategy greatly improved the detection of CRISPR elements from metagenomic datasets, identifying known CRISPRs in more human microbiome datasets compared to whole-metagenome assemblies. This study demonstrates the potential applications of CRISPRs to the tracing of rare species and the virus exposure of individuals, underscoring the significance of CRISPR loci in understanding the complex interactions between humans and their microbiomes.
Title: Identification of Circadian-Regulated Transcripts in Caenorhabditis elegans: Implications for Understanding the Evolution and Function of the Biological Clock

    Abstract:

    Background: The endogenous circadian clock is a fundamental biological process that regulates various physiological and behavioral rhythms in most organisms. However, the existence and characteristics of the circadian clock in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) remain unclear. While behavioral rhythms have been observed in C. elegans, no circadian transcriptional rhythms have been identified.

    Research Question: Do C. elegans exhibit circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms, and if so, how are they entrained by environmental signals such as light and temperature?

    Methods: We employed genome-wide expression profiling experiments to identify light- and temperature-entrained oscillating transcripts in C. elegans. We also analyzed the effects of mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction on circadian gene expression.

    Main Findings: Our results show that C. elegans exhibits circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms, with transcripts exhibiting rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods. Light and temperature cycles drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely non-overlapping gene sets. Mutations in the TAX-2 cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit abolish both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, suggesting that environmental cues act cell non-autonomously to entrain circadian rhythms.

    Implications: Our findings demonstrate that C. elegans has a bona fide circadian clock that is entrained by light and temperature. This discovery opens up new avenues for exploring the evolution and function of the biological clock in this model organism. The results also suggest that C. elegans may utilize a timekeeping mechanism distinct from that described in other animals.

    Conclusions: Our study provides the first identification of circadian-regulated transcripts in C. elegans and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the entrainment of the circadian clock by environmental signals. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and function of the biological clock and highlight the potential of C. elegans as a model organism for further research in this area.

    Title: Characterization of Recombinogenic DNA Lesions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 Mutants

    Background: The RAD3 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a homolog of the human XPD gene, which encodes a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutant alleles of RAD3 (rad3-101 and rad3-102) exhibit partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype.

    Research Question: What is the nature of the recombinogenic DNA lesions responsible for the hyper-Rec phenotype in rad3-101 and rad3-102 mutants?

    Methods: We used a system to recover reciprocal products of mitotic recombination to characterize the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3-101 and rad3-102 mutants. We mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications.

    Main Findings: We found that both rad3-101 and rad3-102 mutants elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events revealed that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect double sister-chromatid breaks (DSCBs), while the remainder reflect single chromatid breaks (SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. We also found a significant association between the location of recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX.

    Implications: Our results suggest that the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3-101 and rad3-102 mutants is due to elevated levels of recombinogenic DNA lesions. We propose that these lesions are either unrepaired single-stranded nicks converted into single chromatid breaks by DNA replication or DSBs or TFIIH-bound DNA lesions in unreplicated chromosomes converted into DSCBs by DNA replication.

    Conclusions: Our genome-wide analysis shows that rad3 mutations stimulate both crossovers and gene conversions by one to two orders of magnitude throughout the genome. The patterns of gene conversions associated with mitotic crossovers suggest that a subset of spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3 mutants and highlight the importance of NER in maintaining genome stability.

    **Title:** Slipped Strand Mispairing in Helicobacter pylori: A Rheostat-Like Mechanism for Transcriptional Regulation of SabA Expression

    **Research Question:** How does Helicobacter pylori regulate the expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin (SabA) to adapt to the ever-changing host environment during persistent infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of a T-tract, a simple sequence repeat (SSR) located intergenically to the sabA promoter, in regulating SabA expression in H. pylori. We generated T-tract variants in an isogenic strain background and analyzed their effects on sabA promoter activity, SabA protein expression, and binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the length of the T-tract generates multiphasic output from the sabA promoter, leading to alterations in SabA mRNA and protein levels. We found that the T-tract length affects the local DNA structure, shifting the axial alignment between the core promoter and UP-like elements, and thereby modulating the binding of RNA polymerase. We also identified additional genes in H. pylori with T- or A-tracts positioned similarly to sabA, and demonstrated that variations in the tract length act as rheostats to modulate cognate promoter output.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation in H. pylori, mediated by promoter-proximal SSRs, which provides an alternative to classical trans-acting regulatory factors. This mechanism allows H. pylori to fine-tune SabA expression in response to the host environment, enabling the bacterium to adapt to changing conditions during persistent infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that the T-tract length acts as a rheostat to regulate SabA expression in H. pylori, influencing the bacterium's ability to bind to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori pathogenesis and highlights the importance of SSRs in transcriptional regulation in bacteria. Our results have implications for understanding the host-pathogen interplay and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat H. pylori infections.
Title: Activation of STAT-5 by High-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Promotes Viral Replication through the ATM DNA Damage Response

    Abstract:
    Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade innate immune surveillance to establish persistent infections and amplify viral genomes upon cell differentiation. Members of the JAK-STAT family are crucial regulators of the innate immune response, and HPV proteins have been shown to downregulate expression of STAT-1 to facilitate stable maintenance of viral episomes.

    Research Question: Do HPV proteins activate STAT-5, a member of the JAK-STAT family, to promote viral replication and genome amplification in differentiating keratinocytes?

    Methods: We investigated the role of STAT-5 in the HPV life cycle using primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) persistently infected with retroviruses expressing HPV31 E6 or E7. We analyzed the levels of STAT-5α, STAT-5β, STAT-5, and phospho-STAT-5 by Western blot analysis and assessed the effects of pimozide, an inhibitor of STAT-5 activation, on differentiation-dependent HPV31 genome amplification and late gene expression.

    Main Findings: Our studies show that HPV E7 activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. In contrast, treatment of undifferentiated cells that stably maintain episomes has no effect on viral replication. Knockdown studies reveal that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity, which is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. A downstream target of STAT-5, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway.

    Implications: These findings identify an important new regulatory mechanism by which the innate immune regulator, STAT-5, promotes HPV viral replication through activation of the ATM DNA damage response. Suppression of PPARγ by HX531 negatively interferes with DNA damage signaling in HPV-positive keratinocytes.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that HPV proteins activate STAT-5 to induce productive replication in differentiated cells and that STAT-5 regulates genome amplification through activation of the ATM DNA damage response. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HPV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting STAT-5 and the ATM pathway.

    Title: Identification of Novel Biomarkers for Asymptomatic Salmonella Typhi Carriage using In Vivo-Induced Antigen Technology (IVIAT)

    Background: Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) can colonize and persist in the biliary tract of infected individuals, resulting in a state of asymptomatic chronic carriage. Chronic carriers may act as persistent reservoirs of infection within a community and introduce infection to susceptible individuals and new communities. However, little is known about the interaction between the host and pathogen in the biliary tract of chronic carriers, and there is currently no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriage.

    Methods: To study host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract during S. Typhi carriage, we applied in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to identify potential biomarkers unique to carriers. IVIAT identifies humorally immunogenic bacterial antigens expressed uniquely in the in vivo environment. We hypothesized that S. Typhi surviving in the biliary tract of humans may express a distinct antigenic profile.

    Main Findings: Thirteen S. Typhi antigens that were immunoreactive in carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area, were identified. The identified antigens included a number of putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. YncE (STY1479), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in our screen. The response to YncE in patients whose biliary tract contained S. Typhi was compared to responses in patients whose biliary tract did not contain S. Typhi, patients with acute typhoid fever, and healthy controls residing in a typhoid endemic area. Seven of 10 (70%) chronic carriers, 0 of 8 bile culture-negative controls (0%), 0 of 8 healthy Bangladeshis (0%), and 1 of 8 (12.5%) Bangladeshis with acute typhoid fever had detectable anti-YncE IgG in blood. IgA responses were also present.

    Implications: Further evaluation of YncE and other antigens identified by IVIAT could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers. Understanding the mechanisms involved in development and persistence of the carrier state may facilitate development of improved diagnostic assays and therapeutic approaches for S. Typhi carriage.

    Title: Trans-reactivation: A Novel Epigenetic Mechanism of Gene Expression Control Mediated by Homologous RNA Molecules in Heterochromatic Genes

    Research Question: Can non-functional alleles of a silenced gene reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene in the presence of heterochromatin?

    Methods: We investigated the role of cellular RNA pools produced by homologous genomic loci in defining the transcriptional state of a silenced gene by testing the effect of non-functional alleles of the white gene in the presence of a functional copy of white, silenced by heterochromatin.

    Main Findings: We discovered a novel epigenetic phenomenon, termed trans-reactivation, where non-functional alleles of white, unable to produce a coding transcript, can reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. This phenomenon is heritable, relies on the presence of homologous RNA molecules, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that trans-reactivation is a new level of gene expression control mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes. This mechanism is distinct from previously characterized epigenetic reprogramming events, such as paramutation, transinduction, and transvection. The presence of non-functional white alleles causes an increase in the expression of the wm4h gene transcript and an opening in the chromatin structure at the wm4h locus.

    Conclusions: Our data indicate that trans-reactivation is a novel epigenetic mechanism that positively controls gene expression in the context of heterochromatin. The presence of homologous RNA molecules plays a crucial role in this process, and mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing affect trans-reactivation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of gene expression control and epigenetic regulation, particularly in the context of heterochromatic genes. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying trans-reactivation and its potential applications in understanding and manipulating gene expression in various biological systems.

    **Title:** Boophilin, a multifunctional inhibitor from the midgut of hematophagous mosquitoes and ticks, targets proteolytic reactions of the coagulation and complement cascades.

    **Research Question:** How does Boophilin, a 2-Kunitz multifunctional inhibitor from the midgut of hematophagous mosquitoes and ticks, interact with thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein, and does it inhibit thrombosis in vivo?

    **Methods:** Boophilin was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity. Amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments were used to determine the kinetics of Boophilin interaction with thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein.

    **Main Findings:** Boophilin behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates, with a Ki of ~100 nM. It also inhibits FXIa, preventing FIX activation, and kallikrein activity, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). In vivo, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method.

    **Implications:** Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, allowing hematophagous mosquitoes and ticks to successfully digest a blood meal, which is critical for metabolism and egg development.

    **Conclusions:** This study elucidates several unknown aspects of Boophilin, including its kinetics, effects on platelets, and in vivo anti-thrombotic activity. Boophilin is the first tick midgut FXIa anticoagulant also found to inhibit thrombosis. The results emphasize the importance of Boophilin in several aspects associated with tick feeding and metabolism, and highlight its potential as a target for the development of novel anticoagulant therapies.

    **Title:** Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT): A Computational Framework for Understanding the Role of Inflammation in Enteric Mucosal Tissue Patterning

    **Research Question:** How does inflammation influence the enteric mucosal tissue architecture, and what are the underlying cellular and molecular dynamics that determine the epithelial crypt-villus architecture across a range of conditions from health to disease?

    **Methods:** We developed the Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT), an agent-based computational model that simulates the cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture. SEGMEnT integrates multiple functional modules, including an intra-cellular morphogenic signaling pathway, an intra-cellular inflammatory signaling pathway, cell state transitions for proliferation, differentiation, and movement, and spatial diffusion of morphogens to define gut epithelial cell behavior.

    **Main Findings:** SEGMEnT reproduces healthy ileal mucosal dynamics and a series of morphogen knock-out/inhibition experiments, providing insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as the putative role of Phosphotase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PTEN/PI3K) as a key point of crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion, and chronic low-level inflammation as a driver for colonic metaplasia.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease, providing a framework for understanding the complex interplay of multiple functional objectives that maintain the enteric mucosal architecture in a state of health, but can become disturbed to generate pathological conditions.

    **Conclusions:** SEGMEnT offers a novel approach to understanding the role of inflammation in enteric mucosal tissue patterning, providing a dynamic representation of the underlying cellular and molecular dynamics that determine the epithelial crypt-villus architecture across a range of conditions from health to disease. By integrating multiple functional modules and simulating the behavior of gut epithelial cells, SEGMEnT has the potential to unify a broad spectrum of intestinal diseases and provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in maintaining the enteric mucosal architecture and its response to inflammation.

    **Title:** Overcoming Pyrethroid Resistance in Aedes aegypti for Effective Wolbachia Deployment

    **Research Question:** Can Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes successfully invade a local population with high levels of pyrethroid resistance?

    **Methods:** Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the wMelBr strain of Wolbachia were released in the community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for 20 consecutive weeks. The frequency of Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes was monitored, and the effects of doubling releases and deploying mosquitoes with large wing length and low laboratory mortality were investigated.

    **Main Findings:** Despite receiving >87% approval from householders, the wMelBr frequency plateaued at ~40% during weeks 7-19 and peaked at 65% but dropped as releases stopped. A high maternal transmission rate of 97.56% was observed. However, the presence of pyrethroid-resistant genotypes in the wMelBr strain decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations, indicating that the initial release of susceptible mosquitoes in a population highly resistant to pyrethroids jeopardized Wolbachia invasion.

    **Implications:** The study highlights the importance of matching the local population genetics, particularly insecticide resistance background, to achieve Wolbachia invasion. The wMelRio strain, produced by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce pyrethroid resistance alleles, successfully established in the population where wMelBr failed.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that Wolbachia deployment should match the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to achieve invasion. Given the widespread distribution of pyrethroid-resistant alleles in natural Ae. aegypti populations, future Wolbachia deployments must prioritize maintaining insecticide resistance in lab colonies for releases. The findings of this study have significant implications for the use of Wolbachia as a disease transmission control strategy, particularly in regions with high levels of pyrethroid resistance.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complex Signaling Pathways of Poxviruses: A Novel Epistatic Relationship between B1 Kinase and B12 Pseudokinase

    **Research Question:** How do poxviruses modulate cellular defense mechanisms and ensure proper viral factor regulation, and what is the role of the B1 kinase and B12 pseudokinase in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to perform an unbiased search for suppressor mutations and identify novel pathways involving B1. After several passages of the ΔB1 virus, we observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. We then characterized the adapted viruses and found that mutations correlating with a loss of function of the vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provided a striking fitness enhancement to the virus.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that expression of full-length B12 leads to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but has no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. We also found that B12 primarily localizes to the nucleus, a characteristic rarely found among poxviral proteins. Furthermore, BAF phosphorylation is reduced under conditions in which B12 is present in infected cells without B1, indicating that B12 may function in part by enhancing antiviral activity of BAF.

    **Implications:** Our studies of B1 and B12 present novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, perhaps serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and to orchestrate yet-to-be-discovered nuclear events during infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study of the vaccinia B1 kinase has yielded numerous unexpected insights into poxvirus adaptation pathways and signal transduction circuitry. Our results suggest that B1 contributes to viral fitness via antagonism of BAF and B12 proteins, and raise new questions regarding the underlying mechanism of action for this pseudokinase and how it is governed by B1. Future investigation of the inhibitory action of B12 and its potential role in other poxviruses and pathogens will be of broad biological interest, particularly given the prevalence of pseudokinase domains in diverse eukaryotic organisms.

    **Title:** Investigating the Conformational Behavior of Synthetic Peptides in Response to Environmental Interfaces

    **Research Question:** How do synthetic peptides with built-in secondary amphiphilicity respond to macroscopic and molecular interfaces, and what are the implications for their conformational behavior?

    **Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, with built-in secondary amphiphilicity upon forming an alpha-helix. We systematically studied their aggregation and the influence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces on their conformational preferences.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the peptides are neither random coils in bulk water nor fully formed alpha helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. These conformations provide a basis for conformation-selection and population-shift upon environmental changes. We found that the peptides' aggregation behavior is strongly affected by the presence or absence of an interface, and subtly depends on their surface charge and hydrophobicity.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered peptides is highly susceptible to environmental conditions, such as pH, salts, or presence of interfaces. The peptides' response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces can be linked to their inherent alpha-helical tendencies in bulk water. These results have implications for understanding the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides in various biological systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that synthetic peptides with built-in secondary amphiphilicity can adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements in response to environmental interfaces. These findings provide new insights into the conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered peptides and highlight the importance of considering the effects of interfaces on protein structure and function. Further research is needed to explore the implications of these findings for understanding protein folding, aggregation, and function in various biological contexts.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Telomeric Repeats in Human Herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) Integration and Latency

    Abstract:

    Background: Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are ubiquitous betaherpesviruses that infect humans within the first years of life and establish latency in various cell types. The molecular mechanism of viral integration into host chromosomes remains elusive.

    Research Question: What is the role of telomeric repeats (TMR) in HHV-6A integration and latency?

    Methods: We generated recombinant viruses that lack all TMR or only harbor either perfect TMR (pTMR) or imperfect TMR (impTMR). We established an in vitro integration system to assess integration efficiency and genome maintenance in latently infected cells.

    Main Findings: Our data show that TMR are dispensable for HHV-6A replication, but crucial for integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. Individual deletion of pTMR and impTMR revealed that pTMR play the major role in HHV-6A integration, while impTMR only make a minor contribution.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that TMR facilitate integration into host telomeres, depicting a novel mechanism for the maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. Integration does not only occur upon infection in vitro, but also plays an important role in vivo.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first experimental evidence that TMR are involved in HHV-6A integration and latency. Our results establish a model for HHV-6A integration and highlight the importance of TMR in the maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of HHV-6A latency and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into Poxvirus Morphogenesis: Unveiling the Role of D13 in Viral Assembly

    **Research Question:** How do poxviruses assemble their infectious particles, and what is the role of the D13 protein in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the vaccinia virus protein D13, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. We also used electron microscopy to analyze the membrane remodeling capacities of D13 in 2-D crystals and reconstituted immature-virion-like particles.

    **Main Findings:** The crystal structure of D13 reveals a double-barrel organization consisting of two jellyrolls (J1 and J2) decorated by a β-sandwich forming the head domain. D13 assembles into trimers that are homologous to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. When tethered onto artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice and assembly products structurally similar to the viral crescents and immature particles.

    **Implications:** Our findings establish that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. The D13 protein is a driving force in this process, as it has the intrinsic ability to form immature-virion-like particles in the absence of any other viral factors. Neutralization of D13 either by point mutation or rifampicin completely inhibits viral assembly.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides structural insights into the morphogenesis of poxviruses and reveals the role of D13 in this process. The findings have significant implications for the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors, as D13 is the target of rifampicin. Furthermore, the structural similarities between poxviruses and giant mimivirus suggest that these viruses may share homologous molecular mechanisms for assembling their large capsids. Future studies will aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing poxvirus morphogenesis and explore the potential of D13 as a target for antiviral therapy.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complex Interplay between Auxin and Ethylene Signaling in Brachypodium Root Development

    **Research Question:** How do auxin and ethylene signaling pathways interact to regulate root development in the monocotyledon Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium)?

    **Methods:** We isolated and characterized a Brachypodium mutant in the TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene, which encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase involved in auxin biosynthesis. We analyzed the root phenotypes of this mutant and compared them to those of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) taa1/tar mutants.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to expectations, the Brachypodium Bdtar2l mutant displayed dramatically elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation, despite reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity. This phenotype was also observed in another, stronger Bdtar2l allele and could be mimicked by treating wild-type plants with L-kynerunine, a specific TAA1/TAR inhibitor. Surprisingly, L-kynerunine-treated and Bdtar2l roots displayed elevated rather than reduced auxin levels, which did not result from compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Instead, expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) to auxin, was increased in Bdtar2l mutants.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots. We propose that ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation. This contrasts with the gradually reduced root growth and auxin levels described for Arabidopsis taa1/tar mutants.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk in Brachypodium compared to Arabidopsis. We propose that auxin levels might normally be supra-optimal for cell elongation in Brachypodium, and that reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity results in increased root cell elongation and anisotropy. These results have important implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between auxin and ethylene signaling pathways in plant root development.

    **Title:** Promoter Organization Constrains Early Evolutionary Dynamics and Biases Long-Term Evolution in Budding Yeast

    **Research Question:** How do differences in promoter nucleosome organization influence the rate of gene evolution in budding yeast?

    **Methods:** We artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins in budding yeast and examined the genomic response to this selection. We chose 41 yeast proteins that span a range of mid-to-high expression levels, with no preferences towards specific functions or positions along the chromosome. Genes were distributed between the DPN (Depleted Proximal Nucleosomes) and OPN (Occupied Proximal Nucleosomes) classes, as quantified by the relative nucleosome occupancy of their proximal promoter.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that selection was equally successful for OPN and DPN genes, with ~80% of genes in each group stably increasing in expression by a similar amount. However, the two groups adapted by distinct mechanisms: DPN-selected strains duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN-selected strains favored trans mutations not involving duplications. Notably, when selection was removed, DPN (but not OPN) genes reverted rapidly to wild-type expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that promoter organization constrains the early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution. Specifically, the presence or absence of a nucleosome-free region (NFR) proximal to the transcription start site (TSS) influences the rate of gene evolution. Genes lacking an NFR (OPN genes) vary widely between species, while those with a pronounced NFR (DPN genes) remain largely conserved.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into the relationship between promoter organization and gene evolution. The flexible promoter structure of OPN genes may allow them to respond more easily to selection forces, while the more rigid structure of DPN genes may limit their ability to adapt to changing environments. These findings have important implications for our understanding of evolutionary dynamics and the role of promoter organization in shaping the evolution of gene expression.

    **Title:** Tax-Induced Cellular Senescence as a Checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB Hyper-Activation in HTLV-1 Infection

    **Background:** The human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) trans-activator/oncoprotein, Tax, is thought to promote cell proliferation and transformation by activating I-κB kinases (IKKs) and NF-κB. However, paradoxically, Tax expression leads to the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, resulting in p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence as a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation in HTLV-1 infection?

    **Methods:** We used HeLa cells and small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown to investigate the role of RelA and RelB in p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence. We also examined the effect of the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, on Tax-induced senescence.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. We show that RelA induces this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27KIP1 protein and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection. Robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression drive IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and trigger senescence. HBZ, however, modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-κB activation, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation in HTLV-1 infection. Inactivation of this senescence checkpoint can facilitate persistent NF-κB activation and leukemogenesis. Our findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 and the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat HTLV-1-related diseases.

    **Title:** A Computational Model of Human Executive Function: Integrating Reasoning, Learning, and Creativity in Decision-Making

    **Research Question:** How does the human frontal lobe function control the creation, learning, storage, retrieval, and selection of behavioral strategies driving action in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments?

    **Methods:** Behavioral experiments were conducted to test a proposed computational model of human executive function, which integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior.

    **Main Findings:** The results show that the proposed model predicts human decisions and their variations across individuals in naturalistic situations. The model reveals that the human frontal function monitors up to three/four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers online their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than others, it is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed, partly from those stored in long-term memory, then probed, and if competitive, confirmed to subsequently drive action.

    **Implications:** The findings support a model of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior. The model suggests how the frontal lobes create and manage an expanding repertoire of flexible behavioral strategies for driving action in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments. This faculty engages the frontal lobe function that manages task sets – active representations of behavioral strategies stored in long-term memory – for driving action.

    **Conclusions:** The proposed computational model of human executive function clarifies the issue of how the human executive function controls online the creation of new behavioral strategies and manages an expanding collection of behavioral strategies for driving action. The results support a model of frontal lobe function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of executive control and decision-making. This model has significant implications for understanding human decision-making in everyday environments and has the potential to inform the development of artificial intelligence systems that can adapt to uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations.

    **Title:** Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT): A Novel Modeling Approach to Investigate Long-Term Effects of Pharmacological Interventions

    **Research Question:** Can a novel modeling approach, called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT), be used to predict the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions and identify potential side effects in complex biological systems?

    **Methods:** ADAPT is a mathematical modeling approach that employs time-dependent descriptions of model parameters to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations in response to pharmacological interventions. This approach integrates experimental data obtained during different stages of an intervention to provide an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression.

    **Main Findings:** We applied ADAPT to investigate the metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), a potential drug target to treat or prevent atherosclerosis. Our computational analysis revealed a counter-intuitive insight concerning the function of scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Although activation of LXR promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, our analysis showed that the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of SR-B1 in hepatic membranes.

    **Implications:** ADAPT can be used to identify potential unwanted side effects of pharmacological interventions and to design new target interventions to prevent these side effects. This approach provides a valuable tool for medical systems biology to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive disease progression and to translate this knowledge into therapies to effectively treat diseases.

    **Conclusions:** ADAPT is a novel modeling approach that can be used to investigate the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions and identify potential side effects in complex biological systems. Our study demonstrates the utility of ADAPT in predicting metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological activation of LXR and highlights the importance of considering time-dependent changes in model parameters to understand the dynamics of molecular adaptations.
Title: Recombination of Sensory and Motor Signals in the Spinocerebellar Pathways: A Novel Hypothesis for Coordination of Multi-Segmented Limbs and Bodies

Abstract:
The integration of sensory and motor signals in the neurons of origin of the spinocerebellar pathways has long been observed, but the functional significance of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. In this study, we propose a novel hypothesis for how the spinocerebellar systems and the cerebellar cortex interact to support coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. Our central idea is that the recombination of sensory and motor signals in the spinocerebellar neurons can be used to approximate a wide array of functions, including spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments. We argue that random recombination of sensory and motor signals is not a viable strategy due to the limited number of granule cells in the cerebellum, which severely restricts the number of recombinations that can be represented. Instead, we propose that the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations, which can be described as linear projections through aspects of the multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The granule cells, potentially aided by differentiated thresholding from Golgi cells, enhance the utility of these projections by allowing the Purkinje cell to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. Our hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be crucially supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems.

Methods:
We synthesized a number of findings into a new hypothesis for how the spinocerebellar systems and the cerebellar cortex interact to support coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. We considered the simplified example of controlling a planar double joint arm to illustrate how the coordination of a multi-segmented limb could work in principle.

Main Findings:
Our hypothesis proposes that the spinal circuitry makes a number of sensorimotor functions available to the cerebellar cortex through its MF projections via the SCT/SRCT systems. We argue that the granule cells, potentially aided by differentiated thresholding from Golgi cells, enhance the utility of these projections by allowing the Purkinje cell to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions.

Implications:
Our hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be crucially supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems.

Conclusions:
The integration of sensory and motor signals in the neurons of origin of the spinocerebellar pathways is a critical aspect of cerebellar function, and our hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how this integration supports the coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. Our findings suggest that the spinal circuitry plays a crucial role in providing useful recombinations of sensory and motor signals to the cerebellar cortex, which are then enhanced by the granule cells to support piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions.

    **Title:** Identification of Host MicroRNAs Regulated by Chikungunya Virus Infection in Aedes albopictus

    **Research Question:** What are the host microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) infection in Aedes albopictus, a major vector of the virus?

    **Methods:** We conducted a deep sequencing analysis of small RNA populations in Aedes albopictus Singh's cell line upon CHIKV infection using the Illumina platform. We identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV-infected cell lines, respectively. Additionally, we discovered nine novel miRNAs in Aedes albopictus. Comparative analysis revealed differential expression of 77 common miRNAs between the two libraries.

    **Main Findings:** CHIKV infection specifically altered the miRNA profile of a specific set of eight miRNAs. We identified putative targets of these regulated miRNAs and classified them into their pathways. Notably, four significantly over-expressed miRNAs (miR-100, miR-283, miR-305-3p, and miR-927) and four under-expressed miRNAs (miR-1000, miR-2b, miR-2c-3p, and miR-190-5p) were analyzed for their putative targets.

    **Implications:** Our study provides insights into the cellular modification by miRNAs during CHIKV infection in Aedes albopictus. The identification of regulated miRNAs and their putative targets offers leads for developing vector-based antiviral strategies. Furthermore, the comparison of Aedes albopictus miRNAs with Anopheles stephensi miRNAs regulated upon Plasmodium infection reveals interesting information on microRNAs of these two important vectors upon pathogen infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the impact of CHIKV infection on the miRNA profile of Aedes albopictus, a major vector of the virus. The identification of regulated miRNAs and their putative targets provides a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIKV infection in Aedes albopictus. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel antiviral strategies targeting the vector, ultimately contributing to the control and prevention of CHIKV transmission.
Title: Estimating the Economic Burden of Cystic Echinococcosis in Iran: A Monte Carlo Simulation Approach

    Abstract:
    Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a significant zoonotic disease affecting humans and livestock worldwide, with a substantial economic impact in many developing countries, including Iran. This study aimed to determine the monetary burden of CE in Iran using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Epidemiological data on CE prevalence and incidence in humans and animals were obtained from regional hospitals, scientific literature, and official government reports. Economic data on human and animal disease costs, including treatment, productivity losses, and livestock production losses, were obtained from official national and international datasets.

    Our results indicate that the mean number of surgical CE cases per year for 2000-2009 was estimated at 1,295. The number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country was estimated at 635,232 (95% Credible Interval, CI 149,466-1,120,998). The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at US$232.3 million (95% CI US$103.1-397.8 million), including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at US$93.39 million (95% CI US$6.1-222.7 million), and the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at US$132 million (95% CI US$61.8-246.5 million). The cost per surgical human case was estimated at US$1,539.

    Our findings suggest that CE has a considerable economic impact on Iran, with the cost of the disease approximated at 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. The results of this study highlight the need for the establishment of a CE surveillance system and the implementation of a control program to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country. A cost-benefit analysis of different control programs is recommended, incorporating present knowledge of the economic losses due to CE in Iran.

    This study provides the first comprehensive estimate of the economic burden of CE in Iran, highlighting the importance of accurate assessment of the disease burden to raise awareness among decision-makers and prioritize the use of limited resources for timely preventive measures. Future research should focus on evaluating the non-monetary burden of the disease and measuring the cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted by control campaigns.

    **Title:** Comprehensive Analysis of Mouse Polyomavirus (MPyV) Infection Reveals Dynamic Changes in Viral and Host Transcriptomes

    **Research Question:** How does Mouse Polyomavirus (MPyV) infection modulate viral and host gene expression during its life cycle, and what are the implications for host cell growth and metabolism?

    **Methods:** We employed deep sequencing to analyze the viral and host transcriptomes of mouse NIH3T6 cells infected with MPyV at various times after infection. Cells were serum-starved and infected with MPyV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 plaque-forming units per cell. Viral titer was determined by plaque assay.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a dynamic switch in viral gene expression from early-to-late times in infection, with both early-strand and late-strand RNAs being transcribed at all time points. Notably, we observed widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts at late times in infection. Furthermore, we identified significant changes in host gene expression, with 359 genes upregulated and 857 genes downregulated by 36 hours after infection. Gene ontology analysis indicated that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while transcripts involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger binding, SH3 domain, and GTPase activation were downregulated.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell growth and metabolism. The upregulation of long noncoding RNAs, including MALAT1, which is involved in splicing speckles and used as a marker in many late-stage cancers, suggests a potential role for MPyV in modulating host gene expression and contributing to oncogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our comprehensive analysis of MPyV infection reveals a complex interplay between viral and host gene expression, with significant changes in both viral and host transcriptomes. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell growth and metabolism, and highlight the potential for MPyV to contribute to oncogenesis.

    **Title:** Personalized Energetic Constraints on Endurance Running: A Computational Study

    **Research Question:** What are the physiologic variables that determine the energetic constraints on endurance runners, and how can they be used to predict the distance at which runners will exhaust their glycogen stores during a marathon?

    **Methods:** A computational model was developed to estimate the distance at which runners will exhaust their glycogen stores as a function of running intensity, muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed. The model incorporates the metabolic cost of running and the known dependence of fat versus carbohydrate metabolism on relative exertion.

    **Main Findings:** The results show that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle than previously thought, and depend on several physiologic variables, including muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed. The model predicts that carbohydrate loading prior to marathon running influences performance by permitting runners to run at greater speeds without exhausting glycogen reserves. Typical levels of glycogen loading permit runners with a given aerobic capacity and leg muscle distribution to complete a marathon safely in between four and five hours. The model also reveals the functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion, as well as the fastest pace at which a given distance, such as the marathon, can be run without exhausting glycogen stores.

    **Implications:** The present analysis provides a basis for guidelines ensuring the safety and optimizing the performance of endurance runners, both by setting personally appropriate paces and by prescribing midrace fueling requirements for avoiding ‘the wall’. The model also sheds physiologically principled light on important standards in marathon running that until now have remained empirically defined, such as the qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.

    **Conclusions:** The present study demonstrates that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle than previously thought, and depend on several physiologic variables that can be quantified and predicted. By taking into account these variables, runners can optimize their performance and avoid the phenomenon of ‘hitting the wall’ during a marathon.

    **Title:** Strain-Specific Interactions between Toxoplasma gondii and Host Cells Revealed by Global Transcriptome Analysis

    **Research Question:** Do non-canonical Toxoplasma gondii strains exhibit unique interactions with host cells, and if so, what are the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions?

    **Methods:** We infected murine macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains, representing global diversity, and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes.

    **Main Findings:** We identified large differences between strains in the expression level of known parasite effectors and large chromosomal structural variation in some strains. We also identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. Furthermore, we found that IFNβ production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) in fibroblasts.

    **Implications:** Our study provides global insight into host cells and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with both canonical and exotic Toxoplasma strains, and allows identification of novel strain-specific host cell responses and parasite effectors. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular basis for differences in pathogenesis between Toxoplasma strains, and suggest that specific Toxoplasma strains may have adapted to certain hosts.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that non-canonical Toxoplasma strains exhibit unique interactions with host cells, and that these interactions are mediated by strain-specifically regulated host pathways. These findings highlight the importance of considering the genotype of the parasite strain in understanding the outcome of toxoplasmosis in patients, and suggest that specific Toxoplasma strains may be more virulent or pathogenic in certain hosts. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these strain-specific interactions and their implications for human disease.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Heterologous Recombination in Enteroviruses: A Novel Reverse Genetic Approach Reveals a Biphasic Process

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism of heterologous recombination in enteroviruses, and how does it contribute to genotype diversity and the emergence of novel neuropathogenic variants?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel reverse genetic approach to investigate heterologous recombination in enteroviruses. We isolated intermediate chimeric intertypic polioviruses bearing genomes with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses yielded progeny with increased fitness, which had lost the duplicated sequences.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that heterologous recombination in enteroviruses is a biphasic process, consisting of an initial recombination event followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness. We found that mutations or inhibitors that altered polymerase fidelity or the coalescence of replication complexes significantly affected the yield of recombinants, suggesting that the process is replicative. Furthermore, we observed that extant recombinants result from a biphasic process, where an initial recombination event is followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of ‘evolution by duplication’ in positive-strand RNA viruses. The biphasic nature of heterologous recombination in enteroviruses suggests that it may be possible to enhance or reduce recombination-mediated viral evolution if required.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanism of heterologous recombination in enteroviruses, shedding light on the evolutionary processes that contribute to genotype diversity and the emergence of novel neuropathogenic variants. The biphasic nature of this process has important implications for our understanding of viral evolution and may have implications for the development of novel antiviral strategies.

    **Title:** Organic Cation Transporter 3 (Oct3) Regulates Norepinephrine Clearance and Browning of White Adipose Tissue

    **Research Question:** What is the role of organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) in the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue (WAT) and its impact on thermogenesis and lipolysis?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of Oct3 in NE clearance in WAT. We performed [3H]-NE uptake assays in primary white and brown adipocytes, as well as in vivo NE uptake assays after chemical sympathectomy. We also generated adipose-specific Oct3 knockout (KO) mice to study the effects of Oct3 ablation on thermogenesis and lipolysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Oct3 is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes. We found that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Ablation of Oct3 induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared to littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT in adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice shows stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Oct3 governs β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolishes the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient ingWAT, indicating the NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes in Oct3 KO adipocytes. Reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 are also associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR).

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that Oct3 is essential for NE clearance in adipocytes of WAT and blunts intracellular responses upon sustained catecholamine stimulation by regulating the activity of β-AR. Development of OCT3-specific inhibitors may shed light on improving metabolic disorders.

    **Title:** Chromoshadow-Domain of HP1 Proteins Interacts with Histone H3 at the Nucleosome Entry/Exit Point to Regulate Chromatin Remodeling

    **Background:** Heterochromatin-enriched HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating transcription by binding to histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9 (H3K9). However, their affinity for native methylated chromatin is relatively poor, and chromatin opening during DNA replication facilitates their binding.

    **Research Question:** Do HP1 proteins have additional histone binding activities that enable them to interact with chromatin regions occluded by the nucleosome structure?

    **Methods:** We used in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the interaction between HP1 proteins and histone H3 at the nucleosome entry/exit point.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that the chromoshadow-domain (CSD) of HP1 proteins interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome, a region also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex. This interaction is essential for efficient SWI/SNF remodeling, which is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. We also observed that SWI/SNF activity favors the loading of HP1 proteins onto chromatin both in vivo and in vitro.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling. We propose a model in which HP1 proteins function as sensors of SWI/SNF activity, binding to nucleosome domains uncovered by remodeling and blocking the reaction.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which HP1 proteins regulate chromatin remodeling by interacting with histone H3 at the nucleosome entry/exit point. These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between HP1 proteins, SWI/SNF complex, and chromatin remodeling, and highlight the importance of chromatin opening in facilitating HP1 binding to chromatin.

    **Title:** Self-Containment in RNA Secondary Structure: A Novel Property of Functional RNAs

    **Research Question:** Do particular functional RNA substructures exhibit a tendency to robustly adopt the same optimal secondary structure regardless of their surrounding nucleotide context?

    **Methods:** We developed a scoring method, the self-containment index, to measure the degree of self-containment in RNA sequences. We applied this method to various functional RNA classes, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and found that miRNA stem loops exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a trend toward higher self-containment among clustered and conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self-containment may be a characteristic of novel miRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. We found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, but also observed a trend toward natural selection for self-containment in most functional RNA classes.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that self-containment arises out of selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function. We propose that self-containment is an evolved feature of particular RNA classes, rather than a characteristic purely determined by the physicochemical characteristics of folded RNA.

    **Conclusions:** The self-containment index provides a valuable tool for annotating and designing functional RNAs. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution and function of miRNAs and other functional RNAs, and highlight the importance of self-containment as a property of RNA secondary structure. The Python implementation and Web interface for calculating the self-containment index are available at http://kim.bio.upenn.edu/software/.

    **Title:** Identification of Novel Transcription Factors and Secreted Signaling Peptides that Contribute to Plant Disease Susceptibility to Necrotrophic Fungal Pathogens

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular components and host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Arabidopsis mutants defective in four transcription factors (TFs): ZFP2, BHLH99, PAP2, and AT1G66810. These mutants displayed increased disease susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina, and a general activation of non-immune host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility.

    **Main Findings:** Transcriptome analyses revealed a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes in the mutants. We characterized several of these up-regulated genes that encode peptides with a secretion signal, which we named PROVIR (provirulence) factors. Forward and reverse genetic analyses revealed that many of the PROVIRs are important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs.

    **Implications:** The identification of these TFs and PROVIRs provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Our findings suggest that these factors play a crucial role in facilitating fungal pathogenesis, and that their dysregulation can lead to increased disease susceptibility.

    **Conclusions:** We have identified four TFs (ZFP2, BHLH99, PAP2, and AT1G66810) that are required for plant resistance to fungal necrotrophs. These TFs regulate the expression of PROVIRs, which are secreted signaling peptides that contribute to plant disease susceptibility. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular components and host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility, and provides new targets for the development of strategies to improve plant resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens.
Title: Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) Regulates Endometrial Receptivity and Embryo Implantation through Mutual Regulation with Progesterone Receptor (PGR)

    Abstract:
    Background: Successful embryo implantation requires a receptive endometrium, and poor uterine receptivity is a major cause of recurrent pregnancy loss and failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. We investigated the role of the transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) in regulating endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation.

    Methods: We used the progesterone receptor Cre (PgrCre) mouse model to ablate Foxo1 in the uterus and analyzed the effects on endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. We also performed transcriptomic analysis of the uterine transcriptome after Foxo1 ablation and examined the expression of FOXO1 and PGR in human endometrial samples across the menstrual cycle.

    Main Findings: Uterine ablation of Foxo1 resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations in gene expression for transcripts involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling pathway, and an increase in PGR signaling. Constitutive expression of epithelial PGR during the window of receptivity inhibited expression of FOXO1 in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium. Reciprocal expression of PGR and FOXO1 was conserved in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phase.

    Implications: Our findings demonstrate that FOXO1 is a critical regulator of endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. The mutual regulation of FOXO1 and PGR in the endometrial epithelium is essential for establishing the receptive phase, which is characterized by activation of cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, and inhibition of PGR signaling.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. The identification of FOXO1 as a critical regulator of endometrial receptivity highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss and failed IVF cycles. Furthermore, the reciprocal expression of FOXO1 and PGR in human endometrial samples suggests that this regulatory relationship is conserved across species, underscoring the importance of FOXO1 and PGR in establishing a receptive endometrium for successful embryo implantation.

    **Title:** Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Dengue Incidence in Bangladesh: Accounting for Zero-Inflation and Under-Reporting

    **Background:** Dengue fever is a significant public health concern in Bangladesh, but its geographical distribution and transmission patterns are not well understood due to under-reporting and zero-inflation in surveillance data.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the spatial variation in monthly dengue cases in Bangladesh, accounting for zero-inflation and under-reporting, to inform targeted control and elimination interventions.

    **Methods:** We developed a negative binomial generalized linear mixed effect model with zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects to analyze district-level (n = 64) monthly reported dengue cases aggregated over 2000-2009. Bayesian inference was performed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation.

    **Main Findings:** Our model revealed that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Mean monthly rainfall at two months lag was positively associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated that 92% of annual dengue cases occurred between August and September, with 94% of cases reported in the capital, Dhaka.

    **Implications:** Our study provides model-based estimates of the monthly geographical distribution of dengue cases in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reporting and zero-inflation. The findings highlight the importance of temperature and rainfall in dengue transmission and suggest that densely populated districts and those bordering neighboring countries are at higher risk.

    **Conclusions:** This study contributes to the understanding of dengue epidemiology in Bangladesh and provides valuable information for prioritizing and targeting control and elimination interventions. However, further research is needed to investigate potential causes of geographical variation in dengue transmission, such as climate and socio-demographic factors.

    **Title:** Unveiling Knots: A Novel Type of Preferred Places in Mouse Exploratory Behavior

    **Research Question:** What are the characteristics and functions of knots, a newly identified type of preferred places established by mice during exploratory behavior in a novel environment?

    **Methods:** In this study, mice were introduced to a large empty arena and their exploratory behavior was recorded. Path curvatures were analyzed to identify circumscribed locales marked by tortuous paths, which were termed knots. Mice were also injected with saline and placed in an exposed portion of the arena to examine the effects of stress and arousal on knot establishment.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that mice establish knots, characterized by a high path density, frequent visits without scribbling, and a higher speed on the way into the knot than on the way out. Knots are typically situated in the place of introduction into the arena, away from walls, and are not characterized by the features of a home base, except for a high speed during inbound and a low speed during outbound paths. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that knots serve as self-generated, often centrally located landmarks that allow mice to obtain an overview of the entire environment, re-calibrate their locale map, and compass directions. The rich vestibular input generated by knot-scribbling could improve the interpretation of the visual scene.

    **Conclusions:** This study reveals a new type of preferred places, knots, established by mice during exploratory behavior in a novel environment. Knots are characterized by a unique behavior, knot-scribbling, which involves tracing a tortuous path full of twists and turns. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying exploratory behavior and suggest that knots play a crucial role in spatial navigation and mapping. Further research is needed to fully understand the functions and significance of knots in mouse behavior.

    **Title:** Identification of NGx04 as a Novel Antifungal Compound Targeting Sec14p in Cryptococcus neoformans

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism of action of NGx04, an ergoline compound identified in an antifungal screen, and can it be used as a novel antifungal agent against Cryptococcus neoformans?

    **Methods:** High-resolution chemogenomics and genetic assays were used to identify the target of NGx04 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans. The lipid transfer protein Sec14p was identified as the target of NGx04, and compound-resistant mutations in Sec14p were used to define compound-target interactions in the substrate binding pocket of the protein.

    **Main Findings:** NGx04 was found to inhibit the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoformans, and NGx04-related compounds showed equal or even higher potency against C. neoformans. Furthermore, NGx04 analogues showed fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans strain. Saturating mutagenesis of the SEC14 gene identified four key residues that reduced NGx04 potency, and chemogenomic profiling identified hypersensitivity and resistance of deletion strains related to the action of Sec14p.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study suggest that NGx04 is a novel antifungal compound that targets Sec14p, a protein essential for the pathogenicity of C. neoformans. Sec14p is involved in the secretion of virulence determinants essential for the pathogenicity of C. neoformans, making it an attractive target for antifungal therapy. The conservation of Sec14p across fungal species suggests that targeting this protein may be efficacious in other fungal pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** This study presents genetic evidence that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and initial data supporting NGx04 as a novel antifungal starting point. The findings of this study highlight the potential of NGx04 as a lead compound for the development of antifungal therapies against C. neoformans and other fungal pathogens. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of NGx04 and to explore its potential as a novel antifungal agent.

    **Title:** Mefloquine Exhibits Promising Antischistosomal Properties in Mice: A Novel Lead for Schistosomiasis Treatment

    **Research Question:** Can the antimalarial drug mefloquine be repurposed as an antischistosomal agent to combat schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that exacerbates poverty?

    **Methods:** In this study, we investigated the antischistosomal efficacy of mefloquine in mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum. Mice were orally administered a single dose of mefloquine (200 or 400 mg/kg) and worm burden reductions were assessed.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a single dose of mefloquine resulted in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions (72.3-100%) in mice infected with adult S. mansoni or S. japonicum. Notably, high worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum harbored in the mouse. Furthermore, both mefloquine enantiomers exhibited high and comparable total and female worm burden reductions in mice with either sub-patent or patent S. mansoni infections.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that mefloquine may serve as a novel antischistosomal drug, offering a promising alternative to the current single-drug treatment for schistosomiasis, praziquantel. The consistently high worm burden reductions observed against all development stages of the schistosome worms in the rodent model are an advantage of mefloquine over praziquantel, which only displays high activity against very young stages and adult schistosomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for the antischistosomal properties of mefloquine, a widely used antimalarial drug. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism of action and to investigate the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes. Given the co-existence of malaria and schistosomiasis in many regions, it will be interesting to explore the potential impact of mefloquine on schistosomiasis in areas where both diseases co-occur.

    **Title:** Mapping the Distribution of Podoconiosis in Cameroon: A National Population-Based Survey

    **Research Question:** What is the prevalence and distribution of podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis, in Cameroon?

    **Methods:** This study employed a multi-stage sampling design with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis. A total of 76 villages from 40 health districts across 10 regions of Cameroon were surveyed. All individuals aged 15 years and older were screened for lymphedema, and a clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoconiosis, excluding filarial-associated lymphedema. Participants with lymphedema were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and specific IgG4 using Alere Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) and Standard Diagnostics (SD) BIOLINE lymphatic filariasis IgG4 test (Wb123), respectively.

    **Main Findings:** A total of 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated in the study, and 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified. Of these, two were found to be FTS positive, but all were negative using the Wb123 test. No microfilaria of W. bancrofti were found in the night blood of any individual with clinical lymphedema. After applying the clinical algorithm, 52 people with podoconiosis were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.4-0.7). Podoconiosis was found to be widespread in Cameroon, with at least one case identified in every region except the two surveyed villages in Adamawa.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates the low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. The findings highlight the need for a health system response to the burden of podoconiosis, including case surveillance and morbidity management services. Designing a podoconiosis control program is a vital next step.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first national population-based survey of podoconiosis in Cameroon, providing estimates of prevalence using clinical, parasitological, and serological results among people aged 15 years and older. The study demonstrates the importance of combining clinical, parasitological, and serological methods to exclude other potential causes of lymphedema and reach a diagnosis of podoconiosis. The findings support the need for inclusion of podoconiosis in routine screening for neglected tropical diseases at the primary health care level.

    **Title:** Notch Signaling Regulates Germline Stem Cell Niche Occupancy during Aging in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** How does Notch signaling influence the occupancy of germline stem cells (GSCs) in their niche during aging?

    **Methods:** We used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to investigate the role of Notch signaling in GSCs and their niche during aging. We employed clonal analysis, mitotic recombination, and RNA interference (RNAi) to manipulate Notch signaling in GSCs. We also used a constitutively-active form of Notch (NNICD) driven by nos-GAL4 to enhance Notch signaling in GSCs.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Notch signaling is increased with age in Drosophila female GSCs, leading to their removal from the niche. Clonal analysis revealed that GSCs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, out-competing their neighbors with higher levels of Notch. This adhesiveness is altered through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch signaling in GSCs hastens their age-dependent loss from the niche, and this loss is at least partially mediated by Sex lethal. In contrast, disruption of Notch signaling in GSCs does not delay GSC loss during aging, and nor does it affect BMP signaling, which promotes self-renewal of GSCs.

    **Implications:** Our findings expose a novel role of Notch signaling in controlling GSC-niche adhesion in response to aging. Notch signaling regulates GSC niche occupancy both intrinsically (within GSCs) and extrinsically (within the niche). We also show that Notch activation in the niche, which maintains niche integrity and mediates GSC retention, is reduced with age.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that Notch signaling promotes GSC aging and that such signaling needs to be maintained at a relatively low level in young GSCs for their anchorage to the niche. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of stem cell aging and may also be relevant to metastatic cancer cells, in which Notch signaling suppresses cell adhesion. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the mechanism behind the age-dependent regulation of Notch signaling in GSCs and their niche.

    **Title:** Conservation and Functional Divergence of Conserved Herpesvirus-Encoded Protein Kinases (CHPKs) in Human Herpesviruses

    **Research Question:** Do the conserved herpesvirus-encoded protein kinases (CHPKs) exhibit similar Cdk-like activities across different human herpesvirus families?

    **Methods:** We expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each CHPK in human Saos-2 cells, U-2 OS cells, and S. cerevisiae cdc28-13 mutant cells to test for Rb phosphorylation, lamin A phosphorylation, nuclear lamina disruption, and Cdk function.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs are capable of inducing Rb phosphorylation, lamin A phosphorylation, and disrupting the nuclear lamina, whereas the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs lack these activities. Furthermore, all beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs, except for HHV-8 ORF36, displayed authentic Cdk function in the yeast complementation assay. In contrast, the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs failed to exhibit Cdk activity.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the Cdk-like activities of the CHPKs are conserved among the beta- and gamma-herpesviruses, but not among the alpha-herpesviruses. This implies that the CHPKs may have evolved to serve distinct functions in different herpesvirus families.

    **Conclusions:** We have identified novel virally-encoded Cdk-like kinases, which we term v-Cdks. Our data indicate that these related kinases, some of which are targets of approved or developmental antiviral drugs, are likely to serve both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during viral infections. The conservation of these kinases at the genomic and evolutionary level has not been fully maintained at the functional level, highlighting the complexity of their roles in herpesvirus biology. These findings have important implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting the CHPKs.

    **Title:** Global Distribution of Burkholderia pseudomallei: A Systematic Review and Consensus Guidelines for Environmental Sampling

    **Background:** Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Tier 1 Select Agent, is a Gram-negative bacillus responsible for melioidosis, a community-acquired infectious disease prevalent in tropical countries. Understanding the global distribution of B. pseudomallei is crucial for developing a risk map for melioidosis and informing preventive measures.

    **Research Question:** What is the global pattern of B. pseudomallei distribution, and what are the most effective methods for detecting environmental B. pseudomallei?

    **Methods:** A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed (January 1912 to December 2011) with MeSH terms "pseudomallei" or "melioidosis." Bibliographies were hand-searched for secondary references. The reported geographical distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment was mapped and categorized as definite, probable, or possible. The methodology used for detecting environmental B. pseudomallei was extracted and collated.

    **Main Findings:** Global coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable, and not all were robust. A total of 50/61 (82%) environmental studies reported the detection of environmental B. pseudomallei using culture and/or PCR specific for B. pseudomallei.

    **Implications:** The findings highlight the need for a standardized and robust methodology for detecting environmental B. pseudomallei. The proposed consensus guidelines aim to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide affordable and "low-tech" methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries.

    **Conclusions:** This systematic review and consensus guidelines provide the basis for the development of an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei. The proposed guidelines will facilitate the identification of areas where people are at risk of melioidosis, enabling targeted preventive measures and raising awareness among healthcare workers in affected areas.

    **Title:** Inhibition of Dengue Virus Fusion by Targeting a Conformational Intermediate of the Envelope Glycoprotein

    **Research Question:** Can peptides derived from the membrane proximal region of the dengue virus envelope glycoprotein (E) inhibit viral fusion by binding to a conformational intermediate of the E protein?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the mechanism of membrane fusion by dengue virus. We generated peptides derived from the membrane proximal region of the E protein and tested their ability to bind to the postfusion conformation of the E protein, which is a model for a fusion intermediate. We also used in vitro assays to monitor the effects of these peptides on dengue virus fusion with liposomes.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the peptides derived from the membrane proximal region of the E protein bind specifically to the postfusion conformation of the E protein, which is a model for a fusion intermediate. These peptides also inhibit viral infectivity, even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. Our data suggest that the peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes, the compartment in which acidification initiates fusion.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of membrane fusion by dengue virus and suggest strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry. Targeting a viral entry pathway can be an effective way to block infection, and our data support and extend proposed mechanisms for how the E conformational change promotes membrane fusion.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that peptides derived from the membrane proximal region of the E protein can inhibit dengue virus fusion by binding to a conformational intermediate of the E protein. We propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition, in which the peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes, where they inhibit fusion. These findings have important implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting flavivirus entry.

    **Title:** Rapid and Low-Cost Molecular Analysis of Vibrio cholerae in Resource-Limited Settings using Filter Paper Specimens

    **Research Question:** Can stool specimens preserved on filter paper be used for molecular analysis of Vibrio cholerae in resource-limited settings, providing valuable information for public health response and control of cholera outbreaks?

    **Methods:** This study employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to analyze stool specimens preserved on filter paper, enriched in alkaline peptone water (APW), and V. cholerae culture isolates. The minimum concentration of V. cholerae DNA required for quality genomic information was determined to be 0.02 ng/μL.

    **Main Findings:** WGS successfully recovered close to a complete sequence of the V. cholerae O1 genome from stool specimens and culture isolates spotted on filter paper. The genomic data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci. Additionally, WGS identified a variety of diarrheal pathogens from APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper, highlighting the potential for this technique to explore the gut microbiome and identify co-infections that may impact disease severity.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of using filter paper specimens for molecular analysis of V. cholerae in resource-limited settings. The results provide valuable molecular epidemiological information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings, including the identification of co-infecting pathogens and specific V. cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas.

    **Conclusions:** The findings of this study have significant implications for public health response and control of cholera outbreaks. The use of filter paper specimens for WGS provides a rapid, low-cost, and safe method for molecular analysis of V. cholerae in resource-limited settings. This technique has the potential to contribute new information to shape public policy response on cholera control and elimination, ultimately saving lives and reducing the global burden of cholera.

    Title: **Dynein Regulates Epithelial Polarity through mRNA Localization and Alternative Splicing**

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the cytoplasmic Dynein motor in regulating epithelial polarity in Drosophila follicle cells, and how does it interact with the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust (Sdt) and the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb)?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genetic screen for epithelial defects in Drosophila follicle cells (FCs) and identified the cytoplasmic Dynein motor as an essential regulator of apico-basal polarity. We used a combination of molecular and cellular biology techniques, including mRNA localization assays, protein localization experiments, and epistasis analysis, to investigate the relationship between Dynein, Sdt, and Crb.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Dynein is required for the proper targeting of apical proteins, including Sdt and Crb, in FCs. We found that Dynein acts through Sdt to localize Crb to the apical cell surface, and that this process is mediated by the apical targeting of specific Sdt mRNA isoforms. Furthermore, we mapped the Sdt mRNA localization signal to an alternatively spliced coding exon, which corresponds to a developmental switch in Sdt mRNA localization. In early stages of epithelial development, apical Sdt transcripts are present, while in mature epithelia, unlocalized transcripts predominate.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first demonstration that Dynein is required for epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization plays a functional role in regulating apico-basal organization. We also introduce a unique mechanism in which alternative splicing of a coding exon controls mRNA localization during development.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of Dynein in regulating epithelial polarity and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. The discovery of a developmental switch in Sdt mRNA localization controlled by alternative splicing adds a new layer of complexity to our understanding of epithelial development and suggests that mRNA localization may be a key regulator of apico-basal polarity.
Title: Intraclonal Genetic Exchange in Leishmania infantum: A Novel Mechanism of Reproduction in the Sand Fly Vector

    Abstract:
    The mode of reproduction in Leishmania spp. has long been considered clonal, but recent studies suggest the existence of a non-obligate sexual cycle in the extracellular stage of the parasite within the sand fly vector. Here, we investigate the possibility of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. We generated transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters and fed them to Phlebotomus perniciosus sand flies. Our results show that cells with identical genotypes can recognize each other and mate, resulting in the production of triploid hybrid progeny. The hybrid clone was stable throughout the parasite life cycle and exhibited reduced virulence in BALB/c mice, characterized by lower parasite loads in the spleen and liver, and reduced spleen arginase activity. These findings provide evidence for genetic exchange in L. infantum and suggest that the parasite can recognize and mate with cells of the same genotype within the sand fly vector. Our results have significant implications for our understanding of Leishmania biology and the development of novel control strategies for visceral leishmaniasis.

    Methods:
    We generated transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters and fed them to Phlebotomus perniciosus sand flies. The sand flies were then dissected, and the midgut contents were analyzed for the presence of hybrid progeny.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that cells with identical genotypes can recognize each other and mate, resulting in the production of triploid hybrid progeny. The hybrid clone was stable throughout the parasite life cycle and exhibited reduced virulence in BALB/c mice, characterized by lower parasite loads in the spleen and liver, and reduced spleen arginase activity.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide evidence for genetic exchange in L. infantum and suggest that the parasite can recognize and mate with cells of the same genotype within the sand fly vector. This has significant implications for our understanding of Leishmania biology and the development of novel control strategies for visceral leishmaniasis.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates the existence of intraclonal genetic exchange in L. infantum, a novel mechanism of reproduction in the sand fly vector. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of Leishmania biology and the development of novel control strategies for visceral leishmaniasis. Further studies are needed to explore the functionality of the hybrid clones during infections in sand flies and to determine the mechanisms underlying the reduced virulence of the hybrid clone.

    **Title:** Genetic Characterization of Leishmania donovani Strains from Ethiopian Patients with Visceral Leishmaniasis and HIV-VL Co-infections

    **Background:** Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania donovani, is a significant public health concern in Ethiopia. The disease is transmitted by different vectors and exhibits distinct genotypes in various regions. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of L. donovani strains isolated from patients with VL and HIV-VL co-infections in north and south Ethiopia.

    **Methods:** Sixty-three L. donovani strains were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), cysteine protease B (cpb), and HASPB (k26). High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis and DNA sequencing were used to further characterize the strains.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed that the k26-PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290 bp product, while those from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450 bp amplicon. Interestingly, all strains with a 410 bp amplicon were isolated from patients with HIV-VL co-infections. Sequence analysis revealed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs, with the 13 amino acid peptide motifs being rare in L. infantum.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for the development of diagnostic assays and vaccines based on the HASPB antigen. The considerable polymorphism among L. donovani strains from different regions in East Africa highlights the need for region-specific diagnostic tools and vaccines.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genetic diversity of L. donovani strains from Ethiopian patients with VL and HIV-VL co-infections. The results emphasize the importance of considering the geographic origin of the strains when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines. Further research is needed to fully understand the genetic diversity of L. donovani and its implications for disease control and treatment.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Recombination in HIV-1 Evolution: A Probabilistic Model of Copy-Choice Recombination

    **Research Question:** Do recombination events in the HIV-1 genome contribute to the diversity of variants within the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and if so, which regions of the genome are under selective pressure?

    **Methods:** We developed a probabilistic model of HIV-1 copy-choice recombination, which predicts the distribution of breakpoints in the HIV-1 genome based on local sequence identity. We applied this model to recombinant sequences from the HIV-1 pandemic and compared the predicted distributions to the observed distributions of inter-subtype breakpoints.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that, across much of the HIV-1 genome, the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination are accurately predicted by our model, indicating that a probabilistic model dependent on local sequence identity is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, we also identified regions where the distribution of breakpoints deviates from the expected null distribution, suggesting that natural selection is influencing the recombination pattern. Specifically, we found that the env gene has a paucity of recombination breakpoints, indicating that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. In contrast, breakpoints are over-represented at either side of the env gene, suggesting increased selection for these recombinants.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide the first clear indication of the existence of a specific portion of the genome that deviates from a probabilistic null model for recombination. This suggests that, despite the wide diversity of recombinant forms seen in the viral population, only a minority of recombination events appear to be of significance to the evolution of HIV-1.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a clear indication that the majority of recombinant breakpoints detected in the HIV-1 pandemic provide limited selective advantage, with the exception being specific genomic regions in which recombination events have a higher probability of being important to viral evolution. These findings have important implications for our understanding of HIV-1 evolution and the development of effective antiretroviral therapies.

**Title:** A Hierarchical Bayesian Inference Framework for Concurrent Model Comparison, Parameter Estimation, and Population-Level Inference

**Research Question:** Can a novel hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework be developed to simultaneously address the interdependent problems of model comparison, parameter estimation, and population-level inference in computational neuroscience research?

**Methods:** We propose a HBI framework that integrates Bayesian hierarchical techniques to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, while also comparing candidate models and estimating individual variation in the expressed model. This framework leverages variational techniques to address the interdependence between model comparison and parameter estimation.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that the HBI framework has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison. The parameters estimated by the HBI framework exhibit smaller errors compared to other methods, and model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and not biased towards overly simplistic models. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian approach of our theory enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-tests.

**Implications:** The HBI framework has significant implications for computational neuroscience research, as it provides a unified approach to addressing the interdependent problems of model comparison, parameter estimation, and population-level inference. This framework enables researchers to estimate individual variation in parameters, compare candidate models, and make inference on group-level parameters, all within a single framework.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HBI framework in addressing the challenges of model comparison, parameter estimation, and population-level inference in computational neuroscience research. The HBI framework provides a powerful tool for researchers to investigate complex biological systems, and its fully Bayesian approach enables the quantification of uncertainty at both individual and group levels. By addressing the interdependence between model comparison and parameter estimation, the HBI framework has the potential to revolutionize the field of computational neuroscience research.

    **Title:** Rhombomeres and Hox Genes Contribute to the Assembly of Auditory Sensorimotor Circuits in the Developing Brainstem

    **Research Question:** How do individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox genes contribute to the development of auditory sensorimotor circuits in the brainstem?

    **Methods:** We used fate mapping and functional inactivation of Hox genes (Hoxb1, Hoxb2, and Hoxa2) in mice to investigate the role of rhombomeres and Hox genes in the assembly of auditory sensorimotor circuits.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that rhombomere 4 (r4) contributes to the development of functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and motor olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of r4-derived auditory components is involved in sound perception and depends on regulatory interactions between Hoxb1 and Hoxb2. In Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 mutant mice, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost, resulting in hearing impairments. Additionally, Hoxa2 regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior VCN to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. The results also imply that a single rhombomere, r4, contributes to various derivatives of the auditory pathway, which are distributed across several rhombomeres via selective migrations and structurally linked into functional circuits essential for proper hearing.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the role of rhombomeres and Hox genes in the development of auditory sensorimotor circuits in the brainstem. The findings highlight the importance of Hox genes in impinging on r4 identity during rhombomere patterning and suggest that Hox genes are prime candidates to be involved in the assembly of sensorimotor functional circuits in the developing hindbrain. Overall, our results demonstrate that rhombomere-specific and Hox-dependent assembly of the two main central auditory sub-circuits is essential for proper hearing and sound localization.

    **Title:** Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40: A Marine Bacterium with Unprecedented Polysaccharide Degradation Capabilities

    **Research Question:** What is the complete genome sequence of Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40) and how do its enzymes facilitate the degradation of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment?

    **Methods:** We sequenced the complete genome of Sde 2-40 and analyzed its enzymatic capabilities using genomic, qRT-PCR, enzyme activity, and mass spectrometry (MS) studies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that Sde 2-40 possesses an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade >10 complex polysaccharides, including plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment. We identified novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules in many of these enzymes, suggesting adaptations that facilitate depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Sde 2-40 is a key player in the marine carbon cycle, functioning as a "super-degrader" that mediates the breakdown of complex polysaccharides from plants, algae, and invertebrates. This bacterium's enzymatic capabilities are likely to enhance the turnover rates of recalcitrant complex polysaccharides, thereby contributing to atmospheric CO2 inputs.

    **Conclusions:** The complete genome sequence of Sde 2-40 provides insights into its remarkable polysaccharide degradation capabilities, which are likely to have significant implications for our understanding of the marine carbon cycle. Our results highlight the importance of Sde 2-40 as a model organism for studying the degradation of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment, and suggest that this bacterium may play a key role in the recycling of marine biomass carbon. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying Sde 2-40's polysaccharide degradation capabilities and to explore its potential applications in biotechnology and bioremediation.
Title: Investigating the Role of Culex pipiens Mosquitoes in the Genotype Shift of Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) in China

    Abstract:
    Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus responsible for significant childhood viral neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, the genotype dominance of JEV has shifted from Genotype III (GIII) to Genotype I (GI). However, the exact mechanism of this displacement remains unknown. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are the primary vectors in China and play a crucial role in maintaining the enzootic transmission cycle of JEV. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes in the genotype shift of JEV by examining the infectivity, replication kinetics, dissemination rate, and transmission potential of GI and GIII JEV strains in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes.

    Methods:
    Female Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China were orally infected with either GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, whole mosquitoes, secondary organs, and salivary glands were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) and subjected to 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay to measure the infection rate, replication kinetics, dissemination rate, and transmission potential of the infected JEV strains.

    Main Findings:
    Our results showed that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. Both JEV genotypes were detectable in the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes at similar transmission rates, suggesting the potential of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes for transmission of both genotype viruses. Notably, the infection rates and growth kinetics in orally infected Cx. pipiens mosquitoes showed no significant difference between GI- and GIII-infected groups.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift, as both GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes. However, this conclusion is based on the use of a single representative JEV strain from each genotype, and further studies with more diverse GI and GIII JEV strains are necessary to confirm this conclusion.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides new insights into the role of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes in the genotype shift of JEV in China. Our results demonstrate that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes are competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infectivity, replication kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. These findings suggest that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes may not be the primary drivers of JEV genotype shift, and further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon.

Title: Epidemiology and Clinical Characteristics of Dengue Deaths in Malaysia: A Nationwide Retrospective Review

Background: Dengue infection is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. In Malaysia, large dengue outbreaks have been reported in recent years. This study aimed to investigate the demographics and clinical characteristics associated with dengue deaths in Malaysia.

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on all dengue deaths that occurred nationwide between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014. Relevant data were extracted from mortality review reports and investigational forms. The cases were categorized into three age groups: children (<15 years), adults (15-59 years), and elderly (≥60 years) to compare their clinical characteristics.

Results: A total of 322 dengue deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7 ± 19.3 years, and 72.5% were adults. The median durations of first medical contact and hospitalization were 1 and 3 days, respectively. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most common warning signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children (p = 0.038). Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contributed to more than 70% of dengue deaths, followed by severe organ involvement (69%) and severe bleeding (29.7%).

Implications: This study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent dengue deaths, particularly in adult patients. The atypical presentation and dynamic progression of severe dengue in this cohort emphasize the importance of prompt medical attention.

Conclusions: This nationwide retrospective review provides valuable insights into the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of dengue deaths in Malaysia. The findings suggest that DSS is the leading cause of death, regardless of age groups. The results of this study can inform public health strategies and clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of dengue in Malaysia. Further research is needed to strengthen the surveillance system to capture dengue-related deaths that occur at home or as out-patients.

    **Title:** Tissue-Specific Insulin Signaling Regulates Female Attractiveness and Fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** What is the role of insulin signaling in the regulation of female attractiveness and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster, and how do different tissues contribute to this process?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to manipulate insulin signaling in specific tissues of female Drosophila melanogaster, including the fat body, ovarian follicle cells, and oenocytes. We measured the effects of these manipulations on female attractiveness, fecundity, and cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that global manipulation of insulin signaling affects female attractiveness, and that this effect is mediated by insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells. Specifically, we found that insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to those caused by global and late follicle cell manipulations. We also found that modulation of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. Furthermore, all tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, indicating that insulin pathway activity is a reliable link between fecundity and attractiveness cues.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that female attractiveness in Drosophila melanogaster is linked to an organismal state of high fecundity, which is created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells. This system provides a potential mechanism for honesty and reliability in mate choice, as reproductive effort is reflected accurately in late-stage follicle cells. Our results also highlight the importance of tissue-specific insulin signaling in regulating female attractiveness and fecundity.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying female attractiveness and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster, and highlights the importance of insulin signaling in regulating these traits. Our findings have implications for our understanding of mate choice and the evolution of reproductive strategies in animals.
Title: Investigating District-Level Transmissibility of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa: A Statistical Modeling Approach

    Abstract:
    The 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa exhibited heterogeneous transmission patterns across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To elucidate district-level transmissibility of EVD, we employed a statistical modeling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each affected district and country. Using weekly incident case numbers, we estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak and fitted a mixed effects model to account for heterogeneity between and within countries. Our results show that R0 ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone at the district level. At the national level, we estimated R0 to be 0.97 (95% CI: 0.77-1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95% CI: 0.98-1.55) for Liberia, and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.32-2.00) for Sierra Leone. Notably, socio-demographic variables related to urbanization, such as high population density and wealth index, were positively associated with R0, suggesting that rapid urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD. Our study highlights the importance of considering local dynamics in understanding the transmission of infectious diseases and underscores the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the consequences of urbanization on disease spread.

    Research Question:
    What is the district-level transmissibility of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, and how do socio-demographic variables influence the spread of the disease?

    Methods:
    We used a statistical modeling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each affected district and country in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. We employed exponential regression to estimate growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak and fitted a mixed effects model to account for heterogeneity between and within countries.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that R0 ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone at the district level. At the national level, we estimated R0 to be 0.97 (95% CI: 0.77-1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95% CI: 0.98-1.55) for Liberia, and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.32-2.00) for Sierra Leone.

    Implications:
    Our study highlights the importance of considering local dynamics in understanding the transmission of infectious diseases. The positive association between R0 and socio-demographic variables related to urbanization suggests that rapid urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the consequences of urbanization on disease spread.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates the utility of a statistical modeling approach in estimating district-level transmissibility of EVD in West Africa. The results emphasize the importance of considering local dynamics in understanding the transmission of infectious diseases and highlight the need for targeted interventions to address the consequences of urbanization on disease spread.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Interplay between Structural Properties and Evolutionary Age in Protein Evolution

    **Research Question:** What is the relative role of intrinsic factors of present-day proteins versus historical factors such as protein age in determining a protein's rate of evolution?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins, with mapped PDB structures, to investigate the interplay between structural properties and evolutionary age as determinants of protein evolutionary rate.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that previously observed structural correlations between solvent accessibility, designability, and evolutionary rates hold within each age group. However, we found that age also plays a crucial role in modulating the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins. Furthermore, we introduced a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation and found that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and more robust to mutations than younger ones.

    **Implications:** Our findings underscore that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution. The results suggest that protein age is an important factor in shaping evolutionary rates, above and beyond the influence of solvent accessibility and secondary structure. We also show that structural biases among age groups cannot explain the previously reported differences in evolutionary rates with age.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between structural properties and evolutionary age in protein evolution. The findings highlight the importance of considering both intrinsic and historical factors in understanding the evolution of proteins. The results have implications for our understanding of protein evolution and may inform the development of new methods for predicting protein evolutionary rates and stability.
Title: Polycomb-Like 3 (Pcl3) Promotes Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal and Histone Methylation through Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) Interaction

    Abstract:
    The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development, embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, and cancer. We investigated the function of Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3), a component of PRC2, in ESC self-renewal and histone methylation. Using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified Pcl3 as a Suz12 binding partner and confirmed its interactions with core PRC2 components. Knockdown of Pcl3 in ESCs increased spontaneous differentiation, while overexpression of Pcl3 increased H3K27me3 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of Pcl3 decreased Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues within the Pcl3 Tudor domain compromised H3K27me3 formation, indicating that the Tudor domain of Pcl3 is essential for its function. Furthermore, Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind many of the same PRC2 targets, particularly CpG islands regulated by Pcl3. Our findings demonstrate that Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 that promotes ESC self-renewal, histone methylation, and recruitment of PRC2 to a subset of its genomic sites.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3) in regulating embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and histone methylation through its interaction with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)?

    Methods:
    We used mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify Pcl3 as a Suz12 binding partner and confirm its interactions with core PRC2 components. We also performed knockdown and overexpression experiments to assess the effects of Pcl3 on ESC self-renewal and histone methylation.

    Main Findings:
    We found that Pcl3 promotes ESC self-renewal and histone methylation through its interaction with PRC2. Knockdown of Pcl3 increased spontaneous differentiation, while overexpression of Pcl3 increased H3K27me3 levels. ChIP-seq revealed that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of Pcl3 decreased Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues within the Pcl3 Tudor domain compromised H3K27me3 formation.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 that regulates ESC self-renewal and histone methylation. The Tudor domain of Pcl3 is essential for its function, and Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind many of the same PRC2 targets.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Pcl3 plays a crucial role in regulating ESC self-renewal and histone methylation through its interaction with PRC2. Further investigation of Pcl3 function may provide insight into how Pcl3 up-regulation returns cancer cells to transcriptional states and self-renewal capacities similar to those of ESCs.

    **Title:** Cell-Autonomous and Non-Cell-Autonomous Transcriptional Mechanisms Regulate Chemoreceptor Gene Expression in Caenorhabditis elegans in Response to Feeding State

    **Research Question:** How do Caenorhabditis elegans modify their chemosensory behavior in response to changes in feeding state, and what are the underlying transcriptional mechanisms that regulate chemoreceptor gene expression?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of the chemoreceptor gene srh-234 in the ADL sensory neuron of C. elegans and its regulation by the MEF-2 transcription factor and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in response to feeding state.

    **Main Findings:** We show that MEF-2 acts together with bHLH transcription factors to regulate srh-234 expression as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory MEF2 binding site is necessary and sufficient for the starvation-induced downregulation of srh-234 expression, while an E-box site is required to drive srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. We also identify HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4 as bHLH factors that act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression levels of srh-234 in ADL neurons are regulated remotely by MXL-3 and HLH-30 acting in the intestine, which is dependent on insulin signaling functioning specifically in ADL neurons.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that chemoreceptor gene expression is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms mediated by MEF2 and bHLH factors, which may allow animals to fine-tune their chemosensory responses in response to changes in their feeding state.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate chemoreceptor gene expression in C. elegans in response to feeding state. The identification of MEF2 and bHLH factors as key regulators of srh-234 expression highlights the complexity of chemosensory behavior in C. elegans and provides a framework for understanding how animals integrate and translate feeding-state information into proper expression changes of individual chemoreceptor genes.
Title: Investigating the Role of Mosquitoes in the Transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans in Southeastern Australia: A Correlational Study

    Abstract:

    Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a debilitating skin condition caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is not fully understood, but several studies suggest that biting insects may play a role. This study aimed to investigate the association between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of BU disease in humans in an endemic area of southeastern Australia.

    Methods: Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from December 2004 to December 2009 and screened for M. ulcerans using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of BU in permanent residents of these towns diagnosed during the same period was tallied to determine the average cumulative incidence of BU in each location. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for the proportion of M. ulcerans-positive mosquitoes per town correlated with the incidence of BU per town.

    Main Findings: We found a strong dose-response relationship between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease (r = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99; p < 0.001). The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia.

    Implications: The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU. Public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged in endemic areas.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that mosquitoes play a role in the transmission of M. ulcerans to humans in southeastern Australia. The strong correlation between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the incidence of BU disease suggests that mosquitoes may be a key vector in the spread of this disease. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of M. ulcerans in other BU endemic areas, including Queensland and Africa.

    **Title:** Molecular Characterization of the Rat Demyelination (dmy) Mutation and Its Implications for Myelin Maintenance

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of the rat demyelination (dmy) mutation, and how does it contribute to the breakdown of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS)?

    **Methods:** We employed positional cloning to identify the molecular defect responsible for the demyelinating phenotype in adult dmy/dmy rats. We found a G-to-A transition in the Mrs2 gene, which generated a novel splice acceptor site and resulted in functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA validated our findings.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that the dmy/dmy rats have major mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, a 60% reduction in ATP, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed that MRS2 was dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and was ultrastructurally observed in the inner membrane of mitochondria.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease, and that the maintenance of myelin has a different mechanism from its initial production. We also established that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin.

    **Conclusions:** The dmy/dmy mutation is a loss-of-function mutation of the Mrs2 gene, which encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria. The demyelination observed in dmy/dmy rats is likely enhanced by activated microglia and astroglia. Our study provides new insights into the pathomechanisms underlying demyelination and highlights the importance of mitochondrial function in myelin maintenance. The dmy/dmy rat model may serve as a valuable tool for investigating the pathophysiology of demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis.

    Title: Improving the Reliability of Microarray Gene Expression Signatures for Disease Diagnosis and Prognosis

    Background: Microarray gene expression signatures have the potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, the current documentation standards for these signatures hinder their independent evaluation and application in clinical practice.

    Research Question: Can the consistency of study-internal and study-external diagnoses based on microarray gene expression signatures be improved by better documentation of the signatures?

    Methods: We analyzed data from eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and evaluated the consistency of study-internal and study-external diagnoses. Study-external classifications were based on documented information only. We also proposed a new documentation strategy, "documentation by value," which includes quantitative preprocessing information.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as high as 30% (worst case) and 18% (median). However, by using the proposed documentation by value strategy, the median discrepancy was reduced to 1%. This suggests that better documentation of the signatures can significantly improve the consistency of diagnoses.

    Implications: Our study highlights the importance of unambiguous documentation of microarray gene expression signatures for their reliable application in clinical practice. The proposed documentation by value strategy provides a framework for building and documenting signatures in a way that minimizes ambiguity.

    Conclusions: The process of evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice can be substantially improved and made more reliable by better documentation of the signatures. Our results demonstrate that the proposed documentation by value strategy can significantly reduce the discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses, making it a valuable tool for improving the reliability of microarray gene expression signatures in disease diagnosis and prognosis.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into Curli Amyloid Fibrils and Their Role in Biofilm Formation and Resistance to Environmental Stressors

    **Research Question:** What are the structural features of curli amyloid fibrils secreted by Enterobacteriaceae and how do they contribute to biofilm formation and bacterial resistance to environmental stressors?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the high-resolution structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA. We also investigated the effects of D-enantiomeric peptides, originally designed to interfere with Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloid-β, on CsgA fibrillation and biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium.

    **Main Findings:** Our structural analysis revealed steric zipper fibrils of tightly mated β-sheets in CsgA amyloid fibrils, demonstrating a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids. We found that D-enantiomeric peptides inhibited CsgA fibrillation and reduced biofilm formation in S. typhimurium, suggesting a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms. Furthermore, we observed that CsgA fibrils cross-seeded fibrillation of amyloid-β, providing support for the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation and suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms. We also hypothesize on the formation of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source that could influence neurodegenerative diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals the structural features of curli amyloid fibrils and their role in biofilm formation and bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. The identification of D-enantiomeric peptides as inhibitors of CsgA fibrillation and biofilm formation opens up new avenues for the development of antivirulence agents targeting amyloid-structured biofilms. Further investigation into the promiscuity of anti-amyloid therapeutics as antivirulence agents is warranted.

    **Title:** Epidemiology of Japanese Encephalitis in the Philippines: A Systematic Review and Surveillance Data Analysis

    **Background:** Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) is a significant cause of encephalitis in most of Asia, with high case fatality rates and long-term neurologic sequelae among survivors. Despite its importance, the epidemiology of JE in the Philippines remains poorly defined.

    **Research Question:** What is the burden of Japanese Encephalitis in the Philippines, and what are the implications for the introduction of JE vaccine into the national immunization schedule?

    **Methods:** We conducted a systematic literature review of 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including serologic surveys, clinical cases, and animal studies. We also analyzed surveillance data from the national reference laboratory from January 2011 to March 2014.

    **Main Findings:** Our review identified 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972 to 2013, with JE virus (JEV) being the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16-40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age, with 6-7% of cases resulting in death. Surveillance data from January 2011 to March 2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested.

    **Implications:** This comprehensive review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance with laboratory confirmation is needed to systematically quantify the burden of JE, provide information for prioritization of high-risk areas, and measure the impact of preventive measures, including immunization.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that JE constitutes a significant public health burden in all regions of the Philippines, with epidemiologic characteristics comparable to those found in other endemic countries in Asia. The evidence supports consideration of the inclusion of JE vaccine in the national immunization program to prevent this important public health threat.
Title: Deciphering the Evolutionary Origins of Genetic Robustness in Bacterial Metabolic Networks: A Large-Scale Computational Study

    Abstract:
    The evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacteria remain a topic of debate, with various factors contributing to its emergence, including environmental conditions, metabolic requirements, and adaptive selection. To elucidate the individual effects of these origins, we conducted a large-scale computational study on the metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across diverse simulated growth environments. Our results provide evidence that variations in genetic robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. We decoupled metabolic robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent. The environmental-dependent component accounts for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle (specialized/generalist). In contrast, the environmental-independent component is linked to intrinsic metabolic capacities, with higher robustness observed in fast growers or organisms with extensive secondary metabolite production. Furthermore, we identified reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. Our findings support the notion that the need to increase metabolic capacities has driven the evolution of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks. This study provides new insights into the complex interplay between environmental and intrinsic factors shaping the evolution of genetic robustness in bacteria.

    Research Question:
    What are the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks, and how do environmental and intrinsic factors contribute to its emergence?

    Title: Schistosoma mansoni Infection Impairs Measles Vaccine Responses in Pre-School Children: A Randomized Trial of Praziquantel Treatment

    Background: Schistosoma mansoni infection is known to modulate the immune system, potentially influencing responses to non-schistosome antigens, including vaccines. We investigated the effects of S. mansoni infection on responses to childhood measles catch-up immunization and the impact of praziquantel treatment on this outcome in a randomized trial.

    Methods: The Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunization (IMoChI) study was conducted in Entebbe, Uganda. Children aged 3-5 years (193 S. mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive praziquantel treatment 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles catch-up immunization. Plasma anti-measles IgG levels were measured at enrollment, 1 week, and 24 weeks after immunization.

    Main Findings: S. mansoni-infected children had lower anti-measles IgG levels and a lower percentage of participants with protective antibody levels compared to uninfected children at 1 week post-immunization. However, among S. mansoni-infected children, those treated with praziquantel before or at the time of immunization had higher anti-measles IgG levels compared to those who did not receive treatment. At 24 weeks post-immunization, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who remained S. mansoni stool-positive.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection among pre-school children is associated with a reduced antibody response to catch-up measles immunization, and that praziquantel treatment improves the response. This may contribute to impaired vaccine responses in endemic populations, highlighting the importance of effective schistosomiasis control for vaccine efficacy.

    Conclusions: This randomized trial provides evidence that S. mansoni infection impairs measles vaccine responses in pre-school children, and that praziquantel treatment can improve this response. These findings have important implications for the control of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this association and to determine the optimal timing and duration of praziquantel treatment to maximize vaccine efficacy.

    **Title:** Large-Scale Analysis of Bacterial Population Structure: Introducing Statistical Tools for Recombination Detection and Population Representation

    **Research Question:** How can we accurately infer the genetic structure and ancestry of bacterial populations from large-scale sequencing data, accounting for recombination and admixture events?

    **Methods:** We developed and implemented novel statistical tools in the BAPS 5.2 software to detect and represent recombination between populations, as well as a model-based description of population shape in sequence space. We applied these tools to a comprehensive dataset of 5086 Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria lactamica strains, assuming a simplified evolutionary model with a common local ancestor and a global ancestor.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate the potential of combining population genetic tools with phylogenetic analysis to uncover complex patterns of ancestry and admixture in bacterial populations. We show that traditional methods, such as phylogenetic analysis, may provide a distorted view of ancestral relationships when recombination events are common. Our statistical tools, implemented in BAPS 5.2, enable the analysis of bacterial population structures on an unprecedented scale, even in the presence of complex patterns of admixture.

    **Implications:** The ability to accurately infer bacterial population structure and ancestry has significant implications for understanding the evolution and epidemiology of bacterial pathogens. Our methods can be applied to large-scale datasets, such as those hosted by the MLST (Multilocus Sequence Typing) database, to investigate the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of bacterial populations.

    **Conclusions:** We introduce a novel approach to large-scale analysis of bacterial population structure, combining statistical tools for recombination detection and population representation with phylogenetic analysis. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach to uncover complex patterns of ancestry and admixture in bacterial populations, and highlight the importance of considering recombination events in evolutionary inference. The BAPS 5.2 software, which implements these tools, is freely available for download, enabling researchers to apply these methods to their own datasets.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Functional Roles of Beta Rhythms in Sensory Cortical Areas: A Computational Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** Can top-down beta rhythms, generated in higher cognitive areas and delivered to earlier sensory areas, support attentional gain modulation by biasing competition in superficial layers of sensory cortical areas?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model of sensory cortical areas to investigate the functional roles of beta rhythms and underlying mechanisms. Our model simulated the activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in different layers of the cortex, including L5, L4, and L2/3.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulation results show that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. We found that slow-inhibitory interneurons in L5 resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate the activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. Our model predicts that these cells play a critical role in attentional gain modulation, providing a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that top-down beta rhythms can bias competition in superficial layers by modulating the activity of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic projections from L5 cells to upper layers. This mechanism is consistent with the pattern of neural response modulation induced by attention reported in previous studies. Specifically, we found that top-down beta rhythms associated with attention inside the receptive field (RF) can enhance gamma rhythms in L2/3, reduce beta rhythms in L2/3, and enhance spiking activity of L2/3 RS cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational model provides a novel proposal that interlaminar interaction, regulated by top-down beta rhythms, supports selective attention. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural correlates of attentional gain control and provide a potential mechanism by which top-down signals can bias competition in sensory cortical areas. Our results highlight the importance of beta rhythms in attentional processing and provide a framework for further investigation into the neural mechanisms underlying selective attention.

    **Title:** Calibration and Prediction of Stochastic Epidemic Models using Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS)

    **Research Question:** Can a novel calibration and prediction framework, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), accurately estimate key epidemic parameters and predict the future course of epidemics during the early emergence of novel pathogens?

    **Methods:** We developed MSS, a stochastic compartmental transmission model that applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the true epidemic state using each new surveillance observation. We evaluated MSS using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, assuming weekly counts of new diagnosed cases as an imperfect proxy of incidence.

    **Main Findings:** MSS produced accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters, including mean duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, as well as an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also accurately predicted the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compared MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods and found that MSS significantly outperformed each of these methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that MSS can address several major challenges inherent in parameter estimation and model-based prediction during outbreaks, where the true epidemic state can be only partially observed and the behavior of disease spread is most stochastic. This method has the potential to improve predictions about the future course of epidemics and inform public health decision-making.

    **Conclusions:** MSS is a promising method for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics. Its ability to accurately estimate key epidemic parameters and predict the future course of epidemics makes it a valuable tool for public health decision-makers during the early emergence of novel pathogens. Our results demonstrate the potential of MSS to improve on current approaches and provide a new framework for addressing the challenges of parameter estimation and model-based prediction during outbreaks.

    **Title:** Serial Dependence in Visual Perception: A Unified Account of the Interplay between Sensory Adaptation and Decisional Traces

    **Research Question:** How do past sensory and decisional events shape human visual perception, and what are the underlying mechanisms of serial dependence in visual perception?

    **Methods:** We employed multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks in a series of experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Our results revealed that each perceptual report is influenced by two contrasting forces: low-level adaptation, which repels perception away from previous stimuli, and decisional traces, which attract perceptual reports toward the recent past. This hierarchy of serial dependence gives rise to "continuity fields" that arise from the inertia of decisional templates, rather than low-level sensory processes.

    **Implications:** Our findings support a Two-process model of serial dependence, where the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. We propose a unified account of serial dependence, where functionally distinct mechanisms operating at different stages promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

    **Conclusions:** Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of visual serial dependence, demonstrating that two contrasting forces shape our perception, biasing the appearance of visual stimuli toward or away from the past. We show that decisional traces have a significant impact on current perceptual decisions, even when interleaved with new stimuli. Our results challenge the assumption that serial dependence originates from low-level continuity fields and instead reveal two mechanisms regulating serial dependence: a repulsive force after sensory exposure and an attractive force after perceptual reports. This unified account of serial dependence highlights the complex interplay between sensory adaptation and decisional traces in shaping our visual experience and reactions to environmental stimuli.

    **Title:** Enhancing Circadian Transcription with a CYC-VP16 Fusion Protein Reveals its Role in Core Circadian Timekeeping in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** What is the role of transcription in core circadian timekeeping in Drosophila, and how does the addition of a potent transcriptional activator, VP16, to the CLK-CYC heterodimer affect circadian function?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the effects of a CYC-VP16 fusion protein in the Drosophila system using S2 cells and transgenic flies. The CYC-VP16 fusion protein combines the DNA-binding domain of CYC with the potent transcriptional activator VP16.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the addition of VP16 to the CLK-CYC heterodimer imparts strongly enhanced transcriptional activity relative to the wild-type CLK-CYC complex. This increase in transcriptional activity is manifested in both S2 cells and flies expressing CYC-VP16, leading to increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs, including those from per and tim. Moreover, CYC-VP16-expressing flies have a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the timing of transcriptional activation, rather than the activation itself, is the key event responsible for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. The increased transcriptional activity of the CLK-CYC-VP16 complex leads to more rapid accumulation of PER and a consequent advanced phase of per repression, resulting in a short period.

    **Conclusions:** Our results indicate that circadian transcription contributes to core circadian function in Drosophila. The addition of VP16 to the CLK-CYC heterodimer enhances transcriptional activity, leading to increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs and a short period. These findings provide new insights into the role of transcription in core circadian timekeeping and highlight the importance of the timing of transcriptional activation in regulating circadian function.
Title: Species-Specific Activation of the PmrA/PmrB Two-Component System by the Horizontally Acquired PmrD Gene Product

    Abstract:
    The integration of horizontally acquired genes into a new species can confer novel traits, but the functionality of these genes can be constrained by preexisting proteins in the host organism. Here, we investigate how the horizontally acquired pmrD gene product activates the ancestral PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica but not in the closely related bacterium Escherichia coli. Our results show that the Salmonella PmrD protein binds to the phosphorylated PmrA protein (PmrA-P), protecting it from dephosphorylation by the PmrB protein, leading to the transcription of PmrA-dependent genes, including those conferring polymyxin B resistance. In contrast, the E. coli PmrD protein cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli, suggesting that these two species differ in an additional component controlling PmrA-P levels. We identify the E. coli PmrB protein as the key component responsible for this difference, exhibiting higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB protein. Replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog is sufficient to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. Our findings provide a unique example of how quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of orthologous ancestral proteins dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits, and suggest that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci.

    Methods:
    We used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the activation of the PmrA/PmrB system by the pmrD gene product in Salmonella enterica and E. coli. We cloned and expressed the pmrD and pmrB genes from both species in E. coli and Salmonella, and measured the activity of the PmrA/PmrB system using in vitro assays and transcriptional analysis.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the Salmonella PmrD protein binds to PmrA-P, protecting it from dephosphorylation by PmrB, leading to the transcription of PmrA-dependent genes. In contrast, the E. coli PmrD protein cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli. We identify the E. coli PmrB protein as the key component responsible for this difference, exhibiting higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB protein. Replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog is sufficient to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide a unique example of how quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of orthologous ancestral proteins dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits. This suggests that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci, and highlights the importance of considering the biochemical properties of preexisting proteins in the host organism when predicting the functionality of horizontally acquired genes.

    Conclusions:
    In summary, our study demonstrates that the horizontally acquired pmrD gene product activates the ancestral PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica but not in E. coli due to differences in the biochemical activities of the PmrB protein. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of new traits in bacteria and the role of horizontally acquired genes in shaping species-specific traits.
Title: Identification of Novel Regulators of Pluripotency and Self-Renewal in Embryonic Stem Cells using a Novel Statistical Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is a complex process initiated by a gradual loss of pluripotency-associated transcripts and induction of differentiation genes. Identifying the causal genes that promote or inhibit differentiation is crucial for understanding this process.

    Research Question: Can a novel statistical approach, the Differentiation-Test, be used to identify differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation in embryonic stem cells, and can these genes be experimentally verified as regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal?

    Methods: We applied the Differentiation-Test to analyze the differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies, using biological replicates and a novel statistical approach. We then experimentally verified the identified genes using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to study two transcription regulators, Smarcad1 and Pias2.

    Main Findings: The Differentiation-Test identified Smarcad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal, which was experimentally verified using shRNA. We also identified a downregulated module (pluripotency module) and an upregulated module (differentiation module) of genes during differentiation.

    Implications: The Differentiation-Test provides a principled approach for identifying differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation, which can be used to identify novel regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal. This approach can be generally applicable to analyze other differentiation processes.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the utility of the Differentiation-Test in identifying novel regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. The identification of Smarcad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal highlights the potential of this approach in understanding the complex process of cellular differentiation.

    **Title:** Overcoming Confounding Bias in Functional Analysis of Gene Variants: An Integrative Method for Identifying Disease-Relevant Pathways

    **Research Question:** How can we improve the accuracy of functional analysis of gene variants in next-generation sequencing studies by controlling for confounding bias in coding-sequence length?

    **Methods:** We developed an integrative method to infer functional associations between human genes from diverse data types, including protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression networks. We assessed the phenotypic agreement of the inferred links using a novel phenotype-based method and controlled for the heretofore unexplored confounding bias in coding-sequence length.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that genes implicated through de novo sequence variants are biased in their coding-sequence length, leading to exaggerated p-values in functional studies. We found that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. Our method, which takes advantage of over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and fully exploits bio-ontologies by means of semantic similarity, demonstrates superior power to identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease, even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of controlling for confounding bias in coding-sequence length in functional analysis of gene variants. By doing so, we can reduce the risk of false positive findings and improve the accuracy of disease-relevant pathway identification. Our method has the potential to revolutionize the interpretation of variants in next-generation sequencing studies, particularly in the context of polygenic disorders.

    **Conclusions:** Our integrative method provides a powerful tool for identifying functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease, even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias. By controlling for confounding bias in coding-sequence length, we can improve the accuracy of disease-relevant pathway identification and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Our study demonstrates the suitability of this method for functionally clustering variant genes underlying polygenic disorders and highlights its potential to enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of human disease.

    **Title:** Evaluation of Mexico’s Nonessential Food and Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes: A Longitudinal Analysis of Household Purchases

    **Research Question:** Did the implementation of an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in Mexico lead to changes in the volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases among households of varying socioeconomic status (SES)?

    **Methods:** This study used data from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services (CPS) to analyze household packaged food purchases from January 2012 to December 2014. A longitudinal, fixed-effects model was employed to examine changes in the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods, adjusting for preexisting trends and controlling for household characteristics and contextual factors.

    **Main Findings:** The results showed that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods decreased by 25 g (95% CI = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what was expected based on pre-tax trends, with no corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected (-44 [-72, -16] g per capita per month), while medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected (-28 [-46, -11] g per capita per month). High SES households showed no statistically significant change in purchases.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that the implementation of taxes on nonessential foods and SSBs in Mexico led to a decline in the volume of taxed food purchases, with lower SES households being more responsive to the tax. The results have implications for policymakers in Mexico and other countries considering the implementation of food taxes.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that taxes on nonessential foods and SSBs can lead to a reduction in the volume of taxed food purchases, particularly among lower SES households. Future studies should evaluate the impact of these taxes on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns to inform policy decisions.

    **Title:** A Biophysically Plausible Model of Collision-Sensitive Neurons with Power Law Response Properties

    **Research Question:** What biophysical mechanisms underlie the power law response properties of collision-sensitive neurons, such as the Lobula Giant Movement Detector Neuron (LGMD) of the locust?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model (n-ψ) of collision-sensitive neurons with η-like response properties, which assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. We used this model to predict the response characteristics of the LGMD neuron.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the n-ψ model successfully predicts many response characteristics of the LGMD neuron, including its response to objects approaching on a collision course. We found that noise in the inhibitory pathway is critical for obtaining a power law response, while noise in the excitatory pathway has a minimal effect. The model also predicts that threshold smoothing, resulting from integrating many inhibitory inputs, approximates a power law in the inhibitory pathway.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that power law response properties in collision-sensitive neurons, such as the LGMD, may arise from the integration of noisy information channels with response thresholds, rather than from an exact power law scaling of inhibitory input. This has important implications for our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying visual processing in the locust brain.

    **Conclusions:** The n-ψ model provides a biophysically plausible explanation for the power law response properties of collision-sensitive neurons, such as the LGMD. Our results highlight the importance of noise and threshold smoothing in shaping the response characteristics of these neurons, and suggest that power law response properties may be a general feature of visual processing in the locust brain. Further research is needed to explore the broader implications of these findings for our understanding of visual processing and neural computation.
Title: Evolution, Achievements, and Challenges of the National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme in Cameroon: A 14-Year Review (2001-2014)

Abstract:

Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Cameroon, with the first reported cases dating back to 1969. However, institutional control efforts only began in 2002. This review aims to describe the evolution, achievements, and challenges of the National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBUCP) in Cameroon from 2001 to 2014.

Methods: We analyzed collated data on BU cases from 2001 to 2014 and reviewed activity reports from the NBUCP. Case-detection rates and key BU control indicators were calculated and plotted on a time scale to determine trends in performance. A linear regression analysis of BU detection rate from 2005-2014 was conducted to assess the significance of variation.

Results: Over 14 years, 3700 BU cases were notified, with a significant decline in detection rate from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of BU-endemic health districts increased from two to 64, and five diagnostic and treatment centers are operational, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education on BU have gained momentum in Cameroon.

Implications: The NBUCP has made significant progress in case detection and management, health system reinforcement, capacity building, and research. However, the reduction in programme resources and activities by major support partners has led to a decline in performance indicators since 2010.

Conclusions: Despite the challenges, the NBUCP has achieved notable milestones, including a significant reduction in BU detection rates and an increase in the number of endemic health districts. However, the programme faces the major challenge of resource allocation, which must be addressed to sustain and improve control activities. The findings of this review provide valuable insights for scaling up the programme and improving BU control in Cameroon.

    **Title:** Context-Dependent Confidence Biases in Reinforcement Learning

    **Research Question:** Does the valence of decision outcomes (gains or losses) influence confidence judgments in reinforcement learning, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms driving this bias?

    **Methods:** We conducted two experiments in which participants learned stimulus-outcome associations by trial-and-error in a reinforcement-learning task, with outcomes framed as either gains or losses. We measured participants' confidence in their choices and used computational modeling to investigate the underlying mechanisms.

    **Main Findings:** We found that participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected-value of choice options.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that confidence judgments in reinforcement learning are susceptible to context-dependent biases, which can have important functional consequences. Specifically, we show that individuals' learning strategies differ when outcomes are framed as gains or losses, even when performance is equal. This bias can lead to asymmetries in learning and decision-making processes, particularly in volatile environments.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying confidence judgments in reinforcement learning and highlights the importance of considering context-dependent biases in decision-making. The findings have implications for understanding the flexibility of learning and decision-making processes in different contexts, and suggest that confidence can be used as a meta-cognitive variable to enable dynamic comparisons of different learning strategies. Future research should investigate the neural and computational mechanisms underlying these biases and their functional consequences in real-world decision-making scenarios.

    **Title:** Alphavirus nsP3 Interacts with Amphiphysin via SH3 Domain-Mediated Binding to Promote Viral Replication

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) of alphaviruses in viral replication, and how does it interact with host cell proteins to facilitate this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of nsP3 from three alphaviruses (Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, and Chikungunya virus) using biochemical and cell-based assays. We identified a conserved proline-rich sequence motif (PIPPPR) in nsP3 that serves as a target site for the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains of amphiphysin-1 and -2. We also generated mutant viruses with disrupted SH3 binding motifs and used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence amphiphysin-2 expression in infected cells.

    **Main Findings:** We found that nsP3 proteins from all three alphaviruses interacted avidly and in an SH3 binding motif-dependent manner with amphiphysin-1 and -2. Infection of HeLa cells with wild-type virus or a mutant virus with a disrupted SH3 binding motif resulted in impaired viral RNA replication. Moreover, mutations in the SH3 binding motifs of nsP3 led to reduced virus replication in cell culture and attenuated pathogenicity in infected mice.

    **Implications:** These findings establish SH3 domain-mediated binding of nsP3 with amphiphysin as an important host cell interaction that promotes alphavirus replication. The conserved PIPPPR motif in nsP3 serves as a docking site for amphiphysin SH3 domains, and mutations disrupting this interaction impair viral RNA synthesis and replication.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into the role of nsP3 in alphavirus replication and highlight the importance of the nsP3/amphiphysin interaction in promoting viral replication. The identification of the PIPPPR motif as a conserved amphiphysin docking site and the R426E mutation as a useful single amino acid substitution for creating an amphiphysin binding-defective derivative of SINV nsP3 opens up new avenues for the development of antiviral therapies targeting this interaction.

    **Title:** Phylogenetic Analysis of Chromoblastomycosis Agents in Brazil Reveals High Prevalence of Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Novel Species

    **Research Question:** What is the population diversity of chromoblastomycosis agents in Brazil, and which species are most commonly associated with the disease?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 123 clinical strains of chromoblastomycosis agents from different endemic areas in Brazil using sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region, and partial cell division cycle and β-tubulin genes.

    **Main Findings:** Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the studied strains were limited to three clusters within the family Herpotrichiellaceae, which is known to comprise agents of chromoblastomycosis. The Fonsecaea cluster contained the most important agents, with Fonsecaea pedrosoi being the most prevalent (80% of the total set of strains), followed by Fonsecaea monophora (13%), Fonsecaea nubica (3%), and a single isolate of Fonsecaea pugnacius. Additional agents, including two novel species, were located among members of the genera Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the high prevalence of Fonsecaea pedrosoi as the primary agent of chromoblastomycosis in Brazil, followed by Fonsecaea monophora and Fonsecaea nubica. The identification of novel species within the genera Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora expands our understanding of the diversity of chromoblastomycosis agents in Brazil. These findings have significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chromoblastomycosis in this region.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of phylogenetic analysis in understanding the population diversity of chromoblastomycosis agents in Brazil. The high prevalence of Fonsecaea pedrosoi and the identification of novel species highlight the need for further research into the ecology and epidemiology of chromoblastomycosis in this region. Our findings contribute to the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this debilitating disease.

    **Title:** Listeria monocytogenes Subverts the Host DNA Damage Response to Promote Infection

    **Research Question:** How does Listeria monocytogenes manipulate the host DNA damage response (DDR) to facilitate infection?

    **Methods:** In this study, we investigated the effects of Listeria monocytogenes infection on host DNA integrity in vitro and in vivo. We used a combination of molecular and cellular biology techniques, including Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and bacterial infection assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Listeria monocytogenes infection induces DNA breaks in host cells, which activates the DDR. However, the signature response to these breaks is only moderately activated. We discovered that the listerial toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) plays a crucial role in blocking the signaling response to DNA breaks by degrading the sensor protein Mre11. Furthermore, we found that knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in the DDR promotes bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism for the control of infection.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that bacterial dampening of the DDR is critical for a successful Listeria monocytogenes infection. We also demonstrate that the DDR can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection, as deletion or inhibition of DDR proteins leads to higher levels of infection. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial pathogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which Listeria monocytogenes subverts the host DDR to promote infection. By degrading the sensor protein Mre11, LLO blocks the signaling response to DNA breaks, allowing the bacteria to replicate and establish infection. These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between bacteria and host cells and highlight the importance of the DDR in controlling bacterial infection. Our results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Listeria monocytogenes infections.

    **Title:** Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) regulates human herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection by modulating viral gene expression

    **Research Question:** What is the role of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) in human herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and how does the pan-BD domain inhibitor JQ1 enhance HSV infection?

    **Methods:** We screened a chemical library of epigenetic regulation and identified BRD4 as a critical player in HSV infection. We treated cells with the pan-BD domain inhibitor JQ1 and found that it enhanced HSV infection. Using JQ1 as a probe, we demonstrated that JQ1 acts through BRD4 protein, as knockdown of BRD4 expression ablated JQ1's effect on HSV infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that BRD4 regulates HSV replication through complex formation involving CDK9 and RNAP II, and that JQ1 promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating the complex to HSV gene promoters. We also found that suppression of BRD4 expression or inhibition of CDK9 activity impeded HSV infection. Furthermore, transient expression of BRD4 BD1 or BD1/2 domain had a similar effect to that of JQ1 treatment, suggesting that JQ1 enhances HSV infection by switching BRD4 to transcription regulation of viral gene expression from chromatin targeting.

    **Implications:** Our study identifies BRD4 as a modulator of JQ1 action on HSV infection and demonstrates its essential role in HSV infection. These findings have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against HSV infection, as targeting BRD4 or its associated complexes may provide a novel approach to inhibit viral replication.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that BRD4 plays a critical role in HSV infection by regulating viral gene expression, and that JQ1 enhances HSV infection by diverting BRD4 function. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HSV infection and highlight the potential of targeting BRD4 as a therapeutic strategy against HSV infection.
Title: Elucidating the Microbial Ecology of Noma: A Cross-Sectional 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing Study

    Abstract:
    Noma, a devastating oral gangrenous infection, affects over 140,000 malnourished children annually, causing severe facial disfigurement. The etiology of noma remains elusive, with a complex interplay of microbial infection, oral hygiene, and weakened immune system contributing to its development. To investigate the microbial ecology of noma, we conducted a cross-sectional 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing study of gingival fluid samples from 60 children, including 12 healthy controls, 12 children with noma (lesion and healthy sites), and 12 children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) (lesion and healthy sites). Our results show that noma lesions are enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted for Proteobacteria compared to healthy individuals. Notably, samples from healthy sites of diseased mouths had similar proportions of Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that the microbial communities in noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was less abundant in healthy sites from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different. Our study identified several OTUs in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these Orders is associated with the development of noma lesions. These findings have significant implications for understanding the microbial ecology of noma and highlight the need for future longitudinal studies to investigate the viral and microbial components of this community before and early in noma lesion development.

    Research Question:
    What are the microbial communities present in noma lesions and how do they differ from those in healthy individuals and those with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG)?

    Methods:
    We conducted a cross-sectional 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing study of gingival fluid samples from 60 children, including 12 healthy controls, 12 children with noma (lesion and healthy sites), and 12 children with ANG (lesion and healthy sites).

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that noma lesions are enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted for Proteobacteria compared to healthy individuals. We also found that the microbial communities in noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was less abundant in healthy sites from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different.

    Implications:
    These findings have significant implications for understanding the microbial ecology of noma and highlight the need for future longitudinal studies to investigate the viral and microbial components of this community before and early in noma lesion development.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the microbial ecology of noma and identifies several OTUs in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales as indicators of noma. These findings suggest that one or more microbes within these Orders is associated with the development of noma lesions. Future studies should focus on investigating the viral and microbial components of this community before and early in noma lesion development to better understand the etiology of this devastating disease.

    **Title:** NprR, a Bifunctional Regulator of Quorum Sensing in Bacillus thuringiensis, Coordinates Sporulation and Necrotrophism

    **Research Question:** How does the NprR-NprX quorum sensing system regulate sporulation and necrotrophism in Bacillus thuringiensis?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of NprR, a member of the RNPP family, in regulating sporulation and necrotrophism in B. thuringiensis using a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology techniques.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that NprR, in the absence of its cognate signaling peptide NprX, negatively controls sporulation by inhibiting the expression of Spo0A-regulated genes. This inhibition occurs through the prevention of KinA-dependent phosphorylation of Spo0F, thus delaying the initiation of the sporulation process. Furthermore, we found that NprR displays a highly flexible Rap-like structure, suggesting a common inhibition of the sporulation phosphorelay with Rap proteins.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which NprR, a bifunctional regulator, coordinates sporulation and necrotrophism in B. thuringiensis. This coordination ensures the survival and dissemination of the bacteria during host infection. The NprR-NprX regulation system functions as a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system, where NprX is the signaling peptide that switches NprR from a dimeric inhibitor of sporulation to a tetrameric transcriptional activator involved in necrotrophism.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of quorum sensing in B. thuringiensis and highlights the importance of NprR as a key regulator of sporulation and necrotrophism. The conservation of key residues in NprR and Rap proteins suggests a common inhibition of the sporulation phosphorelay, underscoring the evolutionary conservation of this regulatory mechanism across Gram-positive bacteria. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the complex interactions between B. thuringiensis and its insect host, and may inform the development of novel strategies for controlling insect pests.

    **Title:** Predicting Optimal HIV Treatment Regimens using Proteochemometric Models

    **Research Question:** Can proteochemometric models, which combine chemical and protein target properties, improve the prediction of optimal HIV treatment regimens compared to current models based solely on viral genotypic data?

    **Methods:** We developed and validated proteochemometric models using a large-scale clinical database of genotypic and phenotypic information, comprising 300,000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points. Our dataset included 4-9 drugs (NNRTI, NRTI, or PI) and 10,700-27,000 mutants.

    **Main Findings:** Our proteochemometric models achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Fold Change, outperforming previously published sequence-based models in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change (0.76 log units vs. 0.91). We also successfully identified known and novel resistance-conferring mutations of HIV Reverse Transcriptase (e.g., K102Y, T216M) and HIV Protease (e.g., Q18N, N88G). Furthermore, we applied our models prospectively to the public HIV resistance database from Stanford University, achieving a correct resistance prediction rate of 84% on the full set (compared to 80% in previous work on a high-quality subset).

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that proteochemometric models can accurately predict phenotypic resistance based on genotypic data, even for novel mutants and mixtures. By incorporating chemical similarity information, our models provide a more comprehensive understanding of drug-target interactions, enabling the identification of optimal treatment regimens for individual patients.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the potential of proteochemometric modeling in improving HIV treatment outcomes. By integrating chemical and protein target properties, our models can provide more accurate predictions of drug efficacy and resistance, ultimately contributing to the development of personalized treatment strategies for HIV patients. The applicability domain of our models informs users about the reliability of predictions, ensuring that clinicians can make informed decisions about treatment regimens.

    Title: A Pseudopod-Centred Mechanism of Eukaryotic Chemotaxis: A Computational Model and Experimental Validation

    Research Question: What is the underlying mechanism of eukaryotic chemotaxis, and can a pseudopod-based model explain the complex behavior of cells in chemotaxis?

    Methods: We developed a computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudopod autocatalysis, which simulates cell polarization, persistence, and pseudopod selection in response to chemoattractant gradients. We tested the model's explanatory and predictive powers by comparing its output with existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis.

    Main Findings: Our model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, including cell polarization and persistence without stimuli, selection of accurate pseudopods in response to chemoattractant gradients, and bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients. The model also predicts lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients, which was experimentally validated in Dictyostelium cells. Furthermore, the model predicts that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient, which was also experimentally confirmed.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behavior, rather than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants. This implies that the complex behavior of cells in chemotaxis is an emergent property derived from relatively simple pathways.

    Conclusions: Our pseudopod-centred model of chemotaxis provides a new framework for understanding the complex behavior of cells in chemotaxis. The model's ability to reproduce a wide range of experimental data and make novel predictions highlights the importance of considering intrinsic pseudopod behavior in the study of chemotaxis. Future research should focus on understanding the internal dynamics of pseudopod formation and regulation, rather than solely on the external signals and pathways that initiate new actin and pseudopods.

    **Title:** Mechanisms of Early-Phase Transmission of Yersinia pestis by Fleas: The Role of Host Blood and Post-Infection Esophageal Reflux

    **Research Question:** How does the species of rodent blood used for the infectious blood meal affect the mechanism of early-phase transmission (EPT) of Yersinia pestis by fleas, and what is the role of post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER) in this process?

    **Methods:** Fleas were fed bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils, and the location and characteristics of the infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis were assessed 1-3 days after infection.

    **Main Findings:** We observed that 10-28% of two rodent flea species fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood refluxed a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 hours of feeding, a phenomenon we term PIER. In contrast, PIER was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with the accumulation of a dense mixed aggregate of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals that filled the proventriculus. At their next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3-25 times more likely to appear partially blocked, with fresh blood retained within the esophagus, than were fleas without PIER.

    **Implications:** Our data support a model in which EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut and that EPT and BDT can sometimes temporally overlap. The relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and Sciurids and the slower digestion of their blood appears to promote regurgitative transmission, which may be one reason why these rodents are particularly prominent in plague ecology.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of considering the species of rodent blood used for the infectious blood meal in studies of flea transmission of Y. pestis. Our findings suggest that PIER plays a key role in EPT and that the relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of certain rodent species may contribute to the enhanced transmission of Y. pestis by fleas.

    **Title:** Enhancing Coding Performance through Positive Correlations in Neural Populations

    **Research Question:** Can positive correlations among neurons in a population enhance coding performance, and if so, to what extent?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of positive correlations on coding fidelity and capacity in a two-alternative discrimination task using computational models of neural populations.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to previous studies, we found that positive correlations among neurons can significantly enhance coding performance, suppressing discrimination errors by several orders of magnitude and increasing the capacity of the population by more than tenfold. This effect does not require unrealistically high correlation values and can occur in populations with a few tens of neurons. We also demonstrated that heterogeneity in population activity is beneficial for coding performance.

    **Implications:** Our results challenge the conventional view that positive correlations among neurons are detrimental to coding fidelity. Instead, we show that a specific pattern of positive correlation can lead to a "lock-in" of response probabilities, eliminating variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. This pattern, which we refer to as high-fidelity coding, can be achieved through tuning of effective parameters.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that positive correlations among neurons can have a profound impact on coding performance, leading to a massive enhancement in fidelity and capacity. We propose that this effect is a general feature of population coding and suggest experimental tests to identify the specific pattern of positive correlation responsible for high-fidelity coding. Our findings have important implications for understanding the neural basis of perception, cognition, and behavior, and highlight the need for a reevaluation of the role of correlations in neural coding.

    **Title:** Development of an Inaba Serogroup-Specific Conjugate Vaccine against Cholera

    **Research Question:** Can a conjugate vaccine prepared via squaric acid chemistry from the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) component of Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba strain PIC018 and a recombinant heavy chain fragment of tetanus toxin (OSP:rTTHc) induce protective immunity against cholera in mice?

    **Methods:** We assessed a range of vaccine doses (10-50 μg), vaccine compositions varying by molar loading ratio of OSP to rTTHc (3:1, 5:1, 10:1), effect of an adjuvant, and route of immunization (intramuscular or intradermal) in mice.

    **Main Findings:** Immunized mice developed prominent anti-OSP and anti-TT serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses following intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. Intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP occurred following intradermal vaccination. We found comparable immune responses in mice immunized with these variations, although memory B cell and vibriocidal responses were blunted in mice receiving the highest dose of vaccine (50 μg). Administration of OSP:rTTHc resulted in 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model.

    **Implications:** The development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high-level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be beneficial, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. Our findings suggest that the OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine is a promising candidate for further development.

    **Conclusions:** We report the development of an Inaba OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine that induces memory responses and protection against cholera in mice. Our results demonstrate the potential of this vaccine to provide serogroup-specific protection against cholera, a severe watery diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in humans.

    **Title:** Investigating the Cross-Reactivity of Immunochromatographic Card Test (ICT) in Lymphatic Filariasis Mapping: A Cross-Sectional Study in Cameroon

    **Research Question:** Does the Immunochromatographic Card Test (ICT) accurately detect Wuchereria bancrofti infections in areas with contrasting levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans endemicity in Cameroon?

    **Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 villages across three regions of Cameroon to assess the prevalence and intensity of W. bancrofti, L. loa, and M. perstans. Diurnal blood samples were collected from 2190 participants to detect circulating filarial antigen (CFA) by ICT and microfilariae (Mf) using a thick blood smear. Clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis (LF) were also evaluated.

    **Main Findings:** The study found a strong association between ICT positivity and high L. loa Mf intensity, with 21 subjects having more than 8,000 L. loa Mf/ml of blood (Odds ratio = 15.4; 95% CI: 6.1-39.0; p < 0.001). Similarly, a strong positive association was observed between the prevalence of L. loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results found only in areas with an L. loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, no association was found between ICT positivity and M. perstans prevalence or Mf density.

    **Implications:** The study confirms the strong association between ICT positivity and L. loa intensity at the individual level and demonstrates that ICT positivity is strongly associated with high L. loa prevalence. These results suggest that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results is high levels of L. loa.

    **Conclusions:** The findings indicate that W. bancrofti may be less prevalent in the Central African region where L. loa is highly endemic than previously assumed. Accurate re-mapping of the region would be useful for shrinking the map of LF distribution. The study highlights the need for caution when using ICT for LF mapping in areas with high L. loa endemicity and emphasizes the importance of using additional diagnostic procedures to confirm W. bancrofti infections.

    **Title:** Ultrastructural Analysis of Coronavirus-Induced Membrane Alterations Reveals a Unique Reticulovesicular Network for Viral Replication

    **Research Question:** How do positive-strand RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, reorganize host cell membranes to facilitate viral replication?

    **Methods:** We employed electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells to visualize the three-dimensional ultrastructure of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), and "vesicle packets" arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were primarily immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, indicative of viral RNA synthesis, localized to the DMV interior.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the previous assumption that DMVs are isolated vesicles associated with viral RNA synthesis. Instead, our data suggest that DMVs are part of a larger network that reorganizes host cell membranes to facilitate viral replication. This network may also serve to hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms.

    **Conclusions:** Our ultrastructural description of the coronavirus-induced "replication network" provides new insights into the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its interactions with host cells. The integration of biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex with our ultrastructural analysis will aid in further dissecting the mechanisms of viral replication and host-virus interactions. The discovery of a unique reticulovesicular network highlights the complexity of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations and underscores the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of DMV formation and the site of viral RNA synthesis.
Title: Direct Genetic Evidence for the Role of Suberin in Regulating Water and Mineral Ion Uptake and Transport in Arabidopsis thaliana

    Abstract:

    Background: The role of suberin in regulating water and solute transport in plant roots has been a long-standing question in plant biology. Despite its importance, direct genetic evidence supporting the foundational model of suberin as a chemical barrier limiting apoplastic transport of water and solutes has been lacking.

    Research Question: What is the role of suberin in regulating water and mineral ion uptake and transport in Arabidopsis thaliana?

    Methods: We used the newly characterized enhanced suberin1 (esb1) mutant to investigate the relationship between suberin in the root and water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot.

    Main Findings: Esb1 mutants, characterized by increased root suberin, exhibited reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during vegetative growth. These changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn and increases in the accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Se, and Mo in the shoot. Grafting experiments confirmed that these phenotypes were the result of elevated root suberin.

    Implications: Our findings provide direct genetic evidence that suberin in the roots plays a critical role in controlling both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. The changes observed in the elemental accumulation in leaves suggest that a significant component of the radial root transport of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in the apoplast.

    Conclusions: Our results support the standard model that suberin acts as an extracellular transport barrier limiting apoplastic radial transport of water and solutes. Elevated root suberin may represent a novel approach to developing drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of plant water relations and ion transport, and highlight the importance of suberin in regulating these processes.
Title: Dissecting the Sources of Variability in Single Photon Response in Vertebrate Phototransduction

    Abstract:
    The single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction exhibits remarkable reproducibility despite the inherent randomness in the dynamics of R* during its lifetime. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this low variability, we developed a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model that integrates the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. By extracting model parameters from photoresponse data of wild-type and mutant mice with varying numbers of phosphorylation sites, we reproduced both wild-type and mutant responses with the same set of parameters. Our analysis revealed that the randomness of sojourn times in each phosphorylated state is the primary contributor to the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the response, whereas the randomness of the number of R* turnoff steps has a negligible effect. These findings contradict the prevailing view that the larger the number of decay steps of R*, the more stable the photoresponse is. Instead, our results indicate that R* shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of second messengers acts as a variability suppressor. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing the SPR and highlights the importance of considering the stochastic nature of R* dynamics in understanding phototransduction.

**Title:** Decoupling Stochastic Reaction Networks from Extrinsic Fluctuations: A Novel Mathematical Framework

**Research Question:** How can we develop a self-contained stochastic model that summarizes all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of extrinsic fluctuations in a reaction network, allowing for an uncoupled analysis of the network's dynamics?

**Methods:** We propose a general mathematical framework that marginalizes the system dynamics with respect to extrinsic fluctuations, effectively decoupling the network from its dynamic environment. This is achieved by incorporating only the environment's effect onto the network into a new model. We derive the corresponding process- and master equations and demonstrate how stochastic simulations can be performed using this decoupled model.

**Main Findings:** Our approach allows for a significant reduction in computational effort when compared to standard stochastic simulation algorithms (SSA), particularly when the environmental network is costly to simulate. We also show that the uncoupled dynamics provide a novel analytical tool to study how environmental stochasticity is propagated along coupled reaction networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that the total environmental noise splits into two terms: one corresponding to the noise that is suppressed and a second term that quantifies the effective noise sensed by the target network.

**Implications:** Our framework provides a general tool to split stochastic biochemical networks into individual parts that are easier to simulate, facilitating the analysis of complex reaction networks subject to extrinsic fluctuations. This is particularly relevant in the context of gene regulatory networks, where fluctuations in ribosome copy numbers can significantly impact network behavior.

**Conclusions:** We present a novel mathematical framework for decoupling stochastic reaction networks from extrinsic fluctuations, enabling the development of self-contained stochastic models that summarize all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of extrinsic fluctuations. Our approach has significant implications for the analysis of complex biochemical networks and highlights the importance of accounting for extrinsic noise in modeling biological systems.

    **Title:** A Novel Closed-Loop Brain-Machine Interface Training Architecture for Robust Control and Adaptation

    **Research Question:** Can a novel closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMI) training architecture, incorporating an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control (OFC) model and a point process model of spikes, improve the processing time-scale of BMI control and adaptation, and enable robust control across various tasks?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel closed-loop BMI training architecture, termed adaptive optimal feedback-controlled (OFC) point process filter (PPF), which consists of two main computational components: (1) a unified control-theoretic OFC framework for intention estimation and assisted training, and (2) dynamic spike-event-based adaptation. We conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to dissociate the effects of these novel CLDA components.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared to current intention estimation techniques. The OFC assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared to batch-based methods, and was robust to parameter initialization. Furthermore, the architecture extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications towards the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics. The novel CLDA architecture enables robust control and adaptation at the time-scale of spike events, allowing for faster and more consistent performance convergence. The unified control-theoretic OFC framework provides a general and systematic approach to CLDA, enabling intention estimation, assisted training, and adaptation across diverse BMI setups.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the novel closed-loop BMI training architecture in improving the processing time-scale of BMI control and adaptation, and enabling robust control across various tasks. The adaptive OFC-PPF model provides a unified and general control-theoretic CLDA framework, which has significant implications for the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.

    **Title:** Redundancy and Correlation in Retinal Responses to Structured Stimuli

    **Research Question:** How does the mammalian retina process and respond to stimuli with varying degrees of spatial and temporal correlations?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effect of stimulus structure on redundancy in the retina by measuring simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells presented with natural and artificial stimuli that varied greatly in correlation structure. The stimuli and recordings are publicly available online.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that responding to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, such as natural movies, pairs of ganglion cells were modestly more correlated than in response to white noise checkerboards. However, they were much less correlated than predicted by a non-adapting functional model of retinal response. In contrast, responding to stimuli with purely spatial correlations, pairs of ganglion cells showed increased correlations consistent with a static, non-adapting receptive field and nonlinearity. We also found that ganglion cells had faster temporal kernels and tended to have stronger surrounds in response to spatio-temporally correlated stimuli.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the retina maintains a moderate level of output correlation across a wide range of spatio-temporally correlated stimuli, ranging from white noise checkerboards to natural movies. The amount of output correlation varies between stimuli, but the changes are much less than predicted by a non-adapting linear-nonlinear functional model.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the mammalian retina does not fully decorrelate its input, even for the least correlated white noise checkerboard stimuli. Instead, some correlations are present between pairs of retinal ganglion cell spike trains. The gain of retinal ganglion cells responding to correlated stimuli changes with "effective contrast," and the retina may dynamically adjust its coding strategy to represent the new stimulus class efficiently. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how the retina processes and encodes visual information.
Title: Predicting Synthetic Lethal Interactions in Yeast: An Integrative, Multi-Network Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: Synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, where a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype, are crucial for understanding functional redundancy, dissecting protein complexes, and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases. However, only a small proportion of gene pairs have been tested for SL interactions due to the vast number of possible combinations.

    Research Question: Can an integrative, multi-network approach improve the prediction of SL interactions in yeast?

    Methods: We developed a novel framework, Multi-Network and Multi-Classifier (MNMC), which combines a large number of features from various data sources to characterize relationships between gene pairs. These features are independent of known SL interactions, unlike previous approaches. We used a non-parametric multi-classifier system to predict SL interactions, enabling the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures.

    Main Findings: Our comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the SL-independent features, in conjunction with the advanced classification scheme, led to improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method. We derived the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, which was well-supported by literature. Furthermore, we predicted SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast, available at http://sage.fhcrc.org/downloads/downloads/predicted_yeast_genetic_interactions.zip.

    Implications: This integrative approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and higher organisms, such as mouse and human, where very few genetic interactions have been identified to date.

    Conclusions: Our MNMC framework significantly improves the prediction of SL interactions in yeast by leveraging a large number of features and an advanced classification scheme. This approach has the potential to accelerate the discovery of genetic interactions in complex organisms, shedding light on the mechanistic underpinnings of human diseases and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    **Title:** The BRCA Challenge: A Global Initiative for Sharing and Collaborative Annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Variants

    **Research Question:** How can the aggregation and sharing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 data facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk?

    **Methods:** The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data from public and clinical databases, including the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). The data set comprises over 20,000 variants, three times the number found in the next-largest public database, with approximately 7,250 expert classifications.

    **Main Findings:** The BRCA Challenge has brought together an international consortium of expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. The project has developed an open-access web portal, the BRCA Exchange (www.brcaexchange.org), which provides a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers to encourage data sharing, development of methods for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

    **Implications:** The BRCA Challenge represents an important step in the sharing and collaborative annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants to advance human health globally. The project pioneers the hypothesis-free linkage of molecular variants with electronic patient records to build an unbiased prospective knowledge base of cancer predisposition.

    **Conclusions:** The BRCA Challenge serves as a demonstration project to bring together clinicians, researchers, data scientists, patients, and advocates to work toward a new model of data sharing. By aggregating and sharing BRCA1 and BRCA2 data, the project aims to improve the precision of variant interpretation, enabling clinicians and patients to make informed decisions together. The BRCA Challenge has delivered a solution to improve data sharing and variant classification in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, ultimately improving clinical care for clinicians, patients, and their families.

    Title: Unveiling the Redox Landscape of Plasmodium falciparum: A Comprehensive Map of Antioxidant and Redox Regulatory Proteins

    Research Question: What is the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins in Plasmodium falciparum, and how do these proteins contribute to the parasite's redox balance and pathogenicity?

    Methods: We employed a systematic approach to study the subcellular localization of redox-related proteins in Plasmodium falciparum using a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical, and microscopy techniques.

    Main Findings: Our study provides the first complete map of redox compartmentation in Plasmodium falciparum, revealing the targeting of two plasmodial peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. We also obtained a comprehensive picture of the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins. Notably, Plasmodium utilizes alternative translation initiation (ATI) to achieve differential targeting of two major antioxidant redox-enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.

    Implications: Our findings have significant implications for the development of chemotherapeutic agents that target the redox equilibrium of Plasmodium. The apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid, harbors indispensable plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty-acid and haem biosynthesis. The absence of major antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, in the parasite offers great potential for the development of chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt the redox balance of Plasmodium.

    Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the subcellular localization of redox-related proteins in Plasmodium falciparum, shedding light on the parasite's redox balance and pathogenicity. The discovery of ATI in apicomplexan parasites opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention, highlighting the potential for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents that target the redox equilibrium of Plasmodium.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Electrostatic Interactions in the Coupled Folding and Binding Process of PUMA and Mcl-1

    Abstract:

    Background: PUMA, a member of the BH3-only protein family, is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that binds to its cellular partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif. The binding process involves a coupled folding and binding mechanism, where the BH3 motif folds into an α-helix upon binding to Mcl-1.

    Research Question: What is the role of electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding process of PUMA and Mcl-1?

    Methods: We employed a structure-based coarse-grained model with an explicit Debye-Hückel charge model to investigate the importance of electrostatic interactions in the early and later stages of the binding process. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity, and shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength.

    Main Findings: Our results indicate that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have a marginal influence on the unbound states of PUMA. In contrast, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, play a crucial role in the formation of the initial encounter complex. Our simulations reveal that the binding process is accelerated by electrostatic interactions, with attractive forces dominating the association rates. Furthermore, we observed that association rates decrease at higher ionic strengths, where charges are more efficiently screened from each other and electrostatic interactions are weakened.

    Implications: Our findings highlight the importance of electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding process of PUMA and Mcl-1. The results suggest that non-native electrostatic interactions are involved in the formation of the initial encounter complex, which is a critical step in the binding process. These findings have implications for understanding the binding reactions of IDPs and could be used to provide predictions for the results of mutational studies.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the role of electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding process of PUMA and Mcl-1. The use of a structure-based coarse-grained model allowed us to reveal the binding mechanism in more detail than is possible using experimental data alone. Our results demonstrate the importance of non-native electrostatic interactions in the binding process and highlight the potential importance of such interactions for describing the binding reactions of IDPs.

    **Title:** Nuclear Dynamics of Polycomb Group Proteins and Chromatin Domains during Drosophila Embryogenesis

    **Research Question:** How do Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and chromatin domains interact and move within the nucleus during Drosophila embryogenesis?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins to study the formation and mobility of Polycomb (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH) bodies in Drosophila embryos.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that PC bodies correspond to 3D structural counterparts of linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis reveals two types of motion influencing the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains: long-range motions corresponding to the movement of whole chromosome territories and fast, highly constrained motions within smaller volumes. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains decreases in late developmental stages, suggesting a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics to the maintenance of stable gene silencing.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the nuclear organization and dynamics of PcG proteins and chromatin domains during Drosophila embryogenesis. The buffering of environmental effects, such as temperature change, by Polycomb proteins may be an important determinant of the stability of Polycomb-dependent gene silencing during development.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that PC bodies are the nuclear counterparts of linear genomic domains and that their formation and motion are influenced by developmental processes. The dynamics of PC bodies and chromatin domains may play a crucial role in the maintenance of stable gene silencing during Drosophila embryogenesis. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between chromatin organization and gene regulation during development.

    **Title:** Ultra-Deep Sequencing Reveals Replication Errors as the Primary Cause of Somatic mtDNA Mutations in Aging Mice

    **Research Question:** What is the primary mechanism underlying the accumulation of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in aging mice?

    **Methods:** We employed ultra-deep sequencing to investigate genome-wide mtDNA mutation loads in the livers of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. Specifically, we analyzed mtDNA from mice homozygous for an allele expressing a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mtDNA mutator mice) and their wildtype siblings.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mtDNA mutator mice exhibit a 10-fold higher point mutation load compared to their wildtype siblings. Furthermore, these mice display increased levels of truncated linear mtDNA molecules, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occur at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and do not contribute to the premature aging phenotype. Sequence analysis revealed that the majority of mutations in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings are inherited from their heterozygous mothers, consistent with germline transmission. Notably, we found no increase in point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, questioning the causative role of these changes in aging.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development, rather than resulting from damage accumulation in adult life. This challenges the prevailing view that oxidative damage is a major cause of mtDNA mutations. Furthermore, our results indicate that circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions are unlikely to be the driving force behind the premature aging phenotype in mtDNA mutator mice.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying mtDNA mutations in aging mice, highlighting the importance of replication errors during development as the primary cause of somatic mtDNA mutations. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the aging process and the role of mtDNA mutations in age-related diseases. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the physiological consequences of linear mtDNA molecules and their contribution to premature aging in mtDNA mutator mice.

    **Title:** Fusobacterium nucleatum F1Fo-ATP Synthase Utilizes a Novel Na+ Recognition Motif for ATP Synthesis

    **Research Question:** How does the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+ and couple it to ATP synthesis?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular modeling, free-energy simulations, activity measurements, and X-ray crystallography to investigate the F1Fo-ATP synthase from F. nucleatum. We created a structural model of the c-ring using homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, and solved two identical crystal structures of the c11 ring at 2.2 and 2.6 Å resolution.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that F. nucleatum F1Fo-ATP synthase uses a novel Na+ recognition motif to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+, which is directly coupled to ATP synthesis. The c-ring features two glutamate residues in each of its 11 ion-binding sites, instead of a single carboxylate side-chain. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Activity measurements showed Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. Furthermore, Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide definitive evidence of Na+ coupling in F. nucleatum F1Fo-ATP synthase and reveal a new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the mechanism of ion transport and the specificity of the enzyme. Moreover, it provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that F. nucleatum F1Fo-ATP synthase utilizes a novel Na+ recognition motif to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+, which is directly coupled to ATP synthesis. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of ion transport and the specificity of the enzyme, and provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.

    **Title:** In Vivo T Cell Responses to TCR/pMHC Interactions: A Paradigm Shift in Vaccine Design

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between T cell receptor (TCR)/major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) interaction parameters and T cell responses in vivo?

    **Methods:** We investigated the influence of TCR/pMHC binding characteristics on in vivo T cell immunity by tracking CD4+ T cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro T cell activation potencies.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to predictions from in vitro studies, we found that optimal in vivo T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives. The ligand with the longest TCR/pMHC half-life exhibited diminished in vivo responses, associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over a broad range of time points.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not recapitulated in in vitro assays, highlighting the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands as part of vaccine design. The commonly held assumption that more potent T cell responses result from higher-avidity TCR recognition and longer-lived TCR/pMHC interactions during T cell recognition may need to be reconsidered.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the relationship between TCR/pMHC interaction parameters and T cell responses in vivo is more complex than previously thought. The optimal in vivo T cell response occurs to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives, suggesting that vaccination strategies that aim to elicit maximum-avidity TCR recognition with engineered peptide ligands may not be the most effective approach. Our findings have significant implications for the design of vaccines and immunotherapies, emphasizing the need to consider in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands in addition to in vitro potency.

    **Title:** Genome Analysis of Nectria haematococca Mating Population VI Reveals Gene Expansion and Supernumerary Chromosomes Contributing to Ecological Diversification

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic factors contributing to the ecological diversification of Nectria haematococca Mating Population VI (MPVI), a member of the Fusarium solani species complex?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the genome of N. haematococca MPVI isolate 77-13-4 using optical mapping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and bioinformatics tools to determine its chromosomal structure and gene content.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that N. haematococca MPVI has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a physical genome size of 54.43 Mb, making it one of the largest ascomycete genomes reported to date. We identified two classes of genes contributing to gene expansion: (1) specific genes not found in other fungi, including its closest sequenced relative, Fusarium graminearum, and (2) genes present in multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI but as single copies in other fungi. Some of these additional genes appear to have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. We also confirmed the supernumerary nature of chromosomes 14, 15, and 17, which contain more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content compared to other chromosomes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the gene expansion and large genome size of N. haematococca MPVI are consistent with its diverse range of habitats. The presence of unique genes on supernumerary chromosomes may account for individual isolates having different environmental niches. This study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic factors contributing to ecological diversification in fungi and has implications for understanding the evolution of fungal pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of ecological diversification in N. haematococca MPVI, a member of the Fusarium solani species complex. Our results demonstrate the importance of supernumerary chromosomes and gene expansion in contributing to the species' ability to colonize diverse environments. Further research is needed to determine the origin of the extra genes and supernumerary chromosomes in N. haematococca MPVI and to compare the sizes and organization of its genome to other species within the F. solani species complex.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanisms of Alpha Herpesvirus Egress: A Live-Cell Fluorescence Microscopy Study of Pseudorabies Virus (PRV) Transport and Exocytosis

    Abstract:
    The egress of newly assembled herpesvirus particles from infected cells is a complex process involving the host secretory pathway and viral components. To elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress, we developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus (PRV) particles in non-polarized epithelial cells. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we selectively imaged fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and employed a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis. Our results reveal that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles, which are tightly regulated by Rab GTPases, including Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is frequently associated with patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. Membrane fusion occurs at the site of exocytosis, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress and proposes an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.

    Research Question:
    What are the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress in non-polarized epithelial cells?

    Methods:
    We developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method using TIRF microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and employed a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis. We performed single-particle tracking and mean squared displacement analysis to characterize particle motion and imaged a panel of cellular proteins to identify those spatially and dynamically associated with viral exocytosis.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles, which are tightly regulated by Rab GTPases, including Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is frequently associated with patches of LL5β. Membrane fusion occurs at the site of exocytosis, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface.

    Implications:
    Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress and proposes an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress. These findings have important implications for understanding the biology of herpesvirus infection and the development of antiviral therapies.

    Conclusions:
    Our live-cell fluorescence microscopy study provides a detailed understanding of the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress in non-polarized epithelial cells. The results of this study will contribute to the development of new antiviral therapies and a deeper understanding of the biology of herpesvirus infection.

**Title:** Enterobiasis and Mebendazole Treatment Modulate Intestinal Microbiota and Immune Responses in Primary School Children

**Research Question:** Does exposure to Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) and mebendazole treatment alter the intestinal microbial composition and immune responses in primary school children?

**Methods:** We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 109 primary school children (30 pinworm-negative and 79 pinworm-infected) in Taichung, Taiwan. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and 2 weeks after administration of 100 mg mebendazole in pinworm-infected individuals. Gut microbiota diversity, intestinal cytokine, and secretory IgA (SIgA) levels were analyzed.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that pinworm infection increased gut microbiota diversity, which peaked after mebendazole treatment. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment were associated with a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria and an increased proportion of Actinobacteria. Notably, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment. Intestinal SIgA levels were lower in the pinworm-infected group, but elevated in half of the mebendazole-treated group. A higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole deworming treatment.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole treatment is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria, including the probiotic Bifidobacterium, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria. The gut SIgA level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, but increased in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on intestinal microbiota and immune responses in primary school children. Our results highlight the complex interactions between pinworm, microbiota, and host immune responses, suggesting that the net immunomodulatory effect of pinworm may be dependent on its interaction with the individual's intestinal microbiota. Further studies, including animal experiments, are needed to elucidate the causal relationships between pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment on gut microbial composition and host immune responses.

    **Title:** Uncovering Epistatic Loci Underlying Complex Traits: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Arabidopsis thaliana Root Length

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic architecture underlying the complex trait of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana, and how do epistatic interactions contribute to the genetic variance of this trait?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWA) of root length in a population of wild-collected Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, using both additive and epistatic models to identify loci contributing to the genetic variance of this trait.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to the common assumption that most genetic variance is additive, we found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for root length in the examined population was statistically zero. However, the broad-sense heritability was significantly larger, primarily due to epistasis. Using epistatic GWA analysis, we identified four interacting pairs of loci involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a standard multiple-testing corrected significance threshold. These loci were not detected in the additive GWA analysis due to epistasis that cancelled out the additive genetic variance.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for epistatic interactions in GWA studies of complex traits. The low additive genetic variance captured by the genome-wide genotypes explains why no associations to root length could be found using standard additive-model-based GWA approaches. Our results also suggest that small population sizes can increase the risk of identifying false epistatic interactions.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that epistatic GWA analysis is essential for identifying loci contributing to the genetic variance of complex traits, such as root length in Arabidopsis thaliana. By accounting for epistatic interactions, we identified seven loci involved in four unique epistatically interacting pairs of loci that together explained a large fraction of the phenotypic variance in the population. Our findings have important implications for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and highlight the need to utilize GWA analysis methods that account for both additive and non-additive genetic variance.

    **Title:** Mitochondrial DNA Haplogroups and Disease-Causing Mutations: A Global Analysis of 30,506 Sequences

    **Background:** Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been identified as a common cause of human disease, with multiple occurrences in the global population. However, the relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and disease-causing mutations is not well understood.

    **Research Question:** Do mtDNA haplogroups influence the likelihood of acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 30,506 mtDNA sequences from a global dataset to determine the characteristics of disease-causing mutations and their association with mtDNA haplogroups.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the mean pathogenicity score for known disease-causing mutations was significantly different between mtDNA macro-haplogroups. We observed that several mutations were present across all haplogroup backgrounds, while others were restricted to specific clades. Sequence diversity estimates showed that disease-causing mutations were more frequent on young sequences, and genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that mtDNA haplogroups play a role in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations. This provides an explanation for the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that mtDNA haplogroups are associated with the likelihood of acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations. We found that 10 (29.4%) of the 34 recurrent disease-causing mtDNA mutations showed statistical evidence of haplogroup clustering after correcting for sample size. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and disease-causing mutations, and highlight the need for further research into the role of mtDNA haplogroups in human disease.

    **Supporting Text:** Our analysis of 30,506 human mtDNA sequences shows that the association between disease-causing mtDNA mutations and background mtDNA haplogroups is not limited to three disease-causing mtDNA mutations known to cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Instead, we found that several disease-causing mutations were present across all haplogroup backgrounds, while others were restricted to specific clades. These findings provide new insights into the complex relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and disease-causing mutations.

    **Title:** Modeling Collective Cell Motility: Unraveling the Dynamics of Cell-Cell Interactions in Cancer Metastasis, Embryonic Development, and Wound Healing

    **Research Question:** How do cell-cell interactions, including contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), govern the collective motility of cells in cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational phase field model of collective cell motility that incorporates the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for CIL. We used this model to simulate two-cell collisions on micropatterned substrates, which restrict cell migration to linear, quasi-one-dimensional paths.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that a subtle balance between internal cell polarization, CIL, and cell-cell adhesion governs the outcome of cell-cell collisions. We identified the parameters that control transitions between different collision outcomes, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These parameters suggest hypotheses for why different cell types exhibit distinct collision behavior and the effects of interventions that modulate collision outcomes.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating biochemical interactions, such as CIL and cell contact dynamics, into models of collective cell migration. We show that these interactions can lead to unintuitive behaviors, such as nonmonotonic effects of adhesion, which would not arise in simplified models. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing, where collective cell migration plays a crucial role.

    **Conclusions:** By combining detailed cell shape dynamics with biochemical interactions, our model reproduces the heterogeneity in cell-cell collision outcomes observed experimentally in neural crest cells. Our results highlight the importance of complementing minimal models of cells as self-propelled particles with increasingly detailed models for cell shape and mechanics. This work provides new insights into the complex dynamics of cell-cell interactions and has the potential to inform the development of interventions that modulate collective cell migration in various biological contexts.
Title: Elucidating the Dissociation Mechanism of Thioredoxin (Trx) Mixed Disulfide Complexes: A Multidisciplinary Approach

    Abstract:
    The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes has been a topic of debate for over two decades. To resolve this controversy, we employed a multidisciplinary approach combining theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants to investigate the dissociation of the Trx-ArsC complex. Our results reveal that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, activating it for nucleophilic attack. We found that Cys32Trx is more reactive than Cys82ArsC and directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx, rather than Cys89ArsC. This study provides fresh insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism, resulting in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx.

    Research Question:
    What is the dissociation mechanism of Trx mixed disulfide complexes, specifically the Trx-ArsC complex?

    Methods:
    We employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants to investigate the dissociation of the Trx-ArsC complex.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, activating it for nucleophilic attack. We found that Cys32Trx is more reactive than Cys82ArsC and directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx, rather than Cys89ArsC.

    Implications:
    This study provides fresh insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism, resulting in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the role of Trx in redox reactions and its potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our multidisciplinary approach has elucidated the dissociation mechanism of Trx mixed disulfide complexes, resolving a long-standing controversy in the field. Our results demonstrate that Cys32Trx is the primary nucleophile responsible for the dissociation of the Trx-ArsC complex, and its nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx leads to the formation of reduced substrate and oxidized Trx.

    **Title:** Bayesian Updating of Taste Preferences in Young Adults: Evidence for Uncertainty and Social Influence

    **Research Question:** Do young adults exhibit uncertainty in their taste preferences, and do they update their preferences based on social information through Bayesian reasoning?

    **Methods:** We conducted a large-scale community study of 14-24 year olds (n > 700) to examine discounting preferences, including decision variability, before and after participants observed another person's choices. We used a novel taste-uncertainty (KU) model to capture subjects' uncertainty about their own tastes and update their preferences based on social information.

    **Main Findings:** Our results provide strong evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian taste updating. First, participants displayed decision variability that was better accounted for by a random-taste model than by a response-noise model. Second, apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model taking into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. We found that the degree of taste change correlated with participants' choice variability, suggesting that choice variability reflects uncertain taste rather than just 'trembling hand' or taste-independent response noise.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental research. They suggest that taste preferences are not fixed personality characteristics, but rather uncertain beliefs that can be updated based on social information. This has important implications for our understanding of decision-making, impulsivity, and social influence in young adults.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides novel evidence for the Bayesian updating of taste preferences in young adults. We show that uncertainty about one's own preferences, reflected in behavioural variability in the absence of social influence, is an important basis for a subsequent preference shift. Our findings support the idea that people can learn about their own tastes by considering evidence, such as the preferences of relevant others, and then performing Bayesian updating. These results have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and social influence in young adults.

Title: Systems-Level Coordination of Filamentous Growth Regulation in Budding Yeast

Background: Filamentous growth in budding yeast is a complex differentiation response that occurs under specific environmental conditions, regulated by multiple signaling pathways. However, the integration of information from these pathways into a highly coordinated response remains poorly understood.

Research Question: How do different signaling pathways integrate to regulate filamentous growth in budding yeast?

Methods: We employed a novel screening approach, secretion profiling, to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, the signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth (FG) MAPK pathway. We used complementary genomic collections to identify new regulators of the FG pathway.

Main Findings: Our results show that many of the pathways that regulate filamentous growth (RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG) are also required for FG pathway activation. This regulation sensitizes the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizes it with the global signaling network. Several regulators are required for MSB2 expression, identifying the MSB2 promoter as a target "hub" where multiple signals converge. Accessibility to the MSB2 promoter is further regulated by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3p(L), which positively regulates FG pathway activity and filamentous growth.

Implications: Our findings provide the first glimpse of a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth. Systems-level integration of signaling circuitry is likely to coordinate other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors.

Conclusions: Our study reveals that the pathways that control filamentous growth are connected in co-regulatory circuits, indicating a systems-level coordination of this differentiation response. The connections between the RIM101, OPI1, and RTG pathways to FG pathway regulation are entirely novel, and the RAS pathway and several other pathways converge on the promoter of the key upstream regulator (MSB2) of the FG pathway. These findings highlight the complexity of filamentous growth regulation and the need for a systems-level understanding of this process.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Evolution of Fruiting Body Morphology in Fungi: A Genome-Wide Gene Expression Study

    **Research Question:** How do changes in gene expression contribute to the evolution of divergent morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically in the Sordariomycetes clade?

    **Methods:** We cultured five species of Sordariomycetes fungi in a common garden environment and profiled genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. We reconstructed ancestral gene expression phenotypes and identified genes with the largest evolved increases in gene expression across development. We then conducted knockouts and performed phenotypic analysis in two divergent species to investigate the functional significance of these genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that few developmental genes whose expression evolves retain common phenotypes or even phenotypes corresponding to a common stage of development. However, numerous genes retain some function within the larger fruiting body developmental process. We identified key genes involved in sexual development and their lability in the network regulating fungal sexual reproduction. Our results suggest that changes in gene expression are a key driver of morphological innovation in fungi.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of developmental processes in multicellular organisms. By combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes, we were able to refine Bayesian networks of the genes underlying fruiting body development. This approach provides a more rigorous understanding of the relationships among genes important to a certain morphological process and how those relationships evolved.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of an evolutionary approach to identifying relevant genes and understanding the evolution of developmental processes. By mapping differential variational properties associated with developmental processes, we can gain insights into how and why developmental evolution occurs the way it does. Our results highlight the importance of gene regulation and expression in the evolution of complex phenotypes and provide a framework for understanding the evolution of morphological innovation in fungi and other organisms.

    Title: Efficient Delivery of Transgenes into Schistosome Eggs using Square Wave Electroporation

    Research Question: Can square wave electroporation be used to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules into the eggs of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm responsible for schistosomiasis?

    Methods: Schistosome eggs were incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square wave electroporation, and fluorescence microscopy was used to detect Cy3-signals in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Additionally, electroporation was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs, and luciferase activity was detected three hours later. Schistosome eggs were also exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), and proviral transgenes were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs.

    Main Findings: The results showed that square wave electroporation facilitated the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome egg, with electroporation being more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped MLV than simply soaking the eggs in virions. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that electroporation of virions resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in these schistosomes compared to soaking alone. Furthermore, relative qPCR indicated a copy number for the proviral luciferase transgene of ∼20 copies for 100 copies of a representative single copy endogenous gene (encoding cathepsin D).

    Implications: These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis, which could lead to the development of novel strategies for controlling schistosomiasis. The ability to efficiently deliver transgenes into the eggs of S. mansoni using square wave electroporation has significant implications for the study of schistosome biology and the development of new treatments for schistosomiasis.

    Conclusions: Square wave electroporation is a powerful tool for delivering transgenes and other macromolecules into the eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. The results of this study demonstrate that electroporation is more efficient than soaking alone for transduction of schistosome eggs by messenger RNA encoding luciferase and by pseudotyped retrovirus virions. These findings have important implications for the study of schistosome biology and the development of new treatments for schistosomiasis.

    **Title:** Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) Model Reveals Dynamic Properties of Large Macromolecular Assemblies

    **Research Question:** How do large macromolecular assemblies respond dynamically to signal perturbations, and what are the key residues involved in signal transmission and binding interactions?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel approach, Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model, to study the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. This model involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation and monitoring the time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously using a Krylov subspace projection method. We applied this approach to the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, a large macromolecular machinery.

    **Main Findings:** Our PMT model revealed rich information on the dynamic behavior of the GroEL-GroES system, including the identification of pivot residues important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues key to signal mediation, and anchor residues crucial for binding interactions. We found that our predictions had an accuracy of 71-84% when compared to independent experimental studies.

    **Implications:** The PMT model provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies, enabling the characterization of functionally important residues and the mechanism of signal transduction. This approach can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries, such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex, to gain insights into their dynamic behavior and function.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the PMT model in revealing the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. By monitoring the time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously, we can identify key residues involved in signal transmission and binding interactions. The PMT model has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the dynamic behavior of large macromolecular assemblies and their roles in cellular processes. Further applications of this approach will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of signal transduction and protein function, ultimately contributing to the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to protein misfolding and aggregation.

    **Title:** Fungal Galectin-Mediated Nematotoxicity: Unveiling a Novel Defense Mechanism in Fungi

    **Research Question:** What is the physiological role of fungal galectins, and do they play a role in the defense of fungi against predators?

    **Methods:** We investigated the nematotoxic activity of a mushroom galectin, Coprinopsis cinerea CGL2, in Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetically tractable model nematode. We fed C. elegans with E. coli cells expressing CGL2 or a carbohydrate-binding defective variant, CGL2 (W72G), and observed the effects on nematode development, reproduction, and survival.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CGL2 feeding inhibited C. elegans development and reproduction, ultimately leading to nematode death. The lack of toxicity of the CGL2 variant and the resistance of a C. elegans mutant defective in GDP-fucose biosynthesis suggest that CGL2-mediated nematotoxicity depends on the interaction between the galectin and a fucose-containing glycoconjugate. A screen for CGL2-resistant worm mutants identified the glycoconjugate as a Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that fungal galectins, such as CGL2, play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific glycoconjugates of these organisms. The identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope may shed light on the physiological significance of this N-glycan modification.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for a novel defense mechanism in fungi, where fungal galectins interact with specific glycoconjugates of predators, such as nematodes, to inhibit their development and reproduction. The identification of the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores as the ligand of CGL2 highlights the importance of glycosylation in nematode-fungal interactions. These findings have implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between fungi and their predators, and may lead to the development of novel strategies for controlling fungal pathogens.

    **Title:** The Latent Reservoir: A Hidden Driver of HIV Evolutionary Dynamics

    **Research Question:** How does the presence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells affect the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within individuals and at the population level?

    **Methods:** We developed a within-host quasispecies model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4+ T cells and nested it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. We used biologically plausible parameter values to simulate the effects of the reservoir on within-host and between-host evolutionary dynamics.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the presence of a latent reservoir can severely delay evolutionary dynamics within a single host, with longer delays associated with larger relative reservoir sizes and/or homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. This delay can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale, allowing the virus to evolve intermediate viral loads consistent with maximizing transmission, rather than the very high viral loads predicted by previous models.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the latent reservoir plays a crucial role in both within- and between-host viral evolution. The delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate levels of virulence that optimize transmission at the population level. This has important implications for our understanding of HIV evolution and transmission dynamics.

    **Conclusions:** We argue that the latent reservoir has important, and hitherto under-appreciated, roles in both within- and between-host viral evolution. The presence of a latent reservoir can significantly impact the evolutionary dynamics of HIV, leading to the evolution of intermediate levels of virulence that maximize transmission. Our results highlight the need to consider the role of the latent reservoir in HIV evolution and transmission dynamics, and suggest that targeting the reservoir may be a critical component of HIV cure strategies.
Title: Coxsackievirus B3 Evades CD8+ T Cell Immunity by Inhibiting MHC Class I Antigen Presentation

    Abstract:
    Background: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a common cause of viral infections, but the mechanisms by which it evades the host T cell response are not fully understood.

    Research Question: How does CVB3 evade CD8+ T cell immunity and induce CD4+ T cell responses?

    Methods: We employed transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors to evaluate in vitro and in vivo antigen presentation by CVB3. We constructed recombinant CVB3 encoding well-characterized CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cell epitopes from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).

    Main Findings: Our results show that CVB3 almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via the MHC class I pathway, thereby evading CD8+ T cell immunity. In contrast, the presentation of CVB3-encoded MHC class II epitopes is relatively unencumbered, and CVB3 induces in vivo CD4+ T cell responses that are phenotypically normal, displaying an effector phenotype and maturing into multi-functional CVB3-specific memory CD4+ T cells.

    Implications: Our findings have significant implications for the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during coxsackievirus infection. The ability of CVB3 to inhibit MHC class I antigen presentation provides a plausible explanation for the weakness of the primary CD8+ T cell response.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that CVB3 evades CD8+ T cell immunity by inhibiting MHC class I antigen presentation, while inducing CD4+ T cell responses that are phenotypically normal. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which viruses evade the host T cell response and have implications for the development of effective therapeutic strategies against coxsackievirus infections.
Title: Investigating the Efficacy of High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone in Treating Leprosy Type 1 Reactions and Nerve Function Impairment

    Abstract:
    Leprosy Type 1 reactions (T1Rs) are a major cause of nerve damage and preventable disability in leprosy patients. The standard treatment for T1Rs involves oral corticosteroids, but the optimal dose and duration of treatment remain unclear. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of three days of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g) at the start of prednisolone therapy in T1Rs and nerve function impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomly assigned to receive methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone (n = 20) or oral prednisolone alone (n = 22). The results showed that individuals treated with methylprednisolone were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study compared to those treated with prednisolone alone. However, there were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. Notably, 50% of individuals with T1Rs and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids. These findings support the use of more prolonged courses of corticosteroids to treat T1Rs and highlight the need for further investigation into risk factors for recurrence of T1Rs and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.

    Methods:
    This randomized controlled trial involved 42 individuals with T1Rs and/or nerve function impairment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either three days of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g) followed by oral prednisolone (n = 20) or oral prednisolone alone (n = 22). The primary outcome measure was the rate of deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study.

    Main Findings:
    The results showed that individuals treated with methylprednisolone were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study compared to those treated with prednisolone alone. However, there were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. Notably, 50% of individuals with T1Rs and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids.

    Implications:
    These findings support the use of more prolonged courses of corticosteroids to treat T1Rs and highlight the need for further investigation into risk factors for recurrence of T1Rs and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment. The results also suggest that high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone may be a safe and effective treatment option for T1Rs and nerve function impairment.

    Conclusions:
    This randomized controlled trial provides evidence for the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in treating T1Rs and nerve function impairment. The results suggest that more prolonged courses of corticosteroids may be necessary to prevent recurrence of T1Rs and nerve function impairment. Further research is needed to investigate the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment for T1Rs and to identify risk factors for recurrence of T1Rs and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.
Title: Impaired Regulatory T Cell Function in Chronic HIV Infection Contributes to Exhaustion of HIV-Specific CD8 T Cell Responses

    Abstract:

    Background: Regulatory CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells (Treg) play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between effector and memory CD8+ T cells in HIV-negative settings. However, the effects of Treg on CD8 responses in chronic HIV infection are not well understood.

    Research Question: Do Treg from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV+) exert similar suppressive effects on CD8+ T cells as Treg from HIV-negative controls (Treg/HIV-), and do these effects contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific CD8 T cell responses?

    Methods: We investigated the suppressive effects of Treg/HIV+ and Treg/HIV- on autologous CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients in co-culture experiments. We also analyzed the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on HIV-specific and recall antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.

    Main Findings: Our results show that Treg/HIV+ did not significantly inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function, indicating a defect in the suppressive capacity of Treg/HIV+ or a lack of sensitivity of effector T cells in HIV infection. However, Treg/HIV+ inhibited the IFN-γ expression of autologous CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, Treg/HIV- inhibited the differentiation of both CEF- and Gag-specific CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients. The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was higher on Gag-specific CD8+ T cells compared to CEF-specific CD8+ T cells, and did not change significantly after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg/HIV-.

    Implications: Our results suggest that Treg/HIV+ have a defect in modulating both the differentiation and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, which may contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses.

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that Treg/HIV+ have impaired suppressive effects on CD8+ T cells, particularly on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, and that this defect may contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance Treg function and restore HIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in chronic HIV infection.
Title: Evaluation of Wuchereria bancrofti Glutathione-S-transferase (WbGST) as a Vaccine Candidate against Lymphatic Filarial Infections

    Abstract:

    Background: Lymphatic filarial parasites, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, survive within the lymphatic vessels of their hosts for years, evading the immune system through various immunomodulatory strategies. One such strategy involves the release of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), which counteract oxidative free radicals produced by the host. We investigated the potential of WbGST as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis.

    Methods: The WbGST gene was cloned from the third-stage larval (L3) cDNA library of W. bancrofti, and recombinant WbGST (rWbGST) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for their reactivity with rWbGST.

    Main Findings: Our results showed that sera from endemic normal individuals (EN) carried significant levels of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies compared to subjects who were microfilaraemic (Mf) or showed symptoms of clinical pathology (CP). Isotype analysis revealed a predominance of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies in EN individuals. Functional analysis of rWbGST showed that the protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST, and antibodies in EN sera could inhibit this enzymatic activity. Similar results were obtained when anti-rWbGST antibodies raised in mice were used in the neutralization assay.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that WbGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. The vaccine potential of rWbGST was evaluated in a jird model, where approximately 61% protection could be achieved against a Brugia malayi L3 challenge infection in jirds immunized with rWbGST.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that WbGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis, with approximately 61% protection achievable against a B. malayi challenge infection in a jird model. The WbGST protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST, which appears to be critical for the survival of the parasite in the host. These findings support the development of WbGST as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis.
Title: Investigating Off-Target Effects of CRISPR-Cas9 Genome Editing in Experimental Organisms: A Whole-Genome Sequencing Study

    Abstract:
    Background: The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing in experimental organisms, offering immense therapeutic potential. However, concerns persist regarding off-target effects, which may arise from poor editing fidelity. Recent studies have employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to detect de novo mutations (DNMs) in gene-edited embryos or animals. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, limiting their ability to distinguish between generational or colony-related differences and true DNMs.

    Methods: To address this limitation, we employed a trio design, sequencing 8 parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were mutagenized with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the coat color Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. We analyzed the whole-genome data to determine whether CRISPR mutagenesis caused SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos.

    Main Findings: Our results indicate that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, the number of these mutations would not be statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes. This suggests that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing under the conditions used in our study does not introduce significant off-target effects.

    Implications: Our findings have important implications for the development of CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool. The results support further efforts to harness the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 for treating genetic diseases. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of using pedigree-matched controls to accurately assess the accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

    Conclusions: In conclusion, our whole-genome sequencing study provides evidence that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing under the conditions used in our study does not introduce significant off-target effects. Our results support the continued development of CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool and emphasize the need for rigorous experimental design, including the use of pedigree-matched controls, to accurately assess the accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7) in Regulating Stomatal Aperture in Response to Blue Light

    Abstract:
    Stomatal pores, located on the plant leaf epidermis, play a crucial role in regulating CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration. The stomatal aperture is influenced by various environmental signals, including blue light, which is perceived by cryptochromes and phototropins. However, the signal transduction cascades linking light perception to stomatal opening response remain poorly understood. Here, we identify two novel players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), and their genetic and biochemical interactions in regulating stomatal aperture in response to blue light. Our results show that mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HRB1 and PP7 are expressed in guard cells in response to light-to-dark or dark-to-light transitions. We demonstrate that HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires a functional PP7 for its stomatal opening response. Furthermore, we show that HRB1 is phosphorylated in vivo and that PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1. Our findings suggest that a modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential for acquiring a proper conformation or bringing in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. These results provide new insights into the regulation of stomatal aperture and may furnish strategies for improving crop yields under water-limiting conditions.

    Research Question:
    What are the genetic and biochemical interactions between Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7) in regulating stomatal aperture in response to blue light?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of HRB1 and PP7 in regulating stomatal aperture in response to blue light. We isolated hrb1 and pp7 mutants under red and blue light or blue light alone and analyzed their defects in the light-induced stomatal opening response. We also used stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying HRB1∶CFP and PP7∶YFP to study the co-localization of HRB1 and PP7 in guard cells.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. We also demonstrate that HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires a functional PP7 for its stomatal opening response. Furthermore, we show that HRB1 is phosphorylated in vivo and that PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of stomatal aperture and may furnish strategies for improving crop yields under water-limiting conditions. Understanding the genetic and biochemical interactions between HRB1 and PP7 may lead to the development of novel approaches for enhancing water use efficiency in crops.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study identifies HRB1 and PP7 as novel players in regulating stomatal aperture in response to blue light. We propose that a modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential for acquiring a proper conformation or bringing in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of HRB1 and PP7 in stomatal aperture regulation and to explore their potential applications in improving crop yields under water-limiting conditions.
Title: Mediator Subunit MDT-15 Integrates Transcriptional Responses to Ingested Materials in Caenorhabditis elegans

    Abstract:
    In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II (PolII)-dependent gene expression relies on accessory factors known as transcriptional coregulators. One such coregulator is the Mediator complex, which is targeted by numerous transcriptional regulatory factors. Here, we investigate the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans Mediator subunit MDT-15 in integrating transcriptional responses to ingested materials. Our results demonstrate that MDT-15 plays a critical role in regulating detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics and heavy metals, rendering C. elegans hypersensitive to toxin exposure upon its depletion or mutation. Notably, MDT-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, whereas other stress responses, such as thermotolerance, remain unaffected. We propose a model in which MDT-15 integrates several transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotic compounds. Our findings suggest that MDT-15 is an integral part of a regulatory system that coordinates systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring maintenance of health and longevity.

    Methods:
    We employed expression microarrays to compare the transcriptional profiles of wild-type C. elegans worms fed for 40 hours with those of MDT-15-depleted or mutant worms. We also analyzed the effects of MDT-15 functional defects on the expression of detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics and heavy metals.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that MDT-15 depletion or mutation abrogates the induction of specific detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics and heavy metals, rendering C. elegans hypersensitive to toxin exposure. Furthermore, MDT-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, whereas other stress responses, such as thermotolerance, remain unaffected.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that MDT-15 plays a critical role in integrating transcriptional responses to ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotic compounds. This regulatory function is essential for maintaining health and longevity in C. elegans.

    Conclusions:
    We propose a model in which MDT-15 integrates several transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials. Our results highlight the importance of MDT-15 in coordinating systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring the maintenance of health and longevity in C. elegans.

    **Title:** Decoding Spatial Information from Hippocampal Activity: A Topological Perspective

    **Research Question:** Can the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, be used to decode spatial information in the hippocampus, and if so, what is the nature of the resulting spatial map?

    **Methods:** We employed a computational model of hippocampal activity, varying three parameters (firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons) in computer simulations of rat trajectories in three topologically and geometrically distinct test environments. We used a computational algorithm based on Persistent Homology theory in algebraic topology to analyze the patterns of neuronal co-firing.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that the patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. We identified a "learning region" that highlights the interplay between the parameters in combining to produce hippocampal states that are more or less adept at map formation. For example, within the learning region, a lower number of neurons firing can be compensated by adjustments in firing rate or place field size, but beyond a certain point, map formation begins to fail.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the hippocampus creates a connectivity map derived from place cell co-firing patterns, which is topological in nature. This challenges the traditional view that the hippocampus encodes geometric information (distances, angles). Our results have specific implications for the qualities of the hippocampal spatial map and provide a coherent theoretical lens through which to view conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information in the hippocampus. We propose that the hippocampus creates a topological map of the environment, which can be derived from place cell co-firing patterns using computational tools from algebraic topology. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of spatial learning and memory, and highlight the importance of considering the topological properties of the hippocampal spatial map.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanisms of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Egress: A Combined RNAi Analysis and Live Cell Imaging Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) production involves the assembly of virions on or near lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements for and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete.

    Research Question: What are the host factors and cellular pathways involved in the egress of infectious HCV from cells?

    Methods: We combined RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion with live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress. RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome.

    Main Findings: Our results support a model wherein HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. Live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking using an infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein (TC-core) revealed that TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and this movement can be inhibited by nocodazole. Sub-populations of TC-core localize to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. Silencing of the recycling endosome component Rab11a results in the accumulation of HCV core at the Golgi. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles.

    Implications: This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress, while presenting dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells. The data from the RNAi screen delineates an egress pathway for HCV that heavily interplays with the constitutive secretory pathway, which is suggested for other viruses in the Flaviviridae family.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HCV egress and highlight the importance of the secretory pathway in the release of infectious HCV from cells. The identification of host cofactors and cellular pathways involved in HCV egress will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HCV infection.

    **Title:** Loss of Imprinted Gene Grb10 Promotes Tumorigenesis through Ras Signaling Hyperactivation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the imprinted gene Grb10 in tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of the Neurofibromatosis I (NF1) tumor suppressor gene?

    **Methods:** We used a mouse model of radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms that arise in irradiated NF1 patients to investigate the expression and function of Grb10. We performed expression analysis of tumor cell lines established from our mouse models, polymorphism analysis of cell lines and primary tumors, and functional studies to test the effects of Grb10 restoration or loss on tumor growth.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Grb10 is an imprinted gene that is commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant tumors arising in our mouse models. Functional studies revealed that restoring Grb10 in Nf1 mutant tumors decreases proliferation, decreases soft agar colony formation, and downregulates Ras signaling. Conversely, Grb10 silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) significantly increased cell proliferation and increased Ras-GTP levels. Expression of a constitutively activated MEK rescued tumor cells from Grb10-mediated reduction in colony formation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Grb10 loss can occur during in vivo tumorigenesis, with a functional consequence in untransformed primary cells. In tumors, Grb10 loss independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. This work identifies a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis and suggests that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin.

    **Conclusions:** This study reveals that Grb10 is a negative regulator of Ras signaling and contributes significantly to Ras dysregulation in the setting of Nf1-mediated tumorigenesis. Our findings have implications for the types of tumors that can be expected to arise after Grb10 loss and suggest that Grb10 loss may have tumor-promoting consequences in other oncogenic contexts. Overall, this work sheds light on the cellular responses to Grb10 loss, alone and when combined with Nf1, and highlights the importance of considering the role of imprinted genes in tumorigenesis.

    **Title:** Probabilistic Inference and Uncertainty Estimation in Pavlovian Threat Learning: A Psychophysiological Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How do humans learn to predict threat from environmental cues during Pavlovian fear conditioning, and what computational mechanisms underlie this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated human autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning using a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling. We compared the predictions of different computational models, including non-probabilistic models, a simple probabilistic model, and non-learning models, to ANS activity in three experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a probabilistic learning model best explains ANS responses, specifically skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size responses (PSR). Notably, SCR and PSR reflect different quantities of the same model: SCR tracks a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR tracks expected outcome alone. This suggests that the formation and maintenance of Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for theories of neural implementation of aversive learning. By combining psychophysiological modeling with computational learning theory, we provide systematic evidence that Pavlovian threat learning in humans is a probabilistic process that involves the estimation of uncertainty. This challenges traditional views of aversive learning as a deterministic process and highlights the importance of uncertainty estimation in threat prediction.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the computational mechanisms underlying Pavlovian threat learning in humans. The results demonstrate that probabilistic inference and uncertainty estimation are essential components of this process, and that different ANS responses (SCR and PSR) reflect different aspects of this process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of aversive learning and its neural implementation, and may inform the development of novel treatments for anxiety disorders.
Title: Crosstalk between the Septation Initiation Network (SIN) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Pathway Regulates Septation and Conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans

    Abstract:
    The septation initiation network (SIN) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are two conserved signaling cascades that play crucial roles in fungal cytokinesis, septation, and conidiation. In this study, we identified PomA as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans, a filamentous fungus. We found that PomA suppresses the activity of SepH, a key player in the SIN, and that SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of HogA, a downstream target of the MAPK pathway. Our results demonstrate that PomA and SepH indirectly regulate HogA phosphorylation through upstream kinases, indicating crosstalk between the SIN and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, we show that osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of HogA bypasses the requirement of SepH for septation and conidiation, suggesting that the MAPK pathway can compensate for the loss of SIN activity under stress conditions. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of septation and conidiation in A. nidulans and highlight the importance of crosstalk between the SIN and MAPK pathways in response to environmental stimuli.

    Research Question:
    How do the septation initiation network (SIN) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway interact to regulate septation and conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of PomA and SepH in regulating septation and conidiation in A. nidulans. We generated mutant strains of A. nidulans with altered PomA and SepH expression levels and analyzed their effects on septation, conidiation, and HogA phosphorylation.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that PomA suppresses the activity of SepH, a key player in the SIN, and that SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of HogA, a downstream target of the MAPK pathway. We also found that osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of HogA bypasses the requirement of SepH for septation and conidiation, suggesting that the MAPK pathway can compensate for the loss of SIN activity under stress conditions.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of septation and conidiation in A. nidulans and highlight the importance of crosstalk between the SIN and MAPK pathways in response to environmental stimuli. The identification of PomA as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation suggests that it may be a potential target for the development of novel antifungal therapies.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the SIN and MAPK pathways interact to regulate septation and conidiation in A. nidulans, and that crosstalk between these pathways is essential for the proper regulation of these processes. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of fungal cell biology and the development of novel antifungal therapies.
Title: Investigating the Association between Leishmania RNA Virus 1 (LRV1) and Clinical Manifestations of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in Brazil

    Abstract:
    Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is a significant public health concern in Latin America, with Brazil accounting for approximately 20,000 cases annually. Despite its endemicity, the pathogenesis of TL remains poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) in the severity of mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) in experimental animal models. This study aimed to investigate the presence of LRV1 in patients with cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in Brazil and its association with clinical manifestations.

    Methods:
    A total of 156 patients diagnosed with TL at Rondonia's Hospital of Tropical Medicine were included in the study. Clinical diagnoses were confirmed by PCR targeting hsp70 and kDNA DNA sequences, and the species causing the infection were determined by HSP70 PCR-RFPL. The presence of LRV1 was tested by RT-PCR.

    Main Findings:
    Five Leishmania species were detected: Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (77.6%), Leishmania (V.) guyanensis (11.5%), Leishmania (V.) lainsoni (1.8%), Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis (1.3%), and Leishmania (V.) shawi (1.3%). LRV1 was detected in 71.1% (n=27) of mucosal lesions and 36.7% (n=40) of cutaneous lesions. The ratio of mucosal lesions positive for LRV1 to mucosal lesions negative for LRV1 was 2.93 (CI 95% 1.57-5.46; p<0.001), indicating a significant association between LRV1 and the occurrence of mucosal leishmaniasis.

    Implications:
    This study provides new evidence on the relationship between LRV1 and the clinical manifestations of TL in Brazil. The findings suggest that LRV1 is associated with the development of mucosal leishmaniasis, but it is not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome. The study highlights the importance of considering LRV1 in the diagnosis and treatment of TL, particularly in regions where LRV1 is prevalent.

    Conclusions:
    This study contributes to the understanding of the pathogenesis of TL and the role of LRV1 in its clinical manifestations. The findings have implications for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for TL, particularly in regions where LRV1 is endemic. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association between LRV1 and TL and to explore the potential use of LRV1 as a biomarker for disease severity.

    **Title:** Type I Interferon Plays a Crucial Role in Host Defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the functional significance of Type I Interferon (IFN-I) in the host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using mice deficient in the Type I Interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) and mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against the Type I Interferon receptor. Additionally, mice were treated with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)).

    **Main Findings:** Mice lacking the Type I Interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against the Type I Interferon receptor exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection, while maintaining comparable bacterial numbers in the lung. In contrast, treatment of mice with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)) dramatically reduced the development of bacteremia following intranasal infection with S. pneumoniae. IFNβ treatment led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of the pneumococcal uptake receptor, platelet activating factor receptor (PAF receptor).

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that IFN-I plays an important role in the host defense against pneumococcal infection by regulating two possible mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion: PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration. This ultimately limits the progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our data identify IFN-I as an important component of the host immune defense that regulates the transition of pneumococci from the lung into the bloodstream. The upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of PAF receptor expression by IFNβ suggest a novel mechanism by which IFN-I counteracts pneumococcal invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers. These findings highlight the importance of IFN-I in the host defense against pneumococcal infection and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of pneumococcal disease.

    **Title:** Multilayered Spiking Neural Networks with Reward-Modulated and Non-Reward Modulated STDP for Advanced Pattern Discrimination and Continuous Learning

    **Research Question:** Can a multilayered spiking neural network with both reward-modulated and non-reward modulated Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learn and perform complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification and decision making?

    **Methods:** We designed and simulated a multilayered spiking neural network with two plastic layers, incorporating both reward-modulated and non-reward modulated STDP. The network consisted of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, with one-to-many connections from the input layer to the hidden layer and all-to-all connections from the hidden layer to the output layer. We implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP, and hard limits on synaptic strength.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-reward modulated STDP enabled the network to respond to specific combinations of inputs and perform basic classification of input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network learned to discriminate between rewarding patterns and punishing patterns, despite the absence of labeled training data. Synaptic noise allowed for trial-and-error learning, enabling the network to identify goal-oriented strategies effective in task solving.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that a multilayered spiking neural network with both reward-modulated and non-reward modulated STDP is capable of solving complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification and decision making. This finding has implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying learning and decision making in biological systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our results predict a critical set of properties of the spiking neuronal network with STDP that is sufficient to solve complex foraging tasks. The combination of reward-modulated and non-reward modulated STDP, along with multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, enables the network to learn and perform advanced pattern discrimination and continuous learning. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying learning and decision making, and has potential applications in the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

    **Title:** ELF5 Drives Metastasis in Luminal Breast Cancer by Co-opting the Innate Immune System

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the ETS transcription factor ELF5 in driving metastasis in luminal breast cancer, and how does it interact with the innate immune system?

    **Methods:** We used an inducible mouse model of mammary-specific ELF5 expression in the context of luminal mammary tumors induced by PyMT expression to investigate the roles played by ELF5 during mammary carcinogenesis and progression to metastatic disease.

    **Main Findings:** We found that increased ELF5 levels in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of luminal breast cancer led to increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors, resulting in a significant increase in the size and number of lung metastases. We also observed that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a group of immature neutrophils, were recruited to the tumor in response to ELF5 and played a crucial role in vasculogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of MDSCs using specific Ly6G antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ELF5 is a key determinant of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer, driving metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. We also found that increased ELF5 expression in human luminal A breast cancers was correlated with increased myeloid cell invasion and inflammation, and predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the role of ELF5 in driving metastasis in luminal breast cancer, and highlights the importance of the innate immune system in this process. Our findings have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting ELF5 and the immune system in the treatment of luminal A breast cancer.

    **Title:** Investigating the Impact of Chromatin Loop Interactions on Gene Expression Variability: A Stochastic Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How do changes in chromatin loop interactions, characterized by connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form, affect cell-to-cell variability in gene expression?

    **Methods:** We developed a mechanistic model that maps three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of stochastic transcription. We analyzed the effects of different loop connection patterns (side-by-side, nested, and alternating) and communication forms (facilitated tracking and direct looping) on gene expression variability.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, whereas alternating loops have opposite effects compared to side-by-side loops. We also found that facilitated tracking outperforms direct looping in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise, but this control is distance-dependent and limited to moderate loop lengths. Furthermore, we identified a critical loop length beyond which the difference in effect between facilitated tracking and direct looping becomes negligible.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a systematic understanding of how chromatin loop interactions influence gene expression variability. The facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis is supported by our analysis, suggesting that facilitated tracking is a more effective mechanism for controlling gene expression and reducing variability. These findings have important implications for understanding the complex regulation of gene expression and its role in cellular heterogeneity.

    **Conclusions:** Our stochastic modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for understanding the impact of chromatin loop interactions on gene expression variability. By elucidating the effects of different loop connection patterns and communication forms, our study contributes to the development of a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation and its role in cellular heterogeneity. These findings have significant implications for understanding the complex relationships between chromatin structure, gene expression, and cellular variability.

    **Title:** De Novo Design of Pure Riboregulators: A Framework for Efficient Gene Repression through Translation Inhibiting RNAs

    **Background:** Metabolic engineering relies heavily on RNA technology to rewire metabolism and maximize production. However, the development of pure riboregulators, which repress gene expression without the need for coexpressed proteins, is hindered by the lack of clear design principles.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a framework for the de novo design of pure riboregulators, referred to as translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), that repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation?

    **Methods:** We employed a design of experiments (DOE) approach to analyze the influence of 12 structural and thermodynamic features previously attributed to post-transcriptional gene modulation. From an in silico generated riboregulator library, 18 riboregulators were selected and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the translation inhibiting RNA features to functionality.

    **Main Findings:** The pure riboregulators showed repression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels, which could only be partially explained by an ordinary least squares regression model. A partial least squares regression model was constructed and validated to link the properties of translation inhibiting RNA riboregulators to gene repression. Both structural and thermodynamic features were found to be important for efficient gene repression by pure riboregulators.

    **Implications:** This approach enables a more reliable de novo forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, expanding the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation. By avoiding the need for coexpressed proteins, pure riboregulators reduce metabolic burden, which can lead to long-term genetic instability and unexpected behavior.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a framework for the de novo design of pure riboregulators, which can be used to repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. This approach has the potential to revolutionize metabolic engineering by providing a more efficient and reliable method for designing riboregulators, ultimately leading to improved production yields and reduced metabolic burden.

**Title:** Deciphering Transient Associations among Neurons through Coherence Potentials

**Research Question:** How do transient associations among neurons occur and how can they be identified?

**Methods:** We recorded ongoing local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites within the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex to investigate the mechanisms underlying transient associations among neurons.

**Main Findings:** We discovered that when the composite activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its activity pattern, as reflected in the LFP, occurs without distortion at other cortex sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, which we term coherence potentials, extend up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information, similar to action potentials at the single-cell level. Notably, coherence potentials exhibit a high degree of diversity in their waveforms, providing a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and enabling the identification of particular associations.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that coherence potentials play a crucial role in the propagation of information across cortical regions, allowing for the transfer of meaningful information in the cortical network. The preservation of temporal characteristics of the underlying neuronal activity during coherence potential propagation is consistent with the idea that temporal properties of the LFP waveform often serve as better predictors of behaviors than spikes.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying transient associations among neurons, highlighting the importance of coherence potentials in the propagation of information across cortical regions. The diversity of coherence potential waveforms provides a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information, allowing for the identification of particular associations. These findings have implications for our understanding of memory and behavior, and may shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying social networks and the spread of ideas and behaviors.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Nuclear Size Control in Fission Yeast

    **Research Question:** What are the essential factors involved in regulating nuclear size in fission yeast, and how do they contribute to the maintenance of a constant nuclear-to-cell volume (N/C) ratio?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genetic screen of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) gene deletion mutants to identify essential factors involved in nuclear size control. We generated cells displaying a 35-fold range of cell volumes through genetic mutations and nutritional states, and observed the N/C ratio across this range.

    **Main Findings:** Our screen identified 25 essential factors that alter nuclear size, and bioinformatic analyses implicated RNA processing and LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complexes in the control of nuclear size. We observed that nuclear volume increases steadily with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant N/C ratio throughout interphase, with no sudden increase in nuclear size accompanying DNA replication in S phase.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that both the regulation of global cellular processes, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis, and the regulation of specific structural components of the nucleus are crucial for maintaining a constant N/C ratio. This is consistent with previous studies in multicellular organisms, which have shown that the N/C ratio varies between cell types but is generally restricted to a narrow range for cells of each type.

    **Conclusions:** This study has revealed novel roles for essential factors in nuclear size control and has provided insights into the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of a constant N/C ratio in fission yeast. Our findings have implications for understanding the regulation of nuclear size in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, and highlight the importance of RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying nuclear size control and to explore the conservation of these mechanisms across different cell types and organisms.

    **Title:** Predicting Optimal Stimulation Strategies for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation in Neurological Disorders

    **Research Question:** Can a mathematical model of coupled oscillators be used to predict the optimal stimulation strategy for closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor (ET)?

    **Methods:** We employed a reduced form of the Kuramoto model to analyze the effects of DBS on neural oscillations in patients with ET. We used a coupled oscillator model to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations and predicted how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude.

    **Main Findings:** Our model predicts that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and that stimulation should have a greater effect if applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. We compared these predictions with data obtained from ET patients and found that they generalize to other models, including a biologically realistic model of a neural circuit generating oscillations related to Parkinson’s disease.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the development of closed-loop DBS strategies. We propose a new hybrid strategy that combines two existing approaches: phase-locked and adaptive DBS. This hybrid strategy has the potential to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and reduction of side effects of DBS.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of mathematical modeling to inform the development of optimal stimulation strategies for closed-loop DBS. By using a coupled oscillator model, we were able to predict the phase-dependent effects of stimulation and propose a new hybrid strategy that combines the benefits of phase-locked and adaptive DBS. These findings have important implications for the treatment of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and ET, and highlight the need for further research into the development of personalized DBS strategies.
Title: Development and Evaluation of a Novel Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for Rapid Detection of Schistosoma mansoni in Biomphalaria snails

    Abstract:
    Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, remains a significant public health concern, affecting over 230 million people worldwide. The development of molecular monitoring assays for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites is crucial for snail control interventions related to schistosomiasis elimination. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay combined with a simple DNA extraction method for detecting S. mansoni in experimentally infected Biomphalaria snails.

    Methods:
    A LAMP assay was designed using a set of six primers targeting the S. mansoni ribosomal intergenic spacer 28S-18S rRNA sequence. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. The assay was evaluated by examining S. mansoni DNA in B. glabrata snails experimentally exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure: early prepatent period, light infections, and detection of infected snails in pooled samples. DNA for LAMP assays was obtained using a commercial DNA extraction kit or a simple heat NaOH extraction method.

    Main Findings:
    The LAMP assay, named Biompha-LAMP, was found to be specific, sensitive, and rapid, with a detection limit of 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA. The assay was able to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails, including early prepatent period, light infections, and pooled samples, using a simple and economic DNA extraction method.

    Implications:
    The Biompha-LAMP assay has the potential to be a cost-effective method for screening intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples. This assay could be suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates the development and evaluation of a novel LAMP assay for detecting S. mansoni in Biomphalaria snails. The Biompha-LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method that can be used for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites. This assay has the potential to contribute to the control and elimination of schistosomiasis in endemic areas. Further validation of the assay using DNA samples from other Biomphalaria species and Schistosoma species is recommended.
Title: Estimating the Economic Burden of Dengue Response in the Public Health Sector of Sri Lanka: A Cost Analysis of Dengue Control Activities and Hospitalizations in Colombo District, 2012

     Abstract:
     Dengue has emerged as a high-priority public health problem in Sri Lanka since the 1960s, placing a significant financial burden on the public health sector. This study aimed to estimate the public sector costs of dengue control activities and direct costs of hospitalizations in Colombo, the most heavily urbanized district in Sri Lanka, during the epidemic year of 2012. Using a combination of activity-based and gross costing approaches, we retrospectively analyzed the financial costs borne by public health agencies and hospitals in Colombo district. Our results indicate that the total cost of dengue control and reported hospitalizations was estimated at US$3.45 million (US$1.50 per capita) in Colombo district in 2012. Personnel costs accounted for the largest share of the total costs of dengue control activities (79%) and hospitalizations (46%). The average costs per hospitalization ranged between US$216–609 for pediatric cases and US$196–866 for adult cases, depending on disease severity and treatment setting. Our analysis suggests that dengue poses a significant economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka, with a per capita cost of US$0.42 for dengue control activities. These findings highlight the need for country-specific evidence to inform public health priorities and the deployment of existing or new technologies to mitigate the economic burden of dengue response in Sri Lanka.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Origins of European Y-Chromosomal Lineages: A Neolithic Origin for Haplogroup R1b1b2

    **Research Question:** What is the origin of the most common European Y-chromosomal lineage, haplogroup R1b1b2 (R-M269), and how does it relate to the Neolithic expansion in Europe?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity within haplogroup R1b1b2 to infer its origins and migration patterns. We used a combination of genetic and statistical methods to reconstruct the history of this lineage.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity within haplogroup R1b1b2 is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. This contradicts previous studies suggesting a Paleolithic origin for this lineage. We also found that other European Y-chromosomal lineages, such as haplogroups E1b1b1 (E-M35) and J, show evidence of Neolithic expansion.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that most European Y chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion, indicating a unique role for males in the transition. This is in contrast to mitochondrial DNA, which shows a different picture, with no east-west cline and most lineages having a Paleolithic time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA).

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the origins of European Y-chromosomal lineages and their relationship to technological and cultural change. The predominance of Neolithic-expansion lineages among Y chromosomes highlights the importance of males in shaping the genetic landscape of Europe during this period. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of human migration and population dynamics in Europe.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Relationship Between Movement Variability and Motor Learning: A Computational Modeling and Experimental Approach

    **Research Question:** Does movement variability directly increase the speed of motor learning, and if so, under what conditions?

    **Methods:** We employed computational modeling of motor adaptation using an optimal learner model to simulate error-based learning. We also conducted four experiments to investigate the relationship between movement variability and learning rate. Additionally, we performed a meta-analysis of published papers to verify our findings across a wide range of experiments.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to previous suggestions, our model simulations and experimental data reveal that movement variability does not generally increase learning speed. In fact, increased variability can sometimes slow down learning. Our meta-analysis of published papers found no statistical relation between movement variability and learning rate across a wide range of experiments. However, we propose that the relationship between motor variability and learning rate may be task-specific, depending on which factor predominantly affects task performance.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that movement variability directly increases the speed of motor learning. Instead, we suggest that motor variability poses a fundamental problem for neural control of movements, and its relationship with learning rate is complex and context-dependent. Our results highlight the need for further research to understand the relative importance of various factors involved in motor learning.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the relationship between movement variability and learning rate is not as straightforward as previously thought. We propose that motor variability is correlated with learning rate in a task-specific way, depending on which factor dominates task performance. Our findings have important implications for understanding motor learning and adaptation, and highlight the need for further research to elucidate the complex interactions between movement variability and learning rate. Ultimately, our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the neural control of movements and the factors that influence motor learning.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Analysis of the RelA:CBP/p300 Interaction Reveals a Novel Mechanism of NF-κB-Dependent Gene Regulation

    **Research Question:** How does the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction regulate the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes, and what is the role of this interaction in the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of NMR spectroscopy, mutational analysis, isothermal calorimetry, cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis to investigate the structure and function of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction.

    **Main Findings:** We solved the solution structure of the RelA-TA2:TAZ1 component of the RelA:CBP/p300 complex by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the folding of RelA-TA2 upon binding to TAZ1. We also designed RelA-mutants that selectively abrogated the two distinct components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis, we showed that a major set of RelA-activated genes, larger than previously believed, is affected by this interaction.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction plays a crucial role in regulating the nuclear response of NF-κB through the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway. We also found that genes like nfkbia and ptgs2, previously considered independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction, are actually dependent on it.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of NF-κB-dependent gene regulation, where the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the temporal profile of nuclear NF-κB following TNFα stimulation. The constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300 to RelA target gene promoters suggests a possible role of CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the regulation of NF-κB-dependent genes and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the NF-κB pathway.
Title: Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA): A Hypothesis-Driven Method for Analyzing Longitudinal Gene Expression Data

    Abstract:

    Background: Gene set analysis methods have been successfully applied to analyze gene expression data in cross-sectional studies. However, the analysis of longitudinal data remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA), an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data.

    Research Question: Can TcGSA identify a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets?

    Methods: TcGSA relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates, allowing for the use of all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements.

    Main Findings: We applied TcGSA to two real-life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial) and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, whereas standard univariate individual gene analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. Additionally, TcGSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the influenza vaccine, which were previously associated with the pneumococcal vaccine.

    Implications: TcGSA provides a hypothesis-driven method for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data, enabling the detection of subtle changes in gene expression over time while controlling for false discovery.

    Conclusions: Our simulation study demonstrated the good statistical properties and increased power of TcGSA compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. TcGSA is made available to the community through an R package, providing a valuable tool for the analysis of longitudinal gene expression data in systems immunology research.
Title: Mapping the Global Endemicity of Plasmodium vivax: A Systematic Effort to Inform Control and Elimination Strategies

    Abstract:
    The spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a neglected malaria parasite, remain poorly understood compared to P. falciparum. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic effort to map the global endemicity of P. vivax using a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach. Our research question was: What is the global distribution of P. vivax endemicity, and what are the implications for control and elimination strategies?

    Methods:
    We assembled 9,970 geopositioned P. vivax parasite rate (PvPR) surveys collected from 1985 to 2010 and used a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity age-standardized to the 1-99 year age range (PvPR1-99) within every 5x5 km resolution grid square. We incorporated data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions, particularly in Africa.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that P. vivax endemicity is predicted within a relatively narrow range throughout the endemic world, with the point estimate rarely exceeding 7% PvPR1-99. The Americas contributed 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high endemic areas were generally sparsely populated and contributed only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk (PAR) globally. In Africa, Duffy negativity constrained stable transmission to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% of global PAR. Central Asia was home to 82% of global PAR, with important high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations in India and Myanmar. South East Asia contained areas of the highest endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and contributed 9% of global PAR.

    Implications:
    Our detailed depiction of spatially varying endemicity is intended to contribute to a paradigm shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination. The results highlight the need for targeted interventions in high-risk areas, particularly in Central Asia and South East Asia, where dense populations coincide with high endemicity.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides the first comprehensive map of P. vivax endemicity and estimates of populations at risk globally. Our findings underscore the importance of considering the spatial distribution of P. vivax in control and elimination strategies, and highlight the need for targeted interventions in high-risk areas to effectively combat this neglected disease.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Role of Clumping Factor B in Staphylococcus aureus Skin and Soft Tissue Infections

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Clumping Factor B (ClfB) in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), and can it serve as a candidate antigen for future SSTI vaccines?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of ClfB in SSTIs. The interaction between ClfB and its ligand, loricrin, was examined using surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation assays. A mouse model of SSTI was used to assess the impact of ClfB on abscess structure and bacterial burden. A model vaccine targeting ClfB was also developed and tested for its efficacy in protecting against S. aureus skin infection.

    **Main Findings:** This study reveals a novel role for ClfB in SSTIs, demonstrating that it plays a crucial role in determining abscess structure and bacterial burden early in infection. The interaction between ClfB and loricrin is essential for this process, and targeting ClfB using a model vaccine leads to protection against S. aureus skin infection.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of next-generation vaccines targeting S. aureus SSTIs. ClfB is identified as an important antigen for inclusion in future vaccines, and its interaction with loricrin provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first evidence of ClfB's role in SSTIs and demonstrates its potential as a candidate antigen for SSTI vaccines. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying S. aureus pathogenesis and provide a framework for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat SSTIs. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the role of ClfB in SSTIs and to explore its potential as a vaccine antigen.

    Title: Predicting Prophylactic Efficacy of Dolutegravir for HIV Prevention: An Integrative Stochastic Simulation Approach

    Research Question: Can an integrative stochastic simulation approach, combining pharmacological, viral, and host factors, predict the prophylactic efficacy of dolutegravir (DTG) for HIV prevention?

    Methods: We developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, integrating population pharmacokinetics of DTG with a stochastic framework. We predicted plasma concentrations of DTG required to prevent 50% and 90% sexual transmissions, as well as the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), PrEP ‘on demand’, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

    Main Findings: Our simulations indicated that once-daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP ‘on demand’ prevented 79-84% infections, and PEP >80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. We also found that initiating prophylaxis earlier has a more pronounced effect than prolonging PEP, arguing for the immediate start of PEP in case of known- or suspected HIV exposure.

    Implications: Our results suggest that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada, and the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide the release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations. This integrative framework can be adapted to other PrEP candidates, enabling the intelligent design of once-daily, episodic PrEP, as well as simulating the on- and offset of event-driven PrEP or long-acting injectable PrEP formulations.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential of an integrative stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy and guide the development of next-generation PrEP regimens. By integrating pharmacological, viral, and host factors, this approach can help prioritize and design PrEP regimens, reducing clinical failure rates and associated costs. Our results highlight the importance of early initiation of PEP and the potential of DTG as a non-inferior alternative to Truvada for HIV prevention.
Title: Temporal Regulation of Autophagic Flux by Hepatitis C Virus to Enhance Replication

    Abstract:
    Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy to facilitate its replication. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy-related proteins Rubicon and UVRAG in HCV replication. Our results demonstrate that HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which differentially regulate the maturation of autophagosomes. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, leading to their accumulation in the early stages of infection, whereas UVRAG stimulates their maturation, resulting in efficient autophagic flux at later time points. We show that Rubicon plays a positive role in HCV replication, as its suppression reduces viral replication, whereas its over-expression enhances it. In contrast, UVRAG over-expression suppresses HCV replication by facilitating the maturation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the HCV NS4B protein is sufficient to induce Rubicon and autophagosomes. Our findings suggest that HCV temporally regulates the autophagic flux by differentially inducing the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to enhance its replication. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV replication and highlights the potential of targeting autophagy-related proteins as a therapeutic strategy to combat HCV infection.

    Research Question:
    How does HCV regulate the autophagic pathway to enhance its replication?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of molecular biology techniques, including siRNA knockdown, over-expression, and subgenomic RNA replicon assays, to investigate the role of Rubicon and UVRAG in HCV replication.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which differentially regulate the maturation of autophagosomes. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, leading to their accumulation in the early stages of infection, whereas UVRAG stimulates their maturation, resulting in efficient autophagic flux at later time points. We also demonstrate that Rubicon plays a positive role in HCV replication, as its suppression reduces viral replication, whereas its over-expression enhances it. In contrast, UVRAG over-expression suppresses HCV replication by facilitating the maturation of autophagosomes.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that HCV temporally regulates the autophagic flux by differentially inducing the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to enhance its replication. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV replication and highlights the potential of targeting autophagy-related proteins as a therapeutic strategy to combat HCV infection.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that HCV regulates the autophagic pathway by differentially inducing the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to enhance its replication. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HCV infection.

    **Title:** Cyclin Y-like 1 (Ccnyl1) Regulates Spermatogenesis and Male Fertility through Interaction with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 16 (CDK16)

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Cyclin Y-like 1 (Ccnyl1) in spermatogenesis and male fertility, and how does it interact with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 16 (CDK16)?

    **Methods:** We generated Ccnyl1 knockout (Ccnyl1-/-) mice and analyzed their fertility, sperm motility, and testicular expression of Ccnyl1 and CDK16. We also examined the interaction between Ccnyl1 and CDK16 using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Ccnyl1 is highly expressed in the testis of mice and is essential for male fertility. Male Ccnyl1-/- mice were infertile, while female Ccnyl1-/- mice were fertile. Spermatozoa from Ccnyl1-/- mice displayed impaired motility and structural defects. We also found that the protein level of CDK16 was decreased in the testis of Ccnyl1-/- mice, and that Ccnyl1 interacted with CDK16, increasing its stability and kinase activity.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role of Ccnyl1 in regulating spermatogenesis through its interaction with CDK16. The Ccnyl1:CDK16 complex is essential for male fertility, and its dysregulation leads to impaired sperm motility and fertility. These findings suggest that Ccnyl1 may be a potential target for male contraceptive development.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that Ccnyl1 plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis and male fertility through its interaction with CDK16. The Ccnyl1:CDK16 complex is essential for maintaining the enzymatic activity of CDK16 at the plasma membrane of spermatogenic cells, and its dysregulation leads to impaired fertility. These findings have important implications for the development of male contraceptives and the understanding of spermatogenesis.

    **Title:** OMV-associated EHEC-Hly Triggers Apoptosis in Human Microvascular Endothelial and Intestinal Epithelial Cells via Mitochondrial Permeabilization

    **Background:** Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains cause severe diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) due to toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. EHEC hemolysin (EHEC-Hly), a member of the RTX family, is an increasingly recognized virulence factor.

    **Research Question:** What are the biological effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, which are the major targets during EHEC infection?

    **Methods:** We used microscopic, biochemical, flow cytometry, and functional analyses of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells to investigate the effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly does not lyse HBMEC and Caco-2 cells but triggers their apoptosis. The toxin is internalized via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficked with OMVs into endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly escapes from the lysosomes via its pore-forming activity and targets mitochondria, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and translocation of cytochrome c to the cytosol.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly triggers the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases. The OMV-mediated intracellular delivery represents a newly recognized mechanism for a bacterial toxin to enter host cells and target mitochondria.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly irreversibly injures human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, which are key players in the pathogenesis of EHEC-mediated diseases. The ability of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly to trigger apoptosis via mitochondrial permeabilization highlights the importance of this toxin in the development of EHEC diseases.
Title: Bidirectional Communication between H2Bub1 and Cdk9 Regulates Transcription Elongation in Fission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe

    Abstract:

    Background: Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is accompanied by conserved patterns of histone modification. However, the functions of histone modifications during elongation are not well understood. Mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification and regulating gene expression.

    Research Question: What is the relationship between H2Bub1 and Cdk9, the ortholog of metazoan positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), during transcription elongation in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe?

    Methods: We used chemical and classical genetic analyses to investigate the relationship between H2Bub1 and Cdk9 in S. pombe. We also performed genome-wide analyses by chromatin immunoprecipitation to examine the effects of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 on the distribution of transcribing RNAPII.

    Main Findings: Our results show that lowering Cdk9 activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, the transcription processivity factor Spt5, reduces H2Bub1 in vivo. Conversely, mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. We also found that an Spt5 phosphorylation-site mutation, combined with deletion of the histone H3 Lys4 methyltransferase Set1, phenocopies morphologic and growth defects due to H2Bub1 loss. Furthermore, mutation of the histone H2B ubiquitin-acceptor residue relaxes the Cdk9 activity requirement in vivo, and Cdk9 mutations suppress cell-morphology defects in H2Bub1-deficient strains.

    Implications: Our findings reveal bidirectional communication between H2Bub1 and Cdk9, with mutual dependence on each other for proper function. We also show that H2Bub1 acts independently of histone methylation, and that the Set1-independent pathway is important for normal cell growth and morphology, as well as elongation by RNAPII at select target genes.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the regulation of transcription elongation by H2Bub1 and Cdk9 in S. pombe. The bidirectional communication between H2Bub1 and Cdk9 highlights the importance of maintaining a balance between these two factors to regulate elongation. Loss of H2Bub1 disrupts this balance, leading to deranged gene expression and aberrant cell morphologies. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of transcription elongation and the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.
Title: Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Yellow Fever Virus: A Phylogenetic Analysis of 133 Viral Isolates from 22 Countries

    Abstract:
    Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant public health concern in South America and Africa, causing severe morbidity and mortality. To elucidate the evolutionary history of this reemerging pathogen, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the prM/E gene region from 133 viral isolates collected from 22 countries over a 76-year period. Our results indicate that the currently circulating strains of YFV originated in Africa approximately 1,500 years ago and were introduced to the Americas via the slave trade around 300-400 years ago. The virus then spread westward across the continent, establishing a sylvatic enzootic cycle in the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins, vectored by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. Our study demonstrates the utility of gene sequence data in testing hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and highlights the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.

    Methods:
    We compiled the largest YFV data set to date, comprising 133 viral isolates from 22 countries, including 14 from Africa and 8 from South America. The prM/E gene region was sequenced and aligned, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

    Main Findings:
    Our phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct geographic groups of YFV, with separate lineages observed in Africa and the Americas. Notably, we found no significant difference in evolutionary dynamics between viruses circulating in South America and Africa, and neither population exhibited the expected increases in virus diversity associated with epidemic expansion. Our results support the hypothesis that YFV was introduced to the Americas via the slave trade, and that the virus established a sylvatic enzootic cycle in the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins.

    Implications:
    Our study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of YFV, highlighting the importance of human migration in the spread of infectious disease. The findings have significant implications for public health policy and disease surveillance, particularly in regions where YFV is endemic.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our phylogenetic analysis of 133 YFV isolates from 22 countries provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of this reemerging pathogen. Our results demonstrate the utility of gene sequence data in testing hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and underscore the critical role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.

    **Title:** Population Bottlenecks in Streptococcus pneumoniae Pathogenesis: Insights from an Infant Mouse Model of Co-infection with Influenza A Virus

    **Research Question:** What are the vulnerable points in the multiple steps involved in pneumococcal pathogenesis, particularly in the context of co-infection with Influenza A Virus (IAV)?

    **Methods:** We utilized an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission to study a virulent isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both with and without IAV co-infection. The model allowed for a comprehensive analysis of population bottlenecks, which are sharp reductions in population size due to environmental constraints.

    **Main Findings:** Our findings reveal that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. Notably, passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. Instead, the bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, highlighting the critical role of the number of shed organisms in secretions in overcoming this barrier.

    **Implications:** These observations demonstrate how viral infection, and the TLR-dependent innate immune responses it stimulates, drive bacterial contagion. Furthermore, our results suggest that IAV co-infection increases the burden of colonizing pneumococci, consistent with prior observations in infant mice.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of pneumococcal pathogenesis, particularly in the context of co-infection with IAV. By identifying vulnerable points in the multiple steps involved in pneumococcal pathogenesis, our findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat pneumococcal disease.
Title: Development of Recombinant Salivary Antigens for Screening Human Sera for Exposure to Phlebotomus orientalis Bites in Visceral Leishmaniasis Endemic Areas

    Abstract:
    Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania donovani, is a life-threatening disease transmitted by Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies in Eastern Africa. To evaluate exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease-endemic areas, we developed and tested recombinant Phlebotomus orientalis salivary antigens for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. We produced five recombinant proteins using bacterial expression systems and four using mammalian expression systems, and screened human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia using ELISA and immunoblotting. Two recombinant proteins, mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens, showing high correlation coefficients and specificity compared to whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. The combination of both proteins further increased correlation coefficients and positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure. This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. Our results demonstrate that the combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 is a valid tool for screening human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P. orientalis bites. The use of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P. orientalis antibody responses.

    Research Question:
    Can recombinant Phlebotomus orientalis salivary antigens be used to screen human sera for exposure to P. orientalis bites in visceral leishmaniasis endemic areas?

    Methods:
    We produced five recombinant proteins using bacterial expression systems and four using mammalian expression systems, and screened human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia using ELISA and immunoblotting.

    Main Findings:
    Two recombinant proteins, mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens, showing high correlation coefficients and specificity compared to whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. The combination of both proteins further increased correlation coefficients and positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure.

    Implications:
    Our results demonstrate that the combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 is a valid tool for screening human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P. orientalis bites. The use of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P. orientalis antibody responses.

    Conclusions:
    This study identified the combination of two major P. orientalis salivary antigens, yellow-related protein mYEL1 and antigen 5-related protein mAG5, as a valid tool to screen sand fly exposure in humans from both Sudan and Ethiopia. This combination of stable recombinant proteins is able to substitute P. orientalis SGH and thereby simplify studies aimed at detecting antibodies in bitten people in endemic areas of visceral leishmaniasis.

    **Title:** Remodeling of the Mating Pore by Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1) Enhances Its Transmissibility in the Presence of IncC Plasmids

    **Background:** IncC conjugative plasmids and Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) are frequently associated with multidrug resistance in clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. SGI1 is mobilized in trans by IncA and IncC plasmids (A/C plasmids) following its excision from the chromosome, an event triggered by the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD encoded by these helper plasmids.

    **Research Question:** We investigated the regulation of traNS and traHGS genes of SGI1 and their role in the transmissibility of SGI1 in the presence of IncC plasmids.

    **Methods:** Transcriptional fusion of the promoter sequences of traNS and traHGS to the reporter gene lacZ confirmed that expression of these genes is inducible by AcaCD. Mating experiments using combinations of deletion mutants of SGI1 and the helper IncC plasmid pVCR94 revealed complex interactions between these two mobile genetic elements.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that traNC and traHGC are essential for IncC plasmid transfer, but SGI1 can rescue null mutants of each individual gene, indicating that TraNS, TraHS, and TraGS are functional proteins. Complementation assays of individual traC and traS mutants showed that not only do TraNS/HS/GS replace TraNC/HC/GC in the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids but also that traGS and traHS are both required for SGI1 optimal transfer. Furthermore, remodeling of the IncC-encoded mating pore by SGI1 was found to be essential to enhance transfer rate of SGI1 over the helper plasmid.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that SGI1 remodels the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids to enhance its own transfer, thereby disabling an IncC-encoded entry exclusion mechanism. This implies that traS genes facilitate the invasion by SGI1 of cell populations bearing IncC plasmids.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the complex interactions between SGI1 and IncC plasmids, highlighting the importance of traNS, traHS, and traGS genes in the transmissibility of SGI1. These findings have significant implications for understanding the spread of multidrug resistance in clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae.

    **Title:** Polo-like Kinase Cdc5 Promotes Adaptation to DNA Damage by Attenuating the DNA Damage Checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** How does Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapt to persistent or irreparable DNA damage, and what is the role of polo-like kinase Cdc5 in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of Cdc5 in adaptation to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae by overexpressing CDC5 from the GAL1 promoter in damaged cells and examining key steps in checkpoint activation individually.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Cdc5 overproduction promotes faster adaptation to DNA damage, indicating that high levels of Cdc5 modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit the downstream cell-cycle machinery. We found that Cdc5 overproduction has little effect on the early steps leading to Rad53 activation, including checkpoint sensor localization, Mec1-phosphorylation of Rad9, and formation of the Rad9-Rad53 complex. However, damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 was significantly reduced, consistent with the observation that cell-cycle arrest is lost during adaptation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage. This mechanism is likely conserved in S. cerevisiae, as the Rad53 FHA domains and Mec1 phosphorylation sites are similarly required for its hyperphosphorylation. The timing of adaptation onset correlated with the loss of Rad53 activity, suggesting that adaptation may be a consequence of Cdc5-mediated checkpoint inhibition.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of adaptation to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae, highlighting the role of Cdc5 in attenuating the DNA damage checkpoint. These findings have implications for our understanding of how cells adapt to DNA damage and how this process may be conserved in higher eukaryotes, where polo-like kinases have been shown to inhibit the checkpoint response after DNA damage.

    **Title:** A 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck Framework for Simulating Electrodiffusive Effects in the Extracellular Space of the Brain

    **Research Question:** Can a computational model based on biophysical principles and constraints accurately simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain on large spatiotemporal scales?

    **Methods:** We developed a 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework to explore electrodiffusive effects in the ECS. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on nanometer and nanosecond scales, enabling simulations on millimeter and second scales on a standard desktop computer.

    **Main Findings:** We used the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework in elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS.

    **Implications:** The 3-D KNP framework has the potential to be a valuable tool for exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression. By accurately simulating ion concentration dynamics and electrical potential on large spatiotemporal scales, this framework can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of these pathologies.

    **Conclusions:** The 3-D KNP framework is the first simulation framework capable of handling 3-D electrodiffusion in neuronal tissue at relatively large spatiotemporal scales without demanding excessive computer power. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using this framework to simulate long-term ECS ion-concentration dynamics (about 100 s) in a spatial region of about 1 mm3 on a standard desktop computer. We envision that future applications of the 3-D KNP framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.

    **Title:** Evaluating the Consequences of Delayed Control Responses to Dengue Epidemics: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the economic and public health implications of halting mosquito surveillance and research funding for vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and West Nile virus, in the United States?

    **Methods:** We employed a mathematical model to simulate the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment, specifically the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. We generated hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction and coupled the results with mosquito surveillance and case management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each response scenario.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. Specifically, our results indicate that delaying control responses translates into an exponential increase in both the number of human cases and health costs. The cumulative cost of a strategy with active surveillance and response of 2 was US$ 0.15 and US$1.1 million for 2003 and 2009 epidemics, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the critical importance of sustained mosquito surveillance and research funding for vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and West Nile virus. The proposed budget cut of $26.7 million from the CDC vector-borne diseases program could virtually paralyze surveillance and research activities, jeopardizing the capability of the existing health infrastructure for early detection of other exotic mosquito-transmitted pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** Our analysis provides a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. Our findings emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance, underscoring the importance of continued investment in this cost-effective preventive public health strategy.

    **Title:** Seroprevalence and Clinical Characteristics of Dengue Infection in a Hospital-Based Cohort of Children and Adults in Rural Western Nicaragua

    **Research Question:** What is the seroprevalence and clinical characteristics of dengue infection in a hospital-based cohort of children and adults with acute febrile illness in rural western Nicaragua?

    **Methods:** We conducted a prospective study of consecutive patients (n = 740) aged ≥ 1 year presenting with acute febrile illness at a hospital in rural western Nicaragua. We collected epidemiologic and clinical data, as well as acute and convalescent sera (2-4 weeks after onset of illness), and tested paired sera for dengue IgG and IgM and serotyped dengue virus using reverse transcriptase-PCR.

    **Main Findings:** We found that 63.5% (470/740) of patients were seropositive for dengue at enrollment, with seroprevalence increasing with age, reaching >90% in individuals over 20 years. Acute dengue (serotypes 1 and 2) was identified in 5.1% (38/740) of patients, with only 8.1% (3/37) of confirmed cases suspected clinically. The median duration of illness was shorter for those with PCR-positive dengue (2 days [IQR 2, 3]) compared to those without (4 days [IQR 2-7]).

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of dengue as a cause of fever in rural western Nicaragua, particularly among children and adults. The high seroprevalence of dengue in this population increases their risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic, which is transmitted by the same vector and has been associated with severe congenital infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that dengue is a significant and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural western Nicaragua. The high seroprevalence of dengue in this population underscores the need for improved surveillance, diagnosis, and control measures to mitigate the impact of dengue and other flavivirus infections in this region.

    **Title:** Identification of a Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase, NILR1, Essential for Plant-Parasitic Nematode-Induced PAMP-Triggered Immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying plant-parasitic nematode-induced PAMP-Triggered Immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis, and what is the role of the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, NILR1, in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of PTI in plant-nematode interactions. We used Arabidopsis thaliana as the model plant and identified a novel leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, NILR1, that is specifically regulated upon nematode infection. We generated loss-of-function mutants of NILR1 and tested their susceptibility to a broad category of nematodes.

    **Main Findings:** We show that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitors induce PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. We identified NILR1 as a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes. NILR1 loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes, indicating that NILR1 plays a critical role in plant defense against nematodes.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nematode interactions and identify NILR1 as a key player in PTI responses to nematodes. This discovery has significant implications for the development of novel strategies for nematode control in crop plants.

    **Conclusions:** To our knowledge, NILR1 is the first example of an immune receptor that is involved in the induction of basal immunity (PTI) in plants or animals in response to nematodes. The identification of NILR1 will provide new options for nematode control in crop plants and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nematode interactions.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Action of Miltefosine against Schistosoma mansoni: Exposure of Surface Antigens and Induction of Immune Response

    **Research Question:** What is the effect of miltefosine on the exposure of surface antigens in Schistosoma mansoni adult worms, and how does this impact the immune response against the parasite?

    **Methods:** In this study, we investigated the effect of miltefosine on S. mansoni adult worms in vitro, using an indirect immunofluorescence assay to examine the exposure of worm surface antigens. We also used western immunoblotting to identify antigenic targets in a homogenate extract of adult worms.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that miltefosine treatment of S. mansoni adult worms leads to the exposure of surface antigens, which are recognized by rabbit anti-S. mansoni adult worm homogenate and anti-S. mansoni infection antisera. We identified four proteins reacting with the antibodies in immunoblots: fructose-1,6 bisphosphate aldolase (SmFBPA), Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These antibodies were also found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induce immune agglutination of the parasites.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent, where the drug unmasks parasite surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection. The antigens involved in this molecular mechanism could have potential as intervention targets, and antibodies against these antigens may act to increase the drug's anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism of action of miltefosine against S. mansoni, highlighting the importance of surface antigens in the immune response against the parasite. Our findings have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against schistosomiasis, and suggest that miltefosine could be used in combination with other drugs to enhance its efficacy and reduce the risk of resistance. Further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of miltefosine and praziquantel on exposure of schistosome worm surface proteins.

    **Title:** Iron Acquisition from Host Ferritin by Bacillus cereus: A Novel Mechanism of Pathogenesis

    **Research Question:** How does Bacillus cereus, a human opportunistic pathogen, acquire iron from host ferritin, a 24-mer nanocage protein that stores thousands of iron atoms?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between the surface protein IlsA (Iron-regulated leucine rich surface protein type A) of Bacillus cereus and host ferritin using isothermal titration calorimetry, UV-vis kinetic data, and biochemical assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that IlsA binds to ferritin through direct interaction with the shell subunits, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. We also demonstrate that IlsA enhances iron release from ferritin, a process that involves the destabilization of the ferritin subunits. Furthermore, we found that the siderophore bacillibactin plays a crucial role in iron uptake from ferritin, as disruption of its production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and attenuates bacterial virulence in insects.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of iron acquisition in B. cereus, which involves the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. This mechanism highlights a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore, providing new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings propose a new model of iron mobilization from host ferritin in bacteria, where IlsA destabilizes the ferritin subunits, leading to an enhancement of iron release from the ferritin mineral core. The siderophore bacillibactin then acquires the mobilized iron needed for bacterial growth. Further studies are needed to determine whether the ability of IlsA to bind ferritin is a universally conserved feature of the composite NEAT-LRR proteins found in other pathogenic bacteria. The importance of this strategy is underscored by the effects of iron homeostasis disorders on both innate and acquired immune responses.

    **Title:** A Thermodynamically Consistent Model of the Kai Circadian Clock in Synechococcus elongatus

    **Research Question:** How is the circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus driven thermodynamically?

    **Methods:** We present a new statistical-mechanical model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock in S. elongatus, which is based on the idea that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain drives a conformational switch of KaiC. The model explicitly keeps track of the two phosphorylation sites on each of the monomers, as well as their nucleotide binding states.

    **Main Findings:** Our model shows that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise and an inactive one in which it tends to fall. Phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also naturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can stimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA for the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation.

    **Implications:** Our model provides a thermodynamically consistent explanation for how the Kai circadian clock is driven, shedding light on the long-standing question of how ATP turnover drives phosphorylation oscillations. The model also provides a framework for understanding how KaiA regulates the clock, and how the differential affinity of KaiA for the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the Kai circadian clock in S. elongatus is driven by a thermodynamically consistent mechanism, in which ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain drives a conformational switch of KaiC, and phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model provides a new understanding of the design principles of the Kai circadian clock and has implications for our understanding of circadian rhythms in general.

    **Title:** Hepatitis B Virus Suppresses Innate Immunity by Recruiting Parkin to Mitochondria and Disrupting MAVS Signaling

    **Background:** Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that establishes persistent infection by evading host immunity. Despite the activation of the RIG-I-MAVS axis by HBV pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA), the underlying mechanism explaining the suppression of interferon-αβ (IFN-β) synthesis remains uncharacterized.

    **Research Question:** How does HBV infection fail to induce IFN-β synthesis, despite the activation of the RIG-I-MAVS axis?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of parkin, a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the suppression of IFN-β synthesis during HBV infection.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that HBV-induced parkin recruits the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) to mitochondria, leading to the accumulation of unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS. This disrupts the MAVS signalosome and attenuates IRF3 activation, resulting in the suppression of IFN-β synthesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling, which involves the recruitment of LUBAC to mitochondria. This mechanism provides a molecular explanation for the suppression of IFN-β synthesis during HBV infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that parkin plays a critical role in the suppression of innate immunity during HBV infection by disrupting MAVS signaling. The recruitment of LUBAC to mitochondria by parkin leads to the disruption of MAVS-TRAF3 and TRIM25 interactions, resulting in the attenuation of IRF3 activation and IFN-β synthesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HBV-induced suppression of innate immunity and highlight the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in antiviral signaling. Our results also suggest that targeting parkin or LUBAC may be a potential therapeutic strategy to restore IFN-β synthesis and combat HBV infection.

    **Title:** Crystal Structure and Functional Analysis of pfiT, a T-Cell Superantigen Associated with Crohn's Disease

    **Research Question:** What is the crystal structure of pfiT, a T-cell superantigen encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, and how does it interact with human class II MHC molecules?

    **Methods:** We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of pfiT at 1.7Å resolution. We also performed functional analysis of the interaction of pfiT and its homolog, PA2885, with human class II MHC molecules.

    **Main Findings:** We found that both pfiT and PA2885 bound to mammalian cells and stimulated the proliferation of human lymphocytes. This binding was greatly inhibited by anti-class II MHC HLA-DR antibodies, and to a lesser extent, by anti-HLA-DQ and DP antibodies, indicating that the binding was class II MHC-specific. We also found that GST-pfiT efficiently precipitated both endogenous and in vitro purified recombinant HLA-DR1 molecules, indicating that pfiT directly interacted with HLA-DR1. Competition studies revealed that pfiT and the superantigen Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM) competed for binding to HLA-DR, indicating that their binding sites overlap.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that pfiT is a novel T-cell superantigen that plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The discovery of pfiT and its interaction with class II MHC molecules provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease.

    **Conclusions:** The crystal structure of pfiT reveals that it belongs to the TetR-family of DNA-binding transcription regulators. The distinct structure of pfiT indicates that it represents a new family of T-cell superantigens. Our findings have important implications for understanding the role of pfiT in Crohn's disease and for the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which pfiT contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.

    **Title:** Allelic Regulation of Nanog Expression Contributes to Stem Cell Population Heterogeneity

    **Research Question:** How does allelic regulation of Nanog expression influence the heterogeneity of stem cell populations in vivo and in vitro?

    **Methods:** A multiscale stochastic population balance equation framework was developed to investigate the effects of allelic control, gene expression noise, and random partitioning at cell division on the distribution of Nanog in stem cell populations.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that allelic control of Nanog expression resulted in three distinct states of Nanog distribution, which became bimodal when combined with transcriptional noise. Initially uniform populations of stem cells gave rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cell cycles, regardless of their allelic expression pattern. Depletion of NANOG content in cells switching off both gene alleles was slower than the accumulation of intracellular NANOG after cells turned on at least one of their Nanog gene copies, indicating Nanog state-dependent dynamics.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that allelic regulation of Nanog expression is a prime determinant of stem cell population heterogeneity. This mechanism may also influence the diverse presentation of other markers in stem cell populations. Furthermore, the use of stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in a single allelic locus may lead to significant divergence in the reporter and native protein profiles due to differences in half-lives and insertion of the reporter gene in one or both alleles.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of allelic control of Nanog expression in maintaining fractions of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nanog content to prevent aberrant loss of pluripotency. Our results warrant further investigation in the contexts of stem cell specification and cell reprogramming. The stochastic PBE model developed in this study is aligned with experimental findings on the allelic switching of Nanog expression and the heterogeneity of cells with single nanog allele deletion, underscoring the pivotal role of allelic regulation in stem cell population heterogeneity.

**Title:** Quantifying the Costs and Benefits of Unutilized Protein Expression in Escherichia coli

**Research Question:** What is the magnitude and variability of unutilized protein expression in Escherichia coli across different environments, and how does it impact cellular growth rates?

**Methods:** We combined absolute and global proteomics data with a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli to quantify the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per-gene basis. This approach allowed us to enumerate the unused proteome and quantify the cost of unused protein expression across 16 distinct environments.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains >95% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across these environments. We also found that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Classification of the unused protein revealed that it encodes several nutrient- and stress-preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that unused protein expression is a significant source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change. This has important implications for our understanding of the evolution and regulation of proteome expression in microbes.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the magnitude and variability of unutilized protein expression in Escherichia coli across different environments. By combining proteomics data with a genome-scale model, we were able to quantify the cost of unused protein expression and characterize the processes and regulators underlying its change across environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering the costs and benefits of protein synthesis on organismal fitness and provide new insights into the evolution and regulation of proteome expression in microbes.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Association Studies of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Diverse Asian Populations

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in Chinese, Malay, and Asian Indian populations, and how do these findings compare to previous studies in European populations?

    **Methods:** We conducted genome-wide association scans (GWAS) in 3,955 Chinese, 2,034 Malays, and 2,146 Asian Indians, comprising 2,010, 794, and 977 cases, respectively, and 1,945, 1,240, and 1,169 controls, respectively. We also performed a meta-analysis of the three studies to assess the transferability and relevance of previous findings from European populations.

    **Main Findings:** Our meta-analysis revealed strong associations at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci, which have consistently emerged in T2D studies in multiple global populations. However, we observed locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to the associations with T2D, as well as variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for most of these loci. The effect sizes in our Chinese and Indian populations were similar or even larger than those reported in European studies, despite comparable frequencies of the implicated alleles.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups to fine-map causal variants and identify population-specific variants associated with T2D. The availability of three GWAS scans across three genetically heterogeneous populations offers a unique opportunity to explore the genetic architecture underlying the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci, which showed the strongest evidence of association with T2D in more than one population and in our meta-analysis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the value of GWAS in identifying genetic variants associated with T2D in diverse populations and highlights the need for further research to understand the genetic etiology of T2D in non-European populations. The findings of this study contribute to the growing body of evidence that T2D is a complex disease influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, and underscore the importance of considering population-specific genetic variation in the search for novel therapeutic targets and prevention strategies.

    **Title:** Aurora B Kinase Ipl1 Regulates Nuclear Division in Cryptococcus neoformans through Spatio-Temporal Control of Microtubule Stability and Dynein Activity

    **Research Question:** How does the evolutionarily conserved Aurora B kinase Ipl1 regulate nuclear division in the basidiomycetous budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of live cell imaging, in silico modeling, and genetic manipulation to investigate the role of Ipl1 in nuclear division in C. neoformans.

    **Main Findings:** We show that Ipl1 localizes to the nucleus upon breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis and is essential for timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Ipl1 depletion results in compromised stability of cytoplasmic microtubules, leading to delayed kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Our in silico model predicts that cytoplasmic microtubules and cortical dyneins promote atypical nuclear division in C. neoformans, and that an effective cortical bias generated by cytosolic Bim1 and dynein regulates dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that Ipl1 plays a critical role in maintaining microtubule stability and regulating dynein activity to ensure timely onset of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C. neoformans.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 allows its own nuclear entry, which spatio-temporally influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear division in C. neoformans and highlight the importance of Ipl1 in regulating microtubule stability and dynein activity to ensure proper nuclear migration and chromosome segregation during mitosis.

    **Title:** Synonymous Mutations Can Drive Cancer Progression: A Novel Mechanism in Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma

    **Research Question:** Can synonymous mutations, previously thought to be clinically irrelevant, contribute to cancer progression in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)?

    **Methods:** We investigated a case of aggressive, apparently sporadic MTC harboring a somatic RET p.Cys634Arg mutation, a known MTC driver. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissues revealed that the RET mutations were in cis, with no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis found increased RET transcript levels in the patient compared to seven other MTCs harboring p.Cys634 mutations. Minigene expression assays demonstrated that the synonymous RET mutation was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level.

    **Main Findings:** In silico analyses and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the p.Cys630= variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhanced SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and an increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor.

    **Implications:** Our findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression, challenging the long-held assumption that these mutations are clinically irrelevant. This study highlights the importance of considering the functional consequences of synonymous mutations in cancer research.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that a synonymous mutation in the RET proto-oncogene can drive cancer progression in MTC by creating new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhance pre-mRNA maturation and increase the abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and suggest that synonymous mutations should not be dismissed as clinically irrelevant in cancer research.

    **Title:** Development of a Bioinformatics System for Eliminating Genomic Contamination in Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomes

    **Research Question:** How can we improve the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for the diagnosis of human infections by eliminating genomic contamination in eukaryotic pathogen genomes?

    **Methods:** We developed a bioinformatics system to remove contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this system to a comprehensive database of 245 eukaryotic pathogen genomes, identifying and removing human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complexity genomic sequences.

    **Main Findings:** Our system effectively eliminated contamination and low-complexity sequences, producing a database of "clean" eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrated that this new database provides better sensitivity and a dramatic reduction in false positives when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples compared to using the original genomes.

    **Implications:** The presence of contamination in published genomes has hindered the use of metagenomic sequencing for accurate diagnosis. Our system addresses this problem by providing a comprehensive and accurate database of eukaryotic pathogen genomes, which can be used to improve the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for the diagnosis of human infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study presents a new method for eliminating genomic contamination in eukaryotic pathogen genomes, which can be used on both complete and draft reference genomes. The resulting database of "clean" eukaryotic pathogen genomes is ready for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) diagnostics, with decreased false positive and false negative rates. Our system has the potential to revolutionize the field of metagenomic sequencing for the diagnosis of human infections by providing a more accurate and reliable method for identifying eukaryotic pathogens.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Evolutionary Dynamics of Human African Trypanosomiasis in Uganda: Insights into the Origin of New Foci and Host-Parasite Interactions

    **Research Question:** What are the evolutionary dynamics underlying the origin of new foci of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, and how do host species influence parasite genetic diversity in the region?

    **Methods:** We genotyped 269 Trypanosoma brucei isolates collected from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and screened for the presence of the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense. We used Bayesian clustering methods and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components to analyze the genetic relationships among the isolates.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal three distinct genetic clusters of T. brucei isolates, which are not sorted by subspecies designation, host, or date of collection. Clusters 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. We found evidence of genetic admixture among the three clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and possibly ongoing gene flow between them. Our analysis also shows that the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr). Furthermore, we confirm the emergence of human-infective strains (Tbr) from non-infective T. b. brucei (Tbb) strains of different genetic backgrounds, and the importance of cattle as Tbr reservoirs in shaping the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the control and management of HAT in Uganda. The identification of genetic clusters and gene flow between them highlights the need for targeted surveillance and control measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The emergence of human-infective strains from non-infective T. b. brucei strains also underscores the importance of monitoring the genetic diversity of T. brucei populations in the region.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of HAT in Uganda and highlights the complex interactions between host species and parasite genetic diversity in the region. Our findings have important implications for the control and management of HAT in Uganda and underscore the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of T. brucei populations in the region.

    **Title:** Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) regulates nitric oxide production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock

    **Research Question:** What is the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock?

    **Methods:** We used Txnip−/− mice and wild-type (WT) controls to investigate the role of TXNIP in LPS-induced endotoxic shock. We measured NO production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and IL-1β secretion in macrophages from Txnip−/− and WT mice. We also used an iNOS inhibitor to rescue Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Txnip−/− mice were significantly more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic shock due to increased NO production and iNOS expression. The absence of TXNIP led to increased S-nitrosylation of NLRP3, resulting in reduced IL-1β secretion. An iNOS inhibitor rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death, demonstrating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The interaction between TXNIP and the NF-κB/iNOS pathway may regulate disease states associated with sepsis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that TXNIP plays a critical role in regulating NO production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during LPS-induced endotoxic shock. The absence of TXNIP leads to excessive NO production, which inhibits NLRP3-dependent IL-1β secretion. These findings highlight the importance of TXNIP in modulating the inflammatory response and suggest that TXNIP may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis.

    Title: ZTF-8: A Novel Protein Involved in DNA Damage Response and Repair in the C. elegans Germline

    Research Question: What is the role of ZTF-8, a previously uncharacterized protein, in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the C. elegans germline?

    Methods: We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of ZTF-8 in the C. elegans germline. We generated ztf-8 mutants and analyzed their sensitivity to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, as well as their ability to activate the DNA damage checkpoint and repair DSBs.

    Main Findings: Our results show that ztf-8 mutants exhibit specific sensitivity to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic nuclear arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of the ATL-1 and CHK-1 DNA damage checkpoint kinases, and accumulation of both mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates. We also found that ZTF-8 partially co-localizes with the 9-1-1 DDR complex and interacts with MRT-2/Rad1, a component of this complex. Furthermore, we show that the human RHINO protein rescues the phenotypes observed in ztf-8 mutants, suggesting functional conservation across species.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that ZTF-8 plays a crucial role in promoting repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs, as well as in meiotic DNA damage checkpoint response via the 9-1-1 pathway. Impaired ZTF-8 function results in partially impaired activation of germ cell apoptosis, reduced brood size, and accumulation of RAD-51 foci.

    Conclusions: We propose that ZTF-8 is involved in promoting genomic stability in the germline by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway. Our study defines a conserved function for ZTF-8/RHINO in the repair of DSBs and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the C. elegans germline, and highlights the importance of understanding the molecular basis for DNA damage response and repair in the germline.

    **Title:** Olig2 Regulates Motor Neuron Differentiation by Repressing the Notch Signaling Pathway

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the rapid differentiation of motor neuron (MN) progenitors in the neural tube?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell transcriptomics to investigate the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs in the neural tube. Gene expression dynamics were reconstructed from these data to identify key regulators of MN differentiation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that the MN determinant Olig2 plays a pivotal role in regulating MN differentiation by repressing the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Notably, Olig2 directly represses Hes5 expression via a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus, restricting its expression in MN progenitors. Furthermore, we show that Notch signaling controls the transition between distinct phases of Olig2 expression by restraining Olig2 expression in MN progenitors.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate a tight coupling between the regulatory networks controlling patterning and neuronal differentiation in the neural tube. By modulating the Notch pathway, the Shh and retinoid-dependent induction of Olig2 not only specifies MN identity but also determines the rate at which these progenitors differentiate, imposing the distinctive kinetics of MN production.

    **Conclusions:** Our study establishes a mechanism by which neural patterning and neurogenesis intersect, revealing how Olig2 acts as a developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of neural development and the regulation of MN differentiation, and highlight the importance of Olig2 in controlling the transition between distinct phases of neural progenitor development. The discovery of Olig2's role in repressing the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5 provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying MN differentiation, and has important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Cross-reactive T cell responses mediate early clearance of antigenically novel influenza virus in nonhuman primates

    **Research Question:** Can cross-reactive T cell responses induced by prior infection with a seasonal human influenza virus protect against subsequent challenge with an antigenically novel influenza virus in nonhuman primates?

    **Methods:** We employed a translational nonhuman primate model to investigate the role of T cells in protecting against influenza. Five rhesus macaques were first infected with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate to "prime" cellular immunity. Four months later, these animals and seven naive controls were challenged with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm).

    **Main Findings:** In naive animals, CD8+ T cells with an activated phenotype appeared in blood and lung 5-7 days post-inoculation (p.i.) with H1N1pdm and reached peak magnitude 7-10 days p.i. In contrast, activated T cells were recruited to the lung as early as 2 days p.i. in "primed" animals, and reached peak frequencies in blood and lung 4-7 days p.i. Interferon (IFN)-γ Elispot and intracellular cytokine staining assays showed that the virus-specific response peaked earlier and reached a higher magnitude in "primed" animals than in naive animals. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in nonhuman primates. Vaccines capable of inducing such cross-reactive T cells may help protect humans against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that prior infection with a seasonal human influenza virus can induce strong T cell responses that are rapidly recalled and boosted in magnitude upon challenge with an antigenically novel influenza virus. These findings have important implications for the development of influenza vaccines that can provide broad protection against multiple viral subtypes.
Title: Development of a Rapid and Sensitive Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for the Detection of Coxiella burnetii in Humans and Domestic Animals

    Abstract:
    Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), is a widespread zoonotic disease with domestic animals serving as the primary source of transmission. Diagnosing C. burnetii infection is challenging due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations in humans and the absence of identifiable features in infected animals. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from the acute and convalescent stages of infection, which are often unavailable at early diagnosis. To address this limitation, we developed a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay to rapidly and sensitively detect C. burnetii.

    Methods:
    A universal LAMP primer set was designed to target the repeated sequence IS1111a of the htpAB gene of C. burnetii using PrimerExplorer V4 software. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was evaluated using known quantities of recombined reference plasmids containing the targeted genes. The specificity of the developed LAMP assay was determined using 26 members of the order Rickettsiae and 18 other common pathogens. The utility of the LAMP assay was further compared with real-time PCR by examining 24 blood samples, including 6 confirmed and 18 probable Q fever cases diagnosed by IFA serological assessment and real-time PCR. Additionally, 126 animal samples from 4 provinces were compared by these two methods.

    Main Findings:
    The LAMP assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 1 copy per reaction and a specificity of 100%, with no cross-reaction observed among the bacteria used in the study. The positive rate of unknown febrile patients was 33.3% (95% CI 30.2-36.4%) for the LAMP assay and 8.3% (95% CI 7.4-9.2%) for real-time PCR (P < 0.05). Similarly, the total positive rate of animals was 7.9% (95% CI 7.1-8.7%) for the LAMP assay and 0.8% (95% CI 0.7-0.9%) for real-time PCR (P < 0.01).

    Implications:
    The developed LAMP assay is a potential tool to support the diagnosis of Q fever in humans and domestic animals in the field, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without the aid of sophisticated equipment or complicated protocols.

    Conclusions:
    We developed a rapid, simple, sensitive, and cost-effective LAMP assay to detect C. burnetii infection in humans and domestic animals. Compared with real-time PCR, the LAMP assay is a potential tool for the diagnosis of Q fever in humans and animals in the field, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without the aid of sophisticated equipment or complicated operations.

    **Title:** Epigenetic Reprogramming of Hematopoietic Enhancers in Cancer Reveals Novel Regulatory Circuits

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms controlling gene expression programs in cancers that resemble those of undifferentiated cells, and how do these mechanisms contribute to cancer development?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional enhancers throughout hematopoietic cell development and derived cancers using DNA methylation data. We identified a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations, designated ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs), which are particularly enriched in the hematopoietic cell lineage.

    **Main Findings:** We found that hematopoietic ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, indicative of their chromatin activity states. Strikingly, ESSE methylation is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer. Methylated ESSEs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes, whereas unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive or hematopoietic stem cell-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESSEs in cancer.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer. We identified a novel regulatory circuit affecting VEGFA transcript levels across cancers and patients, which is associated with hypomethylation of an ESSE downstream to the VEGFA gene.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations, ESSEs, which are specifically prone to DNA methylation alterations in cancer. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms controlling gene expression programs in cancers that resemble those of undifferentiated cells, and highlight the importance of epigenetic reprogramming in cancer development. The discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer, which may have implications for the development of novel cancer therapies.

    **Title:** Subdivision Accelerates Fitness Valley and Plateau Crossing in Asexual Populations

    **Research Question:** How does population subdivision affect the time it takes for asexual populations to cross fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effect of subdividing an asexual population into equivalent demes connected by global migration on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau. We used a generic and minimal model that does not require significant size changes of the demes, environmental heterogeneity, or specific geographic structure.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that subdivision can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters. We found that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, we obtained analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved, demonstrating that valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is as fast as that of its fastest deme. We verified our analytical predictions through stochastic simulations.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus, shedding light onto the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur. This has important implications for understanding the evolution of subdivided populations in natural systems, where population subdivision is extremely common.

    **Conclusions:** Our results show that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters, extending beyond the optimal window. We also investigate the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. Our study provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of subdivision on evolution, which can help infer fitness landscape structure from evolution experiments.
Title: Elucidating the Midgut Metabolome of Aedes aegypti in Response to Dengue Virus Infection: Implications for Arbovirus Transmission

    Abstract:

    Background: Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. Understanding the metabolic environment within the midgut tissue of Aedes aegypti is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of viral replication and transmission.

    Research Question: What are the temporal metabolic perturbations that occur in the midgut tissue of Aedes aegypti following dengue virus infection?

    Methods: We employed high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolome of Aedes aegypti midgut tissue at early-, mid-, and late-infection time points following dengue virus infection.

    Main Findings: Our study revealed a dynamic-profile of metabolites across the infection time points, with a marked increase in lipid content, particularly glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls, coincident with the kinetics of viral replication. Elevated levels of glycerolipids suggested a diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways, while elevated acyl-carnitines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion of energy production. A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway, influencing dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios, was identified as critical for the virus life cycle.

    Implications: Our findings highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by Aedes aegypti, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti during dengue virus infection, shedding light on the metabolic environment that facilitates viral replication and transmission. The identification of key metabolic pathways and biochemical choke points offers promising avenues for the development of novel strategies to control arbovirus transmission.
Title: Elucidating the Underlying Mechanisms of Fatal Cardiac Arrhythmias: Development of a Parsimonious Rabbit Ventricular Action Potential Model

    Abstract:
    Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating a deeper understanding of the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms. Existing models of transmembrane action potential (AP) are complex and varied, leading to dissimilar predictions. To address this, we developed a parsimonious rabbit ventricular AP model that integrates a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization. Our model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic current-voltage relationships, rapid recovery of AP excitability, and steady-state INa inactivation. Simulations reproduced several emergent phenomena, including cellular alternans, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. Model variants revealed the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup, namely the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current (IK). Our parsimonious model provides a solid foundation for generating more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology, offering mechanistic insight into the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

    Research Question:
    What are the minimal physiological requirements for reproducing significant observable phenomena in rabbit ventricular action potential models?

    Methods:
    We developed a parsimonious rabbit ventricular AP model by combining a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of INa with a phenomenological model of repolarization. The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic current-voltage relationships, rapid recovery of AP excitability, and steady-state INa inactivation.

    Main Findings:
    Our simulations reproduced several emergent phenomena, including cellular alternans, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. Model variants revealed the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup, namely the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK.

    Implications:
    Our parsimonious model provides a solid foundation for generating more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology, offering mechanistic insight into the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The simplicity of the model and the fact that its parameters have physiological meaning make it ideal for engendering generalizable mechanistic insight.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates the development of a parsimonious rabbit ventricular AP model that integrates a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of INa with a phenomenological model of repolarization. The model provides a solid foundation for generating more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology, offering mechanistic insight into the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

    Title: **Precise Genome Assembly in Paramecium: The Role of Ligase IV and Xrcc4p in Developmentally Programmed IES Excision**

    Background: The ciliate Paramecium undergoes a complex sexual cycle, during which tens of thousands of short, non-coding germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences or IESs) are precisely excised from the somatic genome. This process involves the introduction of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are initiated by the domesticated transposase PiggyMac.

    Research Question: How does Paramecium process DSBs to achieve the precise assembly of somatic genes?

    Methods: We investigated the molecular steps and actors involved in the final and precise assembly of somatic genes in Paramecium. We used RNAi-mediated silencing of Lig4 and Xrcc4 genes, which are core components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, to examine their role in IES excision.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that Lig4p and Xrcc4p are essential for the repair of IES excision sites and the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early during the sexual cycle, and a Lig4p-GFP fusion protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. RNAi-mediated silencing of either gene results in the persistence of free broken DNA ends, which are protected against extensive resection.

    Implications: Our data indicate that IES excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism, which involves the introduction of initiating double-strand cleavages at both ends of each IES, followed by DSB repair via highly precise end joining. This work broadens our current view on how the cellular NHEJ pathway has cooperated with domesticated transposases for the emergence of new mechanisms involved in genome dynamics.

    Conclusions: Our study provides strong evidence that the Lig4p-Xrcc4p complex, a key actor of the NHEJ pathway, carries out DSB repair during developmentally programmed IES excision in Paramecium. The precise assembly of somatic genes is critical for the emergence of new mechanisms involved in genome dynamics, and our findings highlight the importance of tight coupling between DNA cutting and repair in achieving this precision.

    Title: Mode of Death in Patients with Chagas Heart Disease: A Comparative Study with Non-Chagas Cardiomyopathy

    Research Question: What is the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, and how does it compare to non-Chagas cardiomyopathy?

    Methods: This study analyzed data from the REMADHE trial, a prospective cohort study of patients with heart failure. Patients were grouped according to etiology (Chagas vs. non-Chagas) and mode of death. The primary endpoint was all-cause, heart failure, and sudden death mortality. A total of 342 patients were analyzed, and 185 (54.1%) died.

    Main Findings: The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In the Cox regression model, Chagas etiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), creatinine clearance, and use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality. LVEDD and use of beta-blocker were independently associated with sudden death mortality.

    Implications: These findings challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and suggest that progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death in severe Chagas heart disease. The results may have implications for the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, comparing it to non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. The findings suggest that Chagas patients have a higher risk of heart failure mortality, but not sudden death mortality, compared to non-Chagas patients. These results have important implications for the management and treatment of Chagas heart disease, and highlight the need for further research to better understand the natural history of this disease.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanism of NIK1-Mediated Defense Response against Geminivirus Infection

    **Research Question:** How does the NSP-interacting kinase (NIK) receptor-mediated defense pathway respond to geminivirus infection, and what is the role of the ribosomal protein rpL10A in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including transient expression assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and subcellular localization studies, to investigate the interaction between NIK1 and rpL10A in response to geminivirus infection.

    **Main Findings:** We identified rpL10A as a specific partner and substrate of NIK1 that functions as an immediate downstream effector of NIK1-mediated response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rpL10A by NIK1 redirects the protein to the nucleus, where it may act to modulate viral infection. Our results show that ectopic expression of normal NIK1 or a hyperactive NIK1 mutant promotes the accumulation of phosphorylated rpL10A within the nuclei, while an inactive NIK1 mutant fails to redirect the protein to the nuclei of co-transfected cells. Furthermore, we found that loss of rpL10A function enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection, resembling the phenotype of nik1 null alleles.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the NIK1-mediated defense signaling pathway is a virulence target of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) and that rpL10A plays a crucial role in this process. We also provide evidence that geminivirus infection directly interferes with NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure. However, the NIK1-mediated defense signaling neither activates RNA silencing nor promotes a hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth and development.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel defense signaling pathway that is targeted by the bipartite geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP). While the virulence function of the particular geminivirus NSP studied here overcomes this layer of defense in Arabidopsis, the NIK1-mediated signaling response may be involved in restricting the host range of other viruses. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of NIK1-mediated defense response against geminivirus infection and highlight the importance of rpL10A in this process.

    Title: Alternative Oxidase Plays a Crucial Role in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Survival and Virulence

    Background: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a life-threatening disease in humans. The survival of P. brasiliensis inside the host depends on its ability to adapt to different conditions, including oxidative stress imposed by immune cells.

    Research Question: What is the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in the survival and virulence of P. brasiliensis during host-pathogen interaction?

    Methods: We generated a mitotically stable P. brasiliensis AOX (PbAOX) antisense RNA (aRNA) strain with a 70% reduction in gene expression. We evaluated the relevance of PbAOX during interaction of conidia and yeast cells with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. We also determined the fungal cell's viability and PbAOX in the presence of H2O2.

    Main Findings: Interaction with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages induced higher levels of PbAOX gene expression in PbWt conidia than PbWt yeast cells. PbAOX-aRNA conidia and yeast cells had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages. In a mouse model of infection, we showed that absence of wild-type levels of PbAOX in P. brasiliensis results in a reduced fungal burden in lungs at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and an increased survival rate. In the presence of H2O2, we observed that PbWt yeast cells increased PbAOX expression and presented a higher viability in comparison with PbAOX-aRNA yeast cells.

    Implications: These data further support the hypothesis that PbAOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P. brasiliensis.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that PbAOX plays a crucial role in the survival and virulence of P. brasiliensis during host-pathogen interaction. The absence of wild-type levels of PbAOX in P. brasiliensis results in reduced fungal burden and increased survival rate in a mouse model of infection. These findings highlight the importance of PbAOX in the pathogenicity of P. brasiliensis and suggest that targeting PbAOX could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Attractor Dynamics in Context-Dependent Memory: A Neural Network Model of CA3 Place Cells

    **Background:** Episodic-like memory is thought to be supported by attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, where the spatial map of place cells encodes contextual information through firing rate variability. Recent experiments have shown that memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells, but the neural substrate for this memory mechanism remains unclear.

    **Research Question:** Can context-dependent memory be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells?

    **Methods:** We developed a neural network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts to investigate the role of attractor dynamics in rate remapping. We used a recurrent neural network model of hippocampal area CA3, where each position in the environment was represented by a group of CA3 units. External synaptic input from medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) entorhinal cortices carried information about rat position and external sensory cues (context), respectively.

    **Main Findings:** Our model showed that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. Smooth transition curves arose from averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels, consistent with experimental observations.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells. This mechanism may also be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex. The findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of episodic-like memory and the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus.

    **Conclusions:** Our neural network model provides a framework for understanding the neural substrate of context-dependent memory and the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus. The results suggest that overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells may support context-dependent memory, and that similar mechanisms may be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the neural basis of episodic-like memory and the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus.

    **Title:** Unveiling Metabolic Anti-Oxidative Defense Strategies in Entamoeba histolytica

    **Research Question:** How does Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerophilic enteric protozoan parasite, respond metabolically to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection?

    **Methods:** We employed capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to investigate the global metabolic responses of E. histolytica trophozoites exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and paraquat (PQ)-mediated oxidative stress.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that oxidative stress caused a drastic modulation of metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, we observed the inhibition of glycolysis due to inactivation of key enzymes, leading to the redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, we identified the presence of a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica, which was upregulated in response to oxidative stress.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that E. histolytica employs alternative anti-oxidative defense strategies, including the glycerol biosynthetic pathway, to cope with oxidative stress. The repression of glycolysis and redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production may serve as a protective mechanism against oxidative damage. The presence of a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica highlights its significance as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the metabolic responses of E. histolytica to oxidative stress, shedding light on the parasite's anti-oxidative defense mechanisms. Our findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of amebic colitis and extra-intestinal abscesses caused by E. histolytica, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the glycerol biosynthetic pathway.

    **Title:** IKAROS Regulates Hematopoiesis by Recruiting the NuRD-P-TEFb Complex to Gene Regulatory Regions

    **Research Question:** How does IKAROS, a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate, support transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing NuRD complex?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of IKAROS in recruiting the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and its impact on transcription elongation in hematopoietic cells.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that IKAROS binds to the NuRD complex and the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) at gene promoters, forming a complex that can be recruited to specific genes. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions, facilitating transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α) to CDK9. We also show that an IKAROS mutant unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impairs normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal that IKAROS is the DNA-binding subunit of the newly characterized NuRD-P-TEFb multifunctional complex, which contains chromatin remodeling (NuRD) and gene transcription elongation (P-TEFb) activities. IKAROS is essential for CDK9 and Mi2 interaction and combined recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematopoietic cells.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide mechanistic insights into the central role played by IKAROS as a transcriptional activator during hematopoietic lineage decision, differentiation, and interaction with the niche. The dynamic interaction of IKAROS with the NuRD-P-TEFb complex depends on IKAROS protein levels, with low levels sufficient for Mi2/NuRD recruitment to promoters, but higher levels required for NuRD-P-TEFb and PP1α to chromatin, CDK9/P-TEFb activation, and productive transcription elongation. Our study highlights the importance of IKAROS-PP1α protein interaction for normal hematopoietic differentiation of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Title: Molecular Characterization and Phylogeographic Analysis of Trinidadian Rabies Virus Reveals Multiple Introductions from the South American Mainland

    Abstract:
    Background: Bat rabies is an emerging disease of public health significance in the Americas, with the Caribbean island of Trinidad experiencing periodic outbreaks within the livestock population. We investigated the molecular characterization and phylogeographic origins of Trinidadian rabies virus (RABV) to determine the extent to which outbreaks are a result of in situ evolution versus importation of virus from the nearby South American mainland.

    Methods: We performed molecular characterization of Trinidadian RABV sequences obtained from rabid livestock sampled between 1997 and 2010. We used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate the relationships between Trinidadian RABV sequences and those from the South American mainland.

    Main Findings: Trinidadian RABV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat)-related sequences. The sequences fell into two largely temporally defined lineages, designated Trinidad I and II, which were most closely related to RABV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela. Phylogeographic analyses supported three separate RABV introductions from the mainland, from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that RABV outbreaks in Trinidad are likely the result of multiple introductions from the South American mainland, rather than in situ evolution. The co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000 highlights the dynamic nature of RABV spatiotemporal dynamics in Trinidad. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, particularly any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the molecular characterization and phylogeographic origins of Trinidadian RABV, highlighting the importance of understanding the complex dynamics of RABV transmission in the Americas. Our findings emphasize the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of RABV in Trinidad and the surrounding regions to inform public health policy and control measures.

    **Title:** Computational Modeling Reveals Design Principles of Gene Network Regulating Cortical Area Development

    **Research Question:** What are the regulatory interactions between Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8 that lead to their confinement to particular spatial patterns in the developing cerebral cortex?

    **Methods:** We employed a computational model to simulate gene expression patterns created by all possible networks containing the five genes of interest. The model treated expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the expression data available. We analyzed the performance of each network and identified those that reproduced the experimentally observed expression patterns.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that only a subset of networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks lacked certain interactions and combinations of interactions, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. We found that repressive interactions were more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops were not critical for correct network functioning.

    **Implications:** Our study provides novel insights into the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development. The results suggest that the network is more complex than previously thought, with multiple feedback pathways and differing roles for each gene. The findings also indicate that Fgf8 expression at the anterior pole may be sufficient to drive the correct spatial patterning of the transcription factors Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8, if simple interactions between these transcription factors exist.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational model illuminates the regulatory interactions between Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8 that lead to their confinement to particular spatial patterns in the developing cerebral cortex. The study provides a framework for understanding the gene network regulating cortical area development and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. The results highlight the importance of repressive interactions in the network and suggest that mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying cortical area development and provides a foundation for future research in this area.
Title: Genome-Wide Profiling of Bmi1-Dependent H2A Ubiquitylation Reveals Novel Insights into Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression

    Abstract:
    The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a crucial role in regulating organism development by controlling the expression of developmental genes. Bmi1, a key component of the PRC1 complex, has been shown to be essential for H2A ubiquitylation. However, the genome-wide localization of Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation (uH2A) remains poorly understood. Here, we employed ChIP-Seq technology to map the genome-wide distribution of Bmi1-dependent uH2A in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Our results reveal a peak of uH2A just inside the transcription start site (TSS) of well-annotated genes, which is enriched at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark and represents the least expressed genes in wild-type MEF cells. Furthermore, we found that genes with promoter peaks of uH2A exhibit lower-level expression compared to genes without uH2A peaks. Notably, local enrichment of uH2A is not limited to regions containing the H3K27me3 mark, and we observed enrichment of H2A ubiquitylation at high-density CpG promoters. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at these regions. Importantly, we demonstrate that genes with uH2A peaks have increased expression upon Bmi1 knockout, indicating that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is a repressive mark. These results provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and suggest that uH2A targeting in differentiated cells may employ a different mechanism from that in embryonic stem cells.

    Research Question:
    What is the genome-wide distribution of Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation (uH2A) in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells?

    Methods:
    We employed ChIP-Seq technology to map the genome-wide distribution of Bmi1-dependent uH2A in MEF cells.

    Main Findings:
    Our results reveal a peak of uH2A just inside the TSS of well-annotated genes, which is enriched at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark and represents the least expressed genes in wild-type MEF cells. Genes with promoter peaks of uH2A exhibit lower-level expression compared to genes without uH2A peaks. Local enrichment of uH2A is not limited to regions containing the H3K27me3 mark, and we observed enrichment of H2A ubiquitylation at high-density CpG promoters.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is a repressive mark and that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at high-density CpG promoters. These results provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and suggest that uH2A targeting in differentiated cells may employ a different mechanism from that in embryonic stem cells.

    Conclusions:
    Our study reveals the genome-wide distribution of Bmi1-dependent uH2A in MEF cells and provides novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Our findings suggest that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is a repressive mark and that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at high-density CpG promoters. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying uH2A targeting in differentiated cells.

    **Title:** Regulation of Alveolar Development by Pregnancy-Induced Noncoding RNA (PINC) in the Mammary Gland

    **Research Question:** What is the functional role of pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) in regulating alveolar development in the mammary gland, and does it interact with retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RbAp46) to maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the expression and function of mPINC in the post-pubertal mouse mammary gland. We performed in situ hybridization to verify the cell-type specificity of mPINC expression, and used HC11 mammary epithelial cells to study the effects of mPINC overexpression and knockdown on lactogenic differentiation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mPINC is highly expressed in luminal and alveolar progenitors during pregnancy and declines in early lactation, coinciding with terminal differentiation of alveolar cells. Overexpression of mPINC in HC11 cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of mPINC enhances differentiation. We also demonstrate that mPINC interacts with RbAp46 and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify potential targets of mPINC that are differentially expressed following modulation of mPINC expression levels.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that mPINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition. The PRC2 complex that includes mPINC and RbAp46 may confer epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for a functional role of mPINC in regulating alveolar development in the mammary gland, and highlights the importance of mPINC and RbAp46 in maintaining a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate. These findings have implications for our understanding of mammary gland development and lactation, and may provide insights into the regulation of cell fate decisions in other tissues.

    **Title:** PML/TRIM19 Restricts Retroviral Infection through Daxx-Mediated Inhibition of Reverse-Transcription

    **Research Question:** How does PML/TRIM19, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, contribute to the antiviral defense against HIV-1 and other retroviruses?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of PML/TRIM19 in antiviral defense against HIV-1 and other retroviruses using a combination of biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology approaches, including immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, and reverse-transcription assays.

    **Main Findings:** We show that HIV-1 and other retroviruses trigger the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies as early as 30 minutes post-infection. PML re-localization is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors and is not observed following infection with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PML knockdown dramatically increases reverse-transcription efficiency, indicating that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel antiviral function for PML/TRIM19, which acts through the stabilization of Daxx, a well-characterized partner protein. Daxx is shown to inhibit reverse-transcription and retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, identifying it as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription.

    **Conclusions:** Our study unravels a novel antiviral mechanism by which PML/TRIM19 restricts retroviral infection through Daxx-mediated inhibition of reverse-transcription. These findings highlight the importance of PML/TRIM19 and Daxx in antiviral defense and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying retroviral restriction. The identification of Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription has significant implications for the development of novel antiviral therapies against HIV-1 and other retroviruses.

    **Title:** Multiple Protein Structure Alignment with Geometric Flexibility: The Matt Algorithm

    **Research Question:** Can a protein structure alignment algorithm that incorporates geometric flexibility improve the accuracy of multiple protein structure alignments, particularly for distantly homologous proteins?

    **Methods:** We introduce the Matt (Multiple Alignment with Translations and Twists) algorithm, an aligned fragment pair chaining algorithm that temporarily allows local flexibility between fragments during the alignment process. This flexibility is achieved through small translations and rotations that bring sets of aligned fragments closer, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body transformations. After a dynamic programming assembly guided by these "bent" alignments, geometric consistency is restored in the final step before the alignment is output.

    **Main Findings:** We tested Matt against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the popular Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. Matt's global performance was competitive with other programs on Homstrad, but outperformed them on SABmark, a benchmark of multiple structure alignments of proteins with more distant homology. Notably, Matt demonstrated an ability to better align the ends of α-helices and β-strands, an important characteristic of any structure alignment program intended to help construct a structural template library for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that incorporating geometric flexibility into protein structure alignment algorithms can improve their accuracy, particularly for distantly homologous proteins. This is likely due to Matt's ability to model proteins in different conformational states and backbone distortions, which are common in distantly related proteins.

    **Conclusions:** We postulate that Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and its ability to model backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins. Our results have implications for the development of structural template libraries for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem and for the identification of distantly homologous protein structures. The Matt algorithm and its structural alignments are available for download at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/matt and http://matt.cs.tufts.edu.

    Title: Elucidating the Phosphatase Network Regulating Greatwall Kinase and Cdk1 Substrate Phosphorylation during Mitotic Entry and Exit

    Research Question: What is the dynamic regulation of Greatwall kinase activity and the phosphatases that control Greatwall kinase and its substrates during mitotic entry and exit?

    Methods: We employed a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments using phospho-specific antibodies to monitor Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrate phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit in mammalian cells.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that PP2A/B55 is required for Gwl dephosphorylation at the essential Cdk site Thr194, while Ensa/ARPP19 dephosphorylation is mediated by the RNA Polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of neither Fcp1 nor PP2A appears to block dephosphorylation of the bulk of mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit.

    Implications: Our findings suggest a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit. Moreover, the reactivation of these phosphatases is likely to be a crucial element during mitotic exit.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the dynamic regulation of Greatwall kinase activity and the phosphatases that control Greatwall kinase and its substrates during mitotic entry and exit. Our results indicate that the network of phosphatases that counteract Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk phosphorylation during mitotic exit is more complex than previously thought, with multiple phosphatases contributing to Gwl inactivation and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the regulation of mitotic entry and exit, and highlight the importance of further research into the phosphatase network controlling these critical cellular processes.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of HIV-1 Escape from Autologous Neutralizing Antibodies in Acute/Early Subtype C Infection

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape from autologous neutralizing antibodies (Nab) in acute/early subtype C infection?

    **Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study of two subjects with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection who developed high-titer autologous Nab. We isolated Nab-resistant variants at multiple time points and created envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants to elucidate the escape pathways.

    **Main Findings:** We found that viral escape occurred despite the development of high-titer autologous Nab in both subjects. In one subject, escape was driven predominantly by changes in the V3V5 region of gp120, while in the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. Notably, the V1V2-dependent escape pathway in the second subject was retained over time and allowed the virus to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and that multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape from autologous Nab in acute/early subtype C infection. Our findings support a model in which the HIV-1 subtype C Env is uniquely equipped to respond to the current immune response of each individual host by adjusting its pathways of escape. These results have important implications for the development of an HIV vaccine that can elicit neutralizing antibodies capable of limiting replication of genetically diverse viruses and preventing establishment of a new infection. Further studies are needed to recover and characterize individual Mabs with different specificities to derive a complete picture of autologous Nab and escape.

    **Title:** Widespread Positive and Negative Selection in Plant Genomes: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Capsella grandiflora

    **Research Question:** To what extent do positive and negative selection vary across different portions of plant genomes, particularly in coding and noncoding regions?

    **Methods:** We sequenced the whole genomes of 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals and quantified the amount of selection across the genome using an estimate of the distribution of fitness effects. We also analyzed expression data from leaf tissue to investigate the relationship between gene expression and selection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). However, estimates of selection on noncoding regions conserved across the Brassicaceae family reveal strong signals of selection. We also observed reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Furthermore, we found that genes with higher expression levels experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding genome function and the maintenance of genetic variation in plants. The widespread presence of positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions suggests that these regions are under strong functional constraint. In contrast, our results also suggest that both positive and negative selection on plant noncoding sequence are considerably rarer than in animal genomes.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first genome-wide analysis of selection in a plant species and highlights the importance of considering both coding and noncoding regions in understanding the evolution of plant genomes. Our results demonstrate that positive and negative selection are pervasive in plant genomes, but also reveal that a large proportion of noncoding DNA may evolve neutrally. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of plant genomes and the maintenance of genetic variation in plant populations.

    **Title:** EBNA2-Driven Reprogramming of Host Transcription Factors to Establish EBV-Induced B-Lymphoblast Growth and Survival

    **Background:** Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transforms resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can give rise to malignancies. EBV-encoded transcriptional regulator EBNA2 plays a crucial role in this process.

    **Research Question:** How does EBNA2 reprogram host transcription factors to drive EBV-induced B-lymphoblast growth and survival?

    **Methods:** We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and biochemical studies to investigate the genome-wide binding patterns of EBNA2, RBP-jκ, and EBF1 in EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines.

    **Main Findings:** We found that EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding sites for RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with transcriptional activation of linked genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal that EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival. We also show that EBV type III latency promotes a B-cell marginal zone developmental program, as the number of RBP-jκ binding sites is largely increased.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the EBV-encoded transcriptional co-activator EBNA2 reprograms the chromosome binding patterns of host master regulatory transcription factors RBP-jκ and EBF1, leading to the establishment of EBV-induced B-lymphoblast growth and survival. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying EBV-induced B-cell transformation and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against EBV-associated malignancies.

    **Title:** Geographic Barriers to Gene Flow and Vector Competence in Aedes aegypti Populations in Mexico

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between geographic barriers to gene flow and vector competence for dengue virus (DENV) in Aedes aegypti populations in Mexico?

    **Methods:** We conducted a population genetic and vector competence study of Aedes aegypti populations in Mexico, focusing on the intersection of the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) with the Gulf of Mexico coast in the state of Veracruz. We collected 10 Ae. aegypti populations between Tuxpan in the north and Minatitlan in the south and phenotyped them for vector competence for DENV2.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the NVA acts as a discrete barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA. We found significant differences in vector competence (VC) for DENV2 between populations north and south of the NVA, with an average VC rate of 0.55 for mosquitoes from populations north of the NVA and 0.20 for mosquitoes from populations south of the NVA. Most of this variation was attributable to midgut infection and escape barriers.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that barriers to gene flow in vector populations may impact the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. The low VC of Ae. aegypti populations south of the NVA may contribute to the low dengue incidence in some areas, such as Moloacan, where the seroprevalence rate was zero.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between geographic barriers to gene flow and vector competence in Aedes aegypti populations. Further studies are warranted to determine why the NVA is a barrier to gene flow and to determine whether the differences in vector competence seen north and south of the NVA are stable and epidemiologically significant. This research has important implications for the development of targeted control efforts to prevent dengue epidemics in areas at greatest risk.

    Title: Unraveling the Timing of Replication Initiation in E. coli: The Role of DnaA Protein

    Background: The bacterial replication cycle is driven by the DnaA protein, which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form. It has been proposed that DnaA is the main controller of initiation frequency, with initiation occurring when enough ATP-DnaA has accumulated.

    Research Question: Does the accumulation of ATP-DnaA control the timing of replication initiation in E. coli?

    Methods: We performed cell cycle analysis of E. coli cells with a surplus of ATP-DnaA to investigate whether initiation occurs earlier in these cells.

    Main Findings: Our results show that cells with more than a 50% increase in the concentration of ATP-DnaA did not exhibit changes in the timing of replication initiation. This suggests that the accumulation of ATP-DnaA does not control the timing of initiation.

    Implications: Our findings indicate that while ATP-DnaA is the motor that drives the initiation process, other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. We propose that E. coli has a robust replication cycle driven by the cycling of the levels of ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA, and that initiation cannot occur unless sufficient amounts of ATP-DnaA at oriC have licensed this event.

    Conclusions: Our results argue that the DnaA protein, although it constitutes the key feature of the cell cycle motor, is not the limiting factor for precise timing of initiation of replication. Instead, other mechanisms, such as origin sequestration, inactivation of DnaA, and inhibition of dnaA transcription, ensure that extra initiation events do not occur. We propose that signals depending on the cell's environment govern the exact timing of initiation, and that the frequency of replication must match the growth rate to maintain cellular DNA concentration.

**Title:** Unveiling Oscillatory Interactions in Biological Systems: A Novel Approach to Partial Granger Causality Analysis

**Research Question:** How can we reliably identify interaction patterns in multivariate biological data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain?

**Methods:** We introduce a novel approach, partial Granger causality, to analyze oscillatory activity in biological systems. This method is extensively tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data from HeLa cell cycle, in vivo multi-electrode array (MEA) local field potentials (LFPs) from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and in vivo LFPs from distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey.

**Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that partial Granger causality can reliably reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. We show that an ad hoc definition of causality, such as partial directed coherence (PDC), can be misleading and yield contradicting results between the time and frequency domains. Our analysis of LFP data from a macaque monkey performing a GO/NO-GO visual pattern discrimination task reveals oscillatory field potential activity in the beta (14–30 Hz) frequency range in the sensorimotor cortex during the prestimulus period.

**Implications:** Our novel approach to partial Granger causality analysis has significant implications for understanding oscillatory interactions in biological systems. By accounting for exogenous inputs and latent variables, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics underlying biological processes. This approach can be applied to a wide range of biological systems, from subcellular to whole-organism levels.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering exogenous inputs and latent variables when analyzing oscillatory activity in biological systems. The partial Granger causality approach introduced here provides a reliable and transparent method for identifying interaction patterns in multivariate data in the frequency domain. By applying this approach to experimental datasets, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics underlying biological processes and shed light on the critical role of oscillatory activity in regulating biological systems.
Title: Accurate and Efficient Local Ancestry Inference in Admixed Genomes using Continent-Specific Variants

    Abstract:
    Local ancestry inference is a crucial aspect of medical and population genetics, enabling the identification of disease-risk loci, recombination rates, and missing contigs in the human genome. However, existing methods for local ancestry inference are often designed for genotyping arrays and fail to utilize the full spectrum of data available from sequencing. Here, we present a novel approach that leverages continent-specific variants (CSVs) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of local ancestry inference in fully sequenced admixed genomes. Our method, termed Lanc-CSV, incorporates the admixed genomes jointly with public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, to enhance the accuracy of CSV calling. We demonstrate through simulations that Lanc-CSV attains accuracy comparable to computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with significant reductions in runtime. Furthermore, we show that our method recovers comparable local ancestries to the 1000 Genomes consensus local ancestry calls in real admixed individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Notably, we extend our approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and demonstrate that accurate local ancestry inference can be achieved at low sequencing coverage. Additionally, we generalize CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs) and show that it is possible to determine sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments based on sCSVs. Our results highlight the potential of Lanc-CSV as a powerful tool for local ancestry inference in fully sequenced admixed genomes, with significant implications for medical and population genetics research.

    Research Question:
    Can a novel approach leveraging continent-specific variants (CSVs) improve the accuracy and efficiency of local ancestry inference in fully sequenced admixed genomes?

    Methods:
    We developed a new method, Lanc-CSV, which incorporates the admixed genomes jointly with public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, to enhance the accuracy of CSV calling. We used simulations to evaluate the performance of Lanc-CSV and compared it to widely used computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches. We also extended our approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and generalized CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs).

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Lanc-CSV attains accuracy comparable to computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with significant reductions in runtime. We also demonstrate that our method recovers comparable local ancestries to the 1000 Genomes consensus local ancestry calls in real admixed individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Furthermore, we show that accurate local ancestry inference can be achieved at low sequencing coverage and that sCSVs can be used to determine sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for medical and population genetics research, enabling the identification of disease-risk loci, recombination rates, and missing contigs in the human genome. The ability to accurately infer local ancestry in fully sequenced admixed genomes will facilitate the development of personalized medicine and improve our understanding of population dynamics.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our novel approach, Lanc-CSV, offers a powerful tool for local ancestry inference in fully sequenced admixed genomes. By leveraging continent-specific variants (CSVs) and sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs), our method provides accurate and efficient local ancestry inference, with significant implications for medical and population genetics research.

    **Title:** Enhanced Detection of Circadian Oscillations in Gene Expression using Digital Signal Processing

    **Research Question:** Can digital signal processing algorithms be used to identify circadian oscillations in gene expression across a wide range of genes, overcoming the limitations of traditional statistical analyses?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel approach that applies digital signal processing algorithms to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, in addition to traditional statistical tests for periodicity. This method allows for the identification of circadian baseline oscillation in nearly 100% of all expressed genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that almost all genes exhibit circadian oscillations in their expression levels, suggesting that oscillation is a fundamental feature of biological pathways. The application of digital signal processing algorithms enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, enabling the detection of circadian oscillations in genes that were previously undetectable using traditional methods.

    **Implications:** The widespread presence of circadian oscillations in gene expression has significant implications for our understanding of biological pathways and their regulation. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or environmental factors, such as photic stimuli or feeding, should be considered in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of digital signal processing in identifying circadian oscillations in gene expression across a wide range of genes. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of circadian biology and provide new insights into the regulation of biological pathways. By considering the oscillatory nature of gene expression, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions within biological systems and the effects of perturbations on these systems. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases related to circadian rhythm disorders. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating circadian oscillations in gene expression in any study related to biological pathways, and we propose that this approach should become a standard practice in the field.

    **Title:** High-Resolution Mapping of Recombination Events in the Collared Flycatcher Reveals Insights into the Avian Recombination Landscape

    **Research Question:** What is the detailed portrait of the recombination landscape in an avian system, and how does it impact sequence evolution at a local scale?

    **Methods:** We performed whole-genome re-sequencing at high coverage of a complete three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree to localize recombination events with high resolution.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 325 crossovers at a median resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% of events localized to <10 kb intervals. Observed crossover rates were 52% higher in male (3.56 cM/Mb) than in female meiosis (2.28 cM/Mb), and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female meiosis. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome, with several distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions, particularly in promoters and CpG islands. We also identified 267 non-crossovers, whose location was significantly associated with crossover locations. Furthermore, we detected a significant transmission bias (0.18) in favor of'strong' (G, C) over 'weak' (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing direct evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a high-resolution portrait of the recombination landscape in an avian system, shedding light on how recombination impacts sequence evolution at a local scale. The approach taken in this study should be applicable to any species, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the recombination landscape across organism groups.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that recombination events are non-randomly distributed in the genome, with distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions. The significant transmission bias in favor of'strong' alleles at non-crossover events provides direct evidence for GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution mapping of recombination events in understanding the recombination landscape and its impact on sequence evolution.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Folding Landscape of Repeat-Proteins: A Quasi-One-Dimensional Approach

    **Research Question:** How can the folding properties of repeat-proteins be described and predicted using a quasi-one-dimensional model, taking into account the inherent symmetries in their primary sequence and three-dimensional structure?

    **Methods:** We employed a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, which are treated as spin variables. This approach allowed us to derive the overall folding properties of a complete "domain" (stability and cooperativity of the repeating array) from a microscopic description of the energy balance within each folding element and its interactions with its neighbors.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the one-dimensional nature of the model implies simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy (ΔGwater) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value), which do not apply for globular proteins. We demonstrated how the parameters for the "coarse-grained" description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. A case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins was presented, and the results were quantitatively related to the experimentally observed folding transitions.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that natural repeat-proteins are "poised" at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions. The quasi-one-dimensional model provides a general description of the energy landscape of repeat-proteins, which can help appreciate their biological function.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a novel approach to understanding the folding properties of repeat-proteins, which can be used to predict the global folding properties of these proteins. The Ising-like description of the energy landscape of repeat-proteins can be obtained from a more fundamental model based on perfectly funneled energy landscapes, and the parameters of the description follow to a first approximation from the protein topology. This work has significant implications for understanding the folding behavior of repeat-proteins and their biological functions.

    **Title:** CHOP Promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Regulating Inflammation, Fibrosis, and Cell Death

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the integrated stress response (ISR)-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of CHOP in human HCC tumors and two mouse models of HCC. We also generated Chop-null mice to study the effects of CHOP deletion on liver cancer development.

    **Main Findings:** We found that CHOP expression is up-regulated in liver tumors in human HCC and two mouse models thereof. Chop-null mice were resistant to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and exhibited attenuation of apoptosis and cellular proliferation. These mice also showed reduced fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Global gene expression profiling revealed that deletion of CHOP reduced basal inflammatory signaling in the liver.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that CHOP contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. These findings implicate CHOP as a common contributing factor in the development of HCC in a variety of chronic liver diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that CHOP promotes liver cancer. We propose a stepwise model of HCC development, where CHOP expression leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. Understanding the mechanisms by which CHOP promotes oncogenesis will have implications for other cancers beyond HCC. Our results reveal an unexpected molecular link between hepatocarcinogenesis and the stimuli that predispose to it, suggesting additional points for potential therapeutic intervention in HCC.
Title: Systematic Review of Treatment Outcomes for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Caused by Leishmania aethiopica in Ethiopia: A Call for High-Quality Clinical Trials

    Abstract:

    Background: Leishmania aethiopica is the primary causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia, resulting in severe and complicated cases such as diffuse CL (DCL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, or extensive CL, necessitating systemic treatment. Despite the substantial burden, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking.

    Research Question: What are the most effective treatment options for CL caused by L. aethiopica in Ethiopia, and what are the implications for clinical practice and future research?

    Methods: A systematic review of clinical studies reporting on treatment outcomes of CL due to L. aethiopica was conducted to identify potentially efficacious medications for CL that can be taken forward for clinical trials. A total of 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL presumably due to L. aethiopica were identified.

    Main Findings: The most commonly used drugs were antimonials (n = 201), pentamidine (n = 150), and cryotherapy (n = 103). However, all studies suffered from methodological limitations, and only two small and/or poor-quality randomized controlled trials were identified. Cryotherapy showed cure rates of 60-80%, and antimonials showed cure rates of 69-85%. Pentamidine appeared effective against complicated CL, including cases non-responsive to antimonials. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin, and liposomal amphotericin B are extremely scarce.

    Implications: The evidence-base for treatment of complicated CL due to L. aethiopica is extremely limited. While antimonials remain the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, their efficacy and safety in CL should be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality trials on CL due to L. aethiopica are urgently needed, exploring group sequential methods to evaluate several options in parallel.

    Conclusions: The current evidence-base for treatment of CL due to L. aethiopica is inadequate, warranting prospective clinical studies. Antimonials may remain the cornerstone of CL treatment for the time being due to their availability and clinical experience within Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety in CL should be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments should be explored, preferably topically or orally.

    **Title:** Reconstituting a Biochemical Oscillator: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Circadian Rhythms

    **Research Question:** Can a biochemical oscillator be reconstituted in vitro with three purified proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) that displays the salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-h periodicity that is temperature-compensated?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the biochemical basis of this oscillator by quantifying the time-dependent interactions of the three proteins using electron microscopy (EM) and native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to elucidate the timing of the formation of complexes among the Kai proteins. We also used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to confirm monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation in vitro is accompanied by rhythmic association patterns among the KaiA/KaiB/KaiC proteins. EM and BN-PAGE analyses revealed a mixture of various macromolecular assemblies formed by the three Kai proteins at each phase of the in vitro oscillation. We found that KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC interact with each other and modulate the status of KaiC phosphorylation, leading to the formation of complexes whose composition oscillates over the circadian cycle.

    **Implications:** Our dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator accurately reproduces the rhythms of KaiABC complexes and KaiC phosphorylation, and is consistent with biophysical observations of individual Kai protein interactions. The model suggests that the function of monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers may be to maintain synchrony among the KaiC hexamers in the reaction, thereby sustaining a high-amplitude oscillation over multiple days.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides an unprecedented level of molecular detail to the analysis of a circadian clockwork. Our results demonstrate that a biochemical oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro with three purified proteins that displays the salient properties of circadian rhythms. The dynamic model derived from our data provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillations and has implications for understanding the regulation of circadian clocks in living organisms. Furthermore, our perturbation experiments using temperature pulses demonstrate that this unique circadian oscillator can be reset by stimuli that are well known to entrain circadian clocks.

    **Title:** Investigating the Inverted-U Relationship between Trial-to-Trial Brain Activity and Behavioral Performance: Evidence from Human Electrocorticography

    **Research Question:** Do trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity exhibit an inverted-U relationship with behavioral performance, independent of trial-averaged activity?

    **Methods:** We employed electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients undergoing invasive brain monitoring for neurosurgical treatment to investigate the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual stimulus detection task.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate a significant inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in broadband ECoG activity and behavioral performance. Specifically, we found that when the raw fluctuation in ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times are faster. Importantly, this relationship is present not only in post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics.

    **Implications:** Our findings support the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and are consistent with attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance. The proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance. Our results also suggest that variability reduction can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance, independent of trial-averaged activity. Our findings have implications for our understanding of brain function and behavior, and highlight the importance of considering both deterministic and stochastic sources of brain variability. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship and its implications for brain function and behavior.

    **Title:** Convergent Evolution of Fused Mating-Type Loci in Basidiomycetes: A Comparative Analysis of Trichosporonales and Pathogenic Cryptococci

    **Research Question:** What is the evolutionary history of mating-type loci in the Trichosporonales, a sister order to the Tremellales, and how do they compare to the pathogenic Cryptococci?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the mating-type (MAT) loci from 24 species of Trichosporonales, a sister order to the Tremellales, and compared them to the MAT loci of pathogenic Cryptococci.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the MAT loci in Trichosporonales are fused, with a single homeodomain transcription factor gene (HD) present in each mating type, similar to the organization in pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the HD and pheromone/receptor (P/R) allele combinations in Trichosporonales are distinct from those in pathogenic Cryptococci. This suggests that the fusion of HD and P/R loci occurred independently in Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci, supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of mating-type loci in fungi. The conservation of gene content and gene order within the fused MAT loci in Trichosporonales, but not in other basidiomycete lineages, suggests different mechanisms for the evolution of physically linked MAT loci in these groups.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for convergent evolution of fused MAT loci in Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of mating-type loci evolution in fungi. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution of genomic regions involved in mating and mating-type determination, and have important implications for the study of fungal evolution and mating systems.

**Title:** Mathematical Modeling of Non-Domiciliated Vector Abundance and Evaluation of Control Strategies for Chagas Disease

**Research Question:** Can a mathematical model accurately predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors and evaluate the efficacy of control strategies for Chagas disease in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico?

**Methods:** A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses. The model was fitted to two years of field data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, and its predictive value was tested on an independent data set. The model was then used to examine the efficacy of control strategies based on residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets.

**Main Findings:** The model accurately fitted and predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found to be effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season, resulting in an >80% reduction in bug abundance. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate.

**Implications:** The results suggest that control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, which would require yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of mathematical modeling to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors and evaluate the efficacy of control strategies for Chagas disease. The findings highlight the limitations of insecticide spraying as a control strategy and suggest that insect screens may be a more effective and sustainable alternative. These results have important implications for the development of integrated control strategies for Chagas disease and other vector-borne diseases in Latin America.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Mechanisms of Avian Feather Patterning: A Reaction-Diffusion-Taxis System Integrated with Mechanical Processes

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the precise patterning of feathers in avian skin during embryonic development?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology, cell biology, and developmental biology techniques to investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, mesenchymal cell movement, and mechanical processes in feather patterning. We analyzed the expression of key genes, including FGF20, Ectodysplasin A (EDA), and EDAR, in chicken, duck, ostrich, and emu embryos.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the patterning of feathers relies on a coupled FGF and BMP signaling system, acting in a coordinated reaction-diffusion-taxis system. This system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, mechanically compressing the epidermis to rapidly intensify FGF20 expression. The traveling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of EDA, which initiates the expression of FGF20. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying avian feather patterning. The reaction-diffusion-taxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the feather array in flighted birds. The key role of the EDA/EDAR pathway in vertebrate skin patterning has been recast to activate this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered pattern formation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that the feather periodic patterning system relies on epithelial FGF to attract mesenchymal cells to form an aggregate, explaining why the absence of FGF20 in the scaleless mutant leads to a failure of feather primordium formation. We propose that the high-cell-density dependence for feather development more likely rests on a need for rapid mesenchymal cell condensation and stabilization of FGF20 expression than on distinct individual cell phenotypes in dense and loose mesenchyme.
Title: Systematic Review of Filovirus Presence in Body Fluids of Infected Individuals and Survivors: Implications for Disease Transmission

Abstract:

Background: The 2013-2015 Ebola outbreak highlighted the need for a better understanding of filovirus transmission dynamics, particularly in urban environments. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) noted a lack of evidence on which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans.

Objectives: To conduct a rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected individuals and survivors.

Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, Scopus, and grey literature was conducted using the string "filovir*. af. OR ebola. af. OR ebolavir*. af OR Marburg-virus. af" without restrictions for date or language. Eligible infections were from Marburg virus species and Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest, and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. Primary data suggesting high likelihood of actively infectious virus in human body fluids (viral RNA) were extracted and summarized narratively.

Results: A total of 6831 unique articles were identified, and 33 studies were eligible for inclusion. Most body fluid types had insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken >16 days after onset were usually negative. RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient.

Implications: The findings suggest that contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission due to the known high viral loads in blood. Non-blood, RT-PCR-positive samples are likely to be culture-negative and possibly of low infectious risk. However, the relative infectiousness of many body fluids during or after illness is unclear, even when culture-positive, due to the predominance of test results from more severe cases.

Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the need for further research on filovirus transmission dynamics, particularly in urban environments. The findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids as the primary risk factor for disease transmission. Future studies should aim to investigate the relative infectiousness of different body fluids and the duration of viral shedding in survivors.

    **Title:** A Fractional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model for Power-Law Dynamics in Neuronal Activity

    **Research Question:** Can a fractional derivative-based model capture the power-law behavior and long-range correlations in neuronal activity that arise from correlated membrane conductances?

    **Methods:** We developed and analyzed a fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, where the exponent of the fractional derivative can vary from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the normal derivative. The model integrates a temporal weighted voltage trace, also called the memory trace, to determine the value of the variable.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the fractional model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations found experimentally in neocortical pyramidal cells and tectal neurons in vitro. The model also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with power-law distribution. Furthermore, the fractional model generates reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input and captures the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation.

    **Implications:** The fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model provides a unified mathematical and computational framework for describing power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity. This model can capture relationships between the distribution of conductances that are complicated to model using explicit techniques. The emergent effect of these membrane correlations is a non-Markovian process that can be modeled with a fractional derivative.

    **Conclusions:** Our results suggest that the value of the exponent of the fractional derivative has to be low to reproduce the spike timing adaptation observed experimentally. The fractional model exhibits spike adaptation with power-law dynamics by integrating all the past voltage values without any additional adaptation currents. Power-law functions generalize the mechanism underlying exponential processes and are better alternatives to describe scale-invariant spike adaptation. Overall, the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model deviates from the spiking activity of the Markovian model and reflects the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation.

    **Title:** Superoxide Dismutases in Paracoccidioides spp.: Unveiling the Role of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 in Host-Pathogen Interaction

    **Research Question:** How do Paracoccidioides spp. defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host effector cells, and what is the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in this process?

    **Methods:** We identified six SOD isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and determined gene expression levels of representative isolates of the phylogenetic lineages of Paracoccidioides spp. (S1, PS2, PS3, and Pb01-like) using quantitative RT-PCR. We analyzed SOD gene expression in yeast cells, mycelia cells, the mycelia-to-yeast transition, and yeast-to-mycelia germination, as well as under treatment with oxidative agents and during interaction with phagocytic cells.

    **Main Findings:** We observed increased expression of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 during the transition process, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with phagocytic cells, suggesting that these proteins assist in combating superoxide radicals generated during host-pathogen interaction. Using PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 knockdown strains, we showed that these genes are involved in the response of the fungus against host effector cells, particularly the oxidative stress response, and in a mouse model of infection. Protein sequence analysis and functional analysis of knockdown strains suggest that PbSOD3 expression is linked to extracellular activity, while PbSOD1 is more related to intracellular requirements of the fungus.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that Paracoccidioides actively responds to ROS generated endogenously during metabolism and counteracts the oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing the expression of SOD isoforms. This study highlights the importance of SODs in the antioxidant response of Paracoccidioides spp. and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the host-pathogen interaction.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 play a crucial role in the antioxidant response of Paracoccidioides spp. against ROS produced by host effector cells. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the host-pathogen interaction and has implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Paracoccidioidomycosis.

    **Title:** Chaperone Binding to Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: A Protective Mechanism Against Degradation

    **Background:** Intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins (IDPs) are highly susceptible to proteolysis in vitro, yet exhibit no enhanced degradation rates in vivo. This paradox can be resolved if IDPs are preferentially associated with chaperones in the cell, which may offer protection against degradation by proteases.

    **Research Question:** Does predicted disorder correlate with chaperone binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa species?

    **Methods:** We analyzed pairwise interaction data from high-throughput interaction studies to investigate the relationship between predicted disorder and chaperone binding.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis reveals a negative correlation between predicted disorder and chaperone binding across E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa species. This suggests that IDPs tend to avoid binding to chaperones. Furthermore, we found that IDPs that bind chaperones also tend to bind other proteins, indicating that chaperone binding may promote assembly with partners rather than facilitate folding.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that chaperone binding is primarily required for the folding of globular proteins, as reflected in an increased preference for chaperones of proteins with at least one Pfam domain. In contrast, the functional consequence of chaperone binding to mostly disordered proteins is likely the promotion of assembly with partners.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that IDPs tend to avoid binding to chaperones, and that chaperone binding to IDPs is often accompanied by binding to other proteins. This suggests that IDPs use chaperones not for folding, but for assistance with association with other proteins. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the role of chaperones in protein folding and assembly, and highlight the importance of considering the functional consequences of chaperone binding to IDPs.

    Title: Elucidating the Genetic Control of Wing Imaginal Disc Growth and Patterning by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) Signalling Pathway

    Research Question: How do the Drosophila genes spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr) regulate cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning in the wing imaginal disc through the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signalling pathway?

    Methods: We employed a combination of microarray experiments, in situ hybridization, and loss-of-function phenotypic analysis to identify direct Salm and Salr target genes in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc.

    Main Findings: Our results reveal a complex transcriptional landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins in the wing disc, comprising both activated and repressed genes. We identified a collection of candidate Salm/Salr target genes whose expression is significantly altered in salm/salr knockdown wing discs. Notably, these targets include both genes whose expression is turned off and genes whose expression is positively regulated by Salm/Salr.

    Implications: The identification of Salm/Salr target genes provides crucial insights into the genetic hierarchy acting downstream of Dpp signalling in the wing disc. Our findings suggest that the Spalt proteins play a central role in mediating the effects of Dpp signalling, regulating cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning in the wing disc.

    Conclusions: This study reconstructs the genetic cascade initiated by Dpp signalling that acts through the Spalt transcription factors to control the growth and patterning of the central region of the wing disc. Our analysis reveals an unsuspected complexity in the transcriptional landscape regulated by Salm/Salr, consisting of batteries of activated and repressed genes. The identification of Salm/Salr target genes opens a new avenue to understand the genetic control of wing development and provides a framework for further investigation into the mechanisms of Dpp signalling in the wing imaginal disc.

    **Title:** Regulation of Centriole Duplication by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** How does Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulate centriole duplication in Caenorhabditis elegans, and what are the consequences of its dysregulation?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of PP1 in regulating centriole duplication in C. elegans embryos. We identified two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators, I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22, as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels, which is essential for centriole duplication.

    **Main Findings:** We found that down-regulation of PP1 activity, either directly or through mutation of szy-2 or sds-22, rescues the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, indicating that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. Furthermore, moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication to a zyg-1 mutant, while strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification via the production of more than one daughter centriole.

    **Implications:** Our results define a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle and highlight the critical role of PP1 in regulating centriole duplication. Dysregulation of PP1 activity can lead to centriole over-duplication, which is associated with tumorigenesis and microcephaly in humans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of centriole duplication in C. elegans and identifies PP1 as a critical regulator of ZYG-1 levels. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying centriole dysregulation in human diseases and suggest that modulating PP1 activity may impact centriole duplication.

    **Title:** Investigating Visceral Leishmaniasis Transmission in an Urban Environment: A Cross-Sectional Study in Campinas, Brazil

    **Research Question:** What is the role of wildlife in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in an urban environment, specifically in the municipality of Campinas, Brazil?

    **Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in the municipality of Campinas, Brazil, to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular tools and serological techniques.

    **Main Findings:** Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola. Additionally, natural infection by L. (L.) infantum and Leishmania subgenus Viannia was detected in two white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of each sampling of infected animals were plotted on a map of the Environmental Protection Area (EPA), demonstrating proximity between these animals, human residences, including the dogs positive for VL, and forest areas.

    **Implications:** The presence of natural infection by L. (L.) infantum in female sand flies and natural infection by two Leishmania species in a mammal species considered to be a potential reservoir (D. albiventris) provides strong evidence that sylvatic Leishmania transmission cycle is occurring in the EPA. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios, i.e., wild areas that undergo environmental modifications, is evident.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of considering the role of wildlife in the transmission of VL in urban environments. The findings suggest that the EPA, which is inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus. Different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included to elaborate prevention and control measures that consider the particularities of each transmission area.

    **Title:** Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded MicroRNA miR-BART9 Promotes Migration and Invasion of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells by Targeting E-Cadherin

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded microRNA miR-BART9 in the migration and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells?

    **Methods:** We employed gain- and loss-of-function approaches to investigate the effect of miR-BART9 in EBV-negative and EBV-positive NPC cells. We used TaqMan-based qPCR to determine the absolute level of miR-BART9 expression in NPC tissues and conducted luciferase assays to evaluate the activity of miR-BART9.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that miR-BART9 promotes the migration and invasiveness of cultured NPC cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Computational analysis revealed that miR-BART9 targets E-cadherin, a membrane protein crucial for maintaining cell-cell junctions and the epithelial phenotype. Biochemical assays and functional rescue analysis confirmed that miR-BART9 specifically inhibits E-cadherin to induce a mesenchymal-like phenotype and promote the migration of NPC cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that miR-BART9 is a prometastatic viral miRNA that contributes to the aggressiveness of NPC cells. The high abundance of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC tumors, coupled with the down-modulation of cellular levels of miR-200 family members, may drive epithelial carcinoma cells to adopt a mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced motility and contribute to the highly metastatic behavior of NPC tumors.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the critical role of miR-BART9 in promoting the migration and invasion of NPC cells by targeting E-cadherin. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive behavior of NPC tumors and suggest that miR-BART9 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of EBV-positive NPC.

Title: ggsashimi: A Novel Command-Line Tool for Visualizing Splicing Events Across Multiple Samples

Background: The visualization of splicing events is crucial for understanding alternative splicing from RNA-seq experiments. However, current implementations of sashimi plots are limited by their dependence on specialized annotation formats and inability to handle large genomic regions.

Research Question: Can a novel command-line tool, ggsashimi, effectively visualize splicing events across multiple samples, addressing the limitations of existing tools?

Methods: ggsashimi is a Python-based tool that generates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments and aggregated plots for groups of experiments. It uses popular bioinformatics file formats and is annotation-independent, allowing for the visualization of splicing events even for large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites.

Main Findings: We compared ggsashimi with the sashimi-plot built-in available within the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and found that ggsashimi provides a more effective visualization of splicing events, particularly when aggregating samples belonging to the same group and shrinking intron lengths. Our implementation eliminates the need for specialized annotation formats and supports summarized views for hundreds of samples.

Implications: ggsashimi addresses the limitations of current sashimi plot implementations, making it a valuable tool for researchers studying alternative splicing from RNA-seq experiments. Its ability to visualize splicing events across multiple samples and large genomic regions will facilitate the discovery of novel splicing events and improve our understanding of gene regulation.

Conclusions: ggsashimi is a novel command-line tool that effectively visualizes splicing events across multiple samples, addressing the limitations of existing tools. Its annotation-independent design, use of popular bioinformatics file formats, and ability to handle large genomic regions make it a valuable resource for researchers studying alternative splicing from RNA-seq experiments. ggsashimi is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi and is implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis (EMMA): A Novel Approach for Cross-Species Comparison of Cis-regulatory Modules

    **Research Question:** How can we develop a comprehensive model of cis-regulatory module (CRM) evolution that captures different modes of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and background sequences, and use this model to improve CRM alignment and prediction?

    **Methods:** We propose a probabilistic model of CRM evolution that explicitly treats the special properties of CRM sequences, including substitutions and indels in background sequences, and constraints and turnover of TFBSs. Our model is an extension of statistical alignment to the analysis of cis-regulatory sequences, integrating the binding site evolution model with the model of insertions and deletions. We developed a computational framework, EMMA (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis), that uses this model to solve the problems of CRM alignment and prediction.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that our program, EMMA, is able to improve both alignment and prediction of CRM sequences over several state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real data. Furthermore, we used alignments produced by EMMA to study binding site conservation in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in the Drosophila blastoderm, revealing two intriguing results: (i) factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm, and (ii) binding sites in distal bound sequences tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions.

    **Implications:** Our approach provides a novel framework for cross-species comparison of CRMs, enabling the identification of conserved regulatory elements and the study of their evolution. This has important implications for understanding the evolution of gene regulation and the conservation of regulatory sequences across species.

    **Conclusions:** Our work addresses the limitations of existing models of DNA sequence evolution by providing a comprehensive model of CRM evolution that captures different modes of evolution of TFBSs and background sequences. The EMMA program is a powerful tool for CRM alignment and prediction, and its application to genome-wide binding data reveals new insights into the evolution of regulatory sequences.

    **Title:** Novel Functions of the Drosophila piRNA Pathway in Genome Integrity and Telomere Protection

    **Research Question:** What are the roles of the Drosophila piRNA pathway genes in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection during embryonic development?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the functions of the Drosophila piRNA pathway genes, including armi, aub, ago3, rhi, and lig-IV, in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mutations in the piRNA pathway genes armi, aub, ago3, and rhi lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during the cleavage stage of embryonic divisions. Additionally, we found that aub and armi mutations disrupt telomere resolution during meiosis and the cleavage divisions, and that mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homologous end joining, suppress these fusions. By contrast, lig-IV mutations enhance chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that aub and armi mutations disrupt telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduce expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs.

    **Implications:** Our findings uncover genetically separable functions for the Drosophila piRNA pathway. The aub, armi, rhi, and ago3 genes silence transposons and maintain chromosome integrity during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions. However, the aub and armi genes have an additional function in assembly of the telomere protection complex.

    **Conclusions:** Our studies reveal a novel function for a subset of piRNA genes in assembly of the telomere protection complex, and suggest that this process is directed by a subpopulation of 19–22 nt piRNAs. This function requires aub, armi, rhi, and ago3, which are also required for wild-type piRNA production. Our findings provide new insights into the complex roles of the piRNA pathway in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection during embryonic development.

    **Title:** Discovery of a Novel Ebolavirus Species, Bundibugyo Ebolavirus, Associated with a Large Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Western Uganda

    **Research Question:** What is the identity and characterization of the novel ebolavirus species responsible for a large hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda?

    **Methods:** Laboratory investigation of 29 suspect-case blood specimens was conducted using classic methods (antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA) and a recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing approach. A broadly reactive ebolavirus antigen capture assay and an IgM capture assay based on Zaire ebolavirus reagents were used to detect evidence of acute ebolavirus infection.

    **Main Findings:** The novel ebolavirus species, proposed name Bundibugyo ebolavirus, was identified as the causative agent of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Bundibugyo ebolavirus is distantly related to Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, despite the large geographic distance between the two countries of origin. The case fatality rate associated with Bundibugyo ebolavirus infection was approximately 36%, which is lower than that observed for Zaire ebolavirus (80-90%) and Sudan ebolavirus (50-55%).

    **Implications:** The discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus has significant implications for the design of future diagnostic assays to monitor Ebola hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and animals, as well as ongoing efforts to develop effective antivirals and vaccines. Current human prototype ebolavirus vaccines, which include Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, may not provide cross-protection against Bundibugyo ebolavirus, highlighting the need for cross-protection studies. Additionally, the unique nature of this virus has implications for screening of potential antivirals and pathogenicity studies.

    **Conclusions:** The identification of Bundibugyo ebolavirus as the causative agent of a large hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda highlights the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of ebolavirus species in Africa. Further studies are necessary to compare the pathogenicity of Bundibugyo ebolavirus with other ebolavirus species and to assess the efficacy of current vaccines and antivirals against this novel virus.
Title: Quantifying Heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s Disease Progression: A Longitudinal Analysis of GDS/FAST Stage Durations

    Abstract:

    Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, characterized by a wide range of progression rates among patients. Despite its clinical significance, the degree of heterogeneity in AD progression remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed statistical analysis to reconstruct Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)/Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) stage durations in a cohort of 648 AD patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years. Our results reveal large variations in the duration of GDS/FAST stages 4-6, with standard deviations comparable to their mean values. This finding suggests that AD progression is characterized by significant heterogeneity, consistent with the existence of multiple subgroups of patients with distinct patterns of decline. Our study provides a quantitative measure of AD progression rates and their variances, essential for evaluating the results of clinical studies. These findings have important implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies and highlight the need for further research into the underlying factors contributing to AD heterogeneity.

    Methods:

    We analyzed a large longitudinal dataset of 648 AD patients, with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years. We used statistical analysis to reconstruct GDS/FAST stage durations and calculated the standard deviations for stages 4-6.

    Main Findings:

    Our results show that the standard deviations for GDS/FAST stage durations are comparable to their mean values, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients. This finding is consistent with the existence of multiple subgroups of AD patients with distinct patterns of decline.

    Implications:

    Our study provides a quantitative measure of AD progression rates and their variances, essential for evaluating the results of clinical studies. The large heterogeneity in AD progression has important implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies and highlights the need for further research into the underlying factors contributing to AD heterogeneity.

    Conclusions:

    Our study demonstrates that AD progression is characterized by significant heterogeneity, consistent with the existence of multiple subgroups of patients with distinct patterns of decline. These findings have important implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies and highlight the need for further research into the underlying factors contributing to AD heterogeneity.

    **Title:** Adaptive Neurogenesis in Hippocampal Memory Circuits: A Comparative Analysis of Plasticity Strategies

    **Research Question:** How do different adaptation strategies, including conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis, influence the performance of hippocampal memory circuits in response to changing input statistics and spatially driven input firing patterns?

    **Methods:** We extended our previous model of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We compared network performance across a sequence of spatial environments using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results confirm that additive neurogenesis is a superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns. We also show that a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells has an overall performance significantly better than any one of the three individual strategies operating alone. This adaptation rule can be tailored to maximize performance of the network when operating as either a short- or long-term memory store.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide strong theoretical arguments for why additive neurogenesis should be observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, as it endows the network with the ability to adapt in a way that is not possible with conventional plasticity or neuronal turnover. Our results also suggest that a more sophisticated neurogenesis rule that incorporates both cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells is superior to any one of the three individual strategies operating alone.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of additive neurogenesis in hippocampal memory circuits, particularly in response to changing input statistics and spatially driven input firing patterns. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the role of neurogenesis in the hippocampus and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders associated with impaired hippocampal function.

    **Title:** Cytosolic Trypanothione/Tryparedoxin-Dependent Peroxidases Protect the Lysosome from Iron-Induced Membrane Peroxidation in Bloodstream African Trypanosomes

    **Research Question:** What is the primary site of oxidative damage in bloodstream African trypanosomes, and how do cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases protect the cell from oxidative stress?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical, microscopic, and in vivo experiments to investigate the role of cytosolic and mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase (Px) enzymes in bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei. We generated knockout parasites lacking Px I, Px II, or Px III and analyzed their proliferation, lipid peroxidation, and lysosomal integrity in the presence or absence of the antioxidant Trolox.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage in bloodstream African trypanosomes, and that cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases (Px I and Px II) are essential for protecting the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation. In contrast, mitochondrial Px III is dispensable for parasite survival in vivo. We also found that the lysosome disintegrates before mitochondrial damage occurs, and that iron acquisition via endocytosis of host transferrin is linked to the high endocytic rate of bloodstream trypanosomes.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel function of cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases in protecting the lysosome from oxidative damage, which is essential for the survival of bloodstream African trypanosomes. This process is closely linked to the high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage of T. brucei.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our data demonstrate that the lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage in bloodstream African trypanosomes, and that cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases play a crucial role in protecting the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the redox biology of African trypanosomes and may provide new targets for the development of antitrypanosomal therapies.

    **Title:** Essential Role of PMEL in Eumelanin Production and Melanosome Morphology in Mammals

    **Research Question:** What is the role of PMEL in eumelanin production and melanosome morphology in mammals?

    **Methods:** We generated a mouse line in which the Pmel gene was inactivated (Pmel−/−) to investigate the function of PMEL in eumelanin production and melanosome morphology.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Pmel−/− mice are fully viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects. However, melanosomes within Pmel−/− melanocytes are spherical in contrast to the oblong shape present in wild-type animals. This feature was observed in primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes, retinal pigment epithelium cells, and uveal melanocytes. Inactivation of Pmel had a mild effect on the coat color phenotype in four different genetic backgrounds, with the clearest effect in mice also carrying the brown/Tyrp1 mutation.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that PMEL is essential for the normal development of rod-shaped melanosomes in eumelanin-producing melanocytes in hair, skin, and eye, but not for the general survival of pigment cells in several tissues. The amyloid fibrils formed by proteolytic fragments of PMEL play a critical role in generating the characteristic rod-shape of melanosomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of PMEL in eumelanin production and melanosome morphology in mammals. The mild effect of Pmel inactivation on visible pigmentation suggests that other previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation are likely dominant-negative mutations. Our results also suggest that PMEL has a critical role in maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation, and that the polymerization of eumelanins on PMEL fibrils may facilitate melanin transfer to keratinocytes. Overall, our study provides new insights into the function of PMEL and its role in melanosome morphology and eumelanin production in mammals.

    Title: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Environmental Methods for Dengue Vector Control

    Background: Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern worldwide, with vector control being the primary method of prevention. Environmental interventions offer a sustainable and safe approach to controlling dengue vectors, with minimal risks of environmental contamination and toxicity.

    Research Question: What is the effectiveness of environmental methods for dengue vector control, including container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites?

    Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Quality assessment was done using the CONSORT 2010 checklist. The difference-in-differences (DID) and difference-of-endlines (DOE) methods were used to calculate the Breteau index (BI) and pupae per person index (PPI) for the meta-analysis.

    Main Findings: Nineteen studies were eligible for the systematic review, with sixteen contributing data to the meta-analysis. The results showed that all environmental methods evaluated had some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, study quality was a major issue, with most studies assessed as low or medium quality. The meta-analysis revealed that container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection achieved the strongest reductions for the BI, while container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects for the PPI.

    Implications: The findings suggest that environmental interventions can be effective in controlling the immature stages of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence.

    Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that environmental methods for dengue vector control can be effective in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, the quality of the existing studies is a major limitation, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and inform public health policy.

    **Title:** Elucidating Ribosome Quality Control Pathways in Response to Selective PCSK9 Translational Inhibitors

    **Research Question:** How do ribosome quality control pathways respond to selective PCSK9 translational inhibitors, such as PF-06378503 (PF8503), and what are the implications for therapeutic development?

    **Methods:** We employed a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF8503, a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor. We used ribosome profiling to compare the translation inhibition profiles of PF8503 and a previously described compound, PF-06446846 (PF846).

    **Main Findings:** Our CRISPRi screen identified two potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503: the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and the helicase ASCC3. These proteins bind to the ribosome and protect cells from the toxic effects of high concentrations of PF8503. In contrast, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Genetic interaction experiments revealed that ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2 and functions downstream of HBS1L.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation and highlight the importance of ribosome quality control pathways in response to selective PCSK9 translational inhibitors. The identification of ASCC2 and ASCC3 as genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503 suggests that these proteins play a crucial role in protecting cells from the toxic effects of ribosome stalling.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals new connections between ribosome quality control pathways and provides a framework for understanding the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation. These findings have implications for the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia, and highlight the importance of ribosome quality control pathways in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
Title: Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) SOX Protein Induces mRNA Turnover via Aberrant Polyadenylation

    Abstract:
    The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability plays a crucial role in controlling gene expression, ensuring transcript fidelity, and allowing cells to respond to environmental cues. However, unregulated enhancement of mRNA turnover can dampen cellular responses to such signals. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes widespread destruction of cellular mRNAs to block host gene expression and evade immune detection via its viral SOX protein. Here, we report that KSHV SOX stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover via a unique mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. Transcripts in SOX-expressing cells exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase II-generated poly(A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function, and inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, the latter of which undergoes striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of host shutoff and provide a new model system to probe the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.

    Research Question:
    What is the mechanism by which KSHV SOX protein induces mRNA turnover in host cells?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of molecular biology and biochemical techniques to investigate the mechanism of KSHV SOX-induced mRNA turnover. We expressed SOX in mammalian cells and analyzed the effects on mRNA stability and polyadenylation. We also used inhibitors of poly(A) tail formation to block SOX activity and investigated the role of poly(A) binding proteins in SOX function.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that KSHV SOX induces mRNA turnover via aberrant polyadenylation. Transcripts in SOX-expressing cells exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase II-generated poly(A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function, and inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, the latter of which undergoes striking nuclear relocalization by SOX.

    Implications:
    Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of host shutoff by KSHV SOX and provide a new model system to probe the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. This study highlights the importance of polyadenylation in mRNA turnover and suggests that aberrant polyadenylation may be a common mechanism of host shutoff by viruses.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that KSHV SOX induces mRNA turnover via aberrant polyadenylation, a novel mechanism of host shutoff. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells and highlight the importance of polyadenylation in controlling mRNA stability.

    **Title:** Type III Interferon (IFNλ) Promotes Inflammation in Response to Bacterial Pathogens by Inhibiting miR-21 Regulation of PDCD4

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the type III interferon (IFNλ) receptor IL-28R in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the respiratory tract?

    **Methods:** We investigated the expression of IFNλ and its receptor IL-28R in the lung tissue of mice infected with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. We also examined the effects of IFNλ signaling on the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and the protein PDCD4 in human epithelial cells and mouse lung tissue.

    **Main Findings:** We found that S. aureus and P. aeruginosa induced significant production of IFNλ in the lung, and clearance of these bacteria from the lung was significantly increased in IL-28R null mice compared to controls. Improved bacterial clearance correlated with reduced lung pathology and a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFNλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT3, resulting in upregulation of PDCD4, a protein known to promote inflammatory signaling. In vivo, 18 hours following infection with either pathogen, miR-21 was significantly reduced and PDCD4 increased in the lungs of wild-type mice compared to IL-28R null mice.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that IFNλ promotes inflammation in response to bacterial pathogens by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the role of type III interferons in the innate immune response to bacterial infections.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that IFNλ and PDCD4 are conserved elements in the response to airway pathogens, and that the selective expression of IL-28R on epithelial cells may be important in the specific cytokine responses evoked by different pathogens. Our findings suggest that inhibiting IL-28R-dependent signaling may reduce lung inflammation and improve bacterial clearance in the context of bacterial pneumonia.
Title: Retrospective Analysis of Mortality Trends and Risk Factors in Advanced Stage-2 Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) Patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo

    Abstract:

    Background: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a life-threatening disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate mortality trends and risk factors in 781 naïve cases of advanced stage-2 HAT patients admitted between 1989 and 2012 at the National Reference Center for Human African Trypanosomiasis (CNRTHA) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.

    Research Question: What are the mortality trends and risk factors associated with advanced stage-2 HAT in patients treated with different regimens at the CNRTHA?

    Methods: We analyzed data from 781 patients with confirmed parasitological diagnosis of HAT, stage-2 disease, and complete medical records. We used logistic regression models to identify predictors of death, including age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cytorachy, protidorachy, clinical status on admission, and treatment regimen.

    Main Findings: Death proportions were 17.2% in the standard melarsoprol schedule, 12.1% in the short schedule melarsoprol, 5.4% in the first-line eflornithine regimen, 9.1% in the NECT treatment regimen, and 36% in the group with select severely affected patients given eflornithine due to their clinical status on admission. After adjusting for treatment, death odds ratios were significantly associated with clinical dysfunction on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the CSF, and high cytorachy.

    Implications: Our findings highlight the importance of clinical manifestations in assessing disease severity and the need for an objective test to evaluate HAT clinical severity. The algorithm for initial clinical status assessment used in this study may serve as a basis for further development of standardized assessment tools relevant to the clinical management of HAT and information exchange in epidemiological reports.

    Conclusions: Advanced stage-2 HAT patients with clinical dysfunction on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the CSF, and high cytorachy are at increased risk of death. Our study emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and treatment of HAT, as well as the development of standardized assessment tools to improve clinical management and patient outcomes.

    **Title:** Investigating the Impact of Isolation on Social Behavior and Gene Expression in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** How does isolation affect social behavior and gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel imaging arena and improved tracking algorithm to monitor the behavior of large groups of Drosophila melanogaster. We used automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis to quantify changes in social network dynamics in response to prior social isolation. Additionally, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis to correlate transcriptomic and behavioral changes upon social isolation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that isolation significantly and swiftly enhances individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that behavioral changes occurred throughout the six days of isolation, while gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes were mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that isolation has a profound impact on social behavior and gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. The swift and significant changes in social network dynamics and metabolic gene expression indicate that isolation triggers a rapid physiological response to promote social interactions with neighboring flies. Our results also highlight the importance of considering both behavioral and molecular changes when studying the effects of isolation on social behavior.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies, which we used to unravel the behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster. Our findings have important implications for understanding the effects of isolation on social behavior and gene expression, and highlight the potential of Drosophila melanogaster as a powerful model organism for studying social behavior and its underlying mechanisms.

    **Title:** Improving Clinical Guideline Adherence in Resource-Limited Settings: A Smartphone-Based Tool for Diarrheal Disease Management

    **Research Question:** Can a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation, improve clinical guideline adherence in resource-limited settings?

    **Methods:** A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the WHO diarrheal disease management guidelines. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period, with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. A total of 841 patients were enrolled, with 325 in the pre-intervention group and 516 in the intervention group. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc.

    **Main Findings:** During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both district and sub-district hospitals (p < 0.001), with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume better adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased (p < 0.001 district; p = 0.035 sub-district) with RRs of 6.9 (district) and 1.6 (sub-district), while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased. Zinc adherence also increased.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study demonstrate that a smartphone-based tool can improve clinical guideline adherence, particularly in resource-limited settings. The study highlights the potential of technology-enabled decision-support tools to promote evidence-based practice and improve patient outcomes.

    **Conclusions:** Despite limitations, including the absence of a concurrent control group and no independent dehydration assessment during the pre-intervention, this study provides evidence that a smartphone-based tool can improve clinical care, including better assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection. These findings support the hypothesis that technology-enabled decision-support tools can promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings. This study should serve as a catalyst for a randomized controlled trial to expand on the findings and address limitations.

    **Title:** Predicting Host-Parasite Dynamics under Climate Change: A Mechanistic Model of Within-Host Parasite Population Dynamics

    **Research Question:** Can a mechanistic model of within-host parasite population dynamics, informed by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), accurately predict the effects of temperature on host-parasite interactions and disease dynamics?

    **Methods:** We conducted an experimental study on Daphnia magna and its natural microsporidian parasite, Ordospora colligata, across a temperature gradient of nine temperatures spanning the thermal range of D. magna. We quantified host lifespan and parasite abundance at death, and fitted a mechanistic model of within-host parasite population dynamics to the experimental data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the MTE-based model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature, using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. The model captures the thermal dependencies of host aging and mortality, as well as parasite virulence, population growth rate, and equilibrium abundance.

    **Implications:** Accurate predictions of how climate change will alter host-parasite dynamics and disease require models that integrate distinct thermal dependencies for a range of host and parasite traits. Our study demonstrates the predictive power of linking MTE-based thermal relationships for host and parasite traits in mechanistic within-host parasite models. This framework provides a valuable approach for predicting the outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites in light of climate change.

    **Conclusions:** Our study serves as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. The simplicity and generality of this approach make it a valuable tool for understanding the impacts of climate change on host-parasite interactions and disease dynamics. By integrating MTE-based thermal relationships into classical models of host-parasite dynamics, we can estimate the net effect of temperature changes on disease prevalence and severity.

    **Research Question:** How do different types of GABAergic interneurons, specifically parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, contribute to the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in shaping neuronal information processing?

    **Methods:** We employed a computational model to investigate the functional role of a widespread network motif consisting of PV, SOM, and VIP interneurons in controlling the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP neurons enables the translation of weak inputs onto VIP interneurons into large changes in the somato-dendritic distribution of inhibition onto PCs. This amplification effect is supported by the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, where top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the SOM-VIP motif plays a crucial role in controlling the redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, thereby influencing information processing modes. This subnetwork is optimized to efficiently control the PV/SOM-mediated redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition.

    **Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into the functional roles of GABAergic interneurons in shaping neuronal information processing. The SOM-VIP motif acts as an amplifier, translating weak inputs into large changes in somato-dendritic inhibition, and enables the circuit to switch between two processing modes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how different types of GABAergic interneurons contribute to neuronal information processing and may have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Disentangling Direct and Indirect Associations between Microbiota and Host Phenotypes: A Statistical Physics Approach

    **Research Question:** Can we distinguish between direct and indirect associations between specific microbes and host phenotypes in microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS)?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel method, Direct Association Analysis (DAA), based on maximum entropy models from statistical physics to remove indirect associations between microbes and host phenotypes. We applied DAA to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising 275 cases and 189 controls.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that microbial interactions can generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight into the host phenotype. We found that traditional MWAS are prone to inflation of p-values due to indirect associations, leading to a loss of power to identify direct links between microbiota and IBD. However, our DAA method corrected this inflation and revealed a small subset of associations directly linked to IBD. These direct associations were more accurate in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of accounting for microbial interactions in MWAS to avoid spurious associations. The DAA method provides a powerful tool for distinguishing between direct and indirect associations, enabling a more accurate understanding of the complex relationships between microbiota and host phenotypes.

    **Conclusions:** Our research demonstrates that realistic microbial interactions can produce a large number of spurious associations, which can be removed using the DAA method. By applying DAA to a large IBD dataset, we identified a small subset of direct associations that provide mechanistic insight into the disease. Our findings have significant implications for the interpretation of MWAS and highlight the need for more nuanced approaches to understanding the complex relationships between microbiota and host phenotypes.

    **Title:** Investigating the Effect of Wolbachia Infection on Flavivirus Replication and Transmission in Mosquitoes: A Comparative Study of Stable and Transient Infection Models

    **Research Question:** How does Wolbachia infection affect the replication and transmission of flaviviruses, specifically DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain), in mosquitoes, and do the outcomes differ between stable and transient infection models?

    **Methods:** We compared the effects of Wolbachia infection on the replication, infection, and transmission rates of DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain) in two infection models: stable transinfected and transiently infected mosquitoes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that Wolbachia had similar blocking effects on both DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain) in both stable and transient models of infection. However, the magnitude of the blocking effect was significantly lower in mosquitoes transiently infected with Wolbachia. Notably, we found no evidence for any enhancement of either DENV or WNV (Kunjin strain) infection in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia.

    **Implications:** These findings support the use of Wolbachia as an effective and safe means for restricting the transmission of flaviviruses, such as DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain), in mosquitoes. The lower Wolbachia densities observed in transiently infected mosquitoes provide a plausible explanation for the reduced DENV blocking phenotype in this model.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the host-Wolbachia interaction and the model of infection when investigating the effects of Wolbachia on pathogen replication and transmission. The results of this study contribute to the growing body of evidence that Wolbachia can be a valuable tool for controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between Wolbachia, its host, and disease-causing pathogens, particularly in disease-transmitting mosquito species that remain recalcitrant to Wolbachia transinfection.

    **Title:** Conservation and Distinction of the Inversin Compartment in Caenorhabditis elegans Cilia

    **Research Question:** What are the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the Inversin compartment (InvC) in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) cilia, and how does it interact with the ciliary doublet region?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the InvC in C. elegans amphid channel and phasmid sensory cilia.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the ciliary doublet region in C. elegans. We identified a network of genes, including nphp-2 (the C. elegans Inversin homolog), arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119, that are redundantly required for ciliogenesis and modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region. We also found that glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components, but is modulated by nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119. Furthermore, we discovered that NPHP-2 requires its calcium-binding EF hand domain for targeting to the InvC.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the ciliary doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of cilia biogenesis and function in C. elegans, and has implications for our understanding of human ciliopathies.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the C. elegans InvC is a conserved and distinct ciliary region that interacts with the ciliary doublet region to regulate ciliogenesis. We propose that the logic underlying the establishment of the NPHP-2/Inversin compartment may be similar in C. elegans and mammals, in a manner independent of microtubule ultrastructure. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of InvC biogenesis and function in C. elegans and mammals.

    **Title:** Scribble Regulates Myelination and Remyelination in the Central Nervous System

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the basal polarity complex protein Scribble in the development and regeneration of myelin by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS)?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the function of Scribble in oligodendrocyte development, myelination, and remyelination. We knocked down Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia and generated transgenic mice with conditional knockout (cKO) of Scribble in myelinating glia.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes, where it localizes to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. In vivo, conditional elimination of Scribble in myelinating glia of transgenic mice disrupts myelin initiation in the CNS, both during development and following focal demyelination. We also found that Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness and suppresses the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway. Furthermore, Scribble localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate an essential role for the evolutionarily-conserved regulators of intracellular polarity in myelination and remyelination. The results suggest that Scribble function is compartmentalized through interactions with different protein complexes at sites of radial or longitudinal growth, and that it plays a critical role in regulating cell signaling and axo-glial adhesion.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study highlights the importance of Scribble in the development and regeneration of myelin by oligodendrocytes in the CNS. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying myelination and remyelination, and may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
Title: Identification of an Extended Family of Streptolysin S-Like Modified Virulence Peptides in Gram-Positive Pathogens

    Abstract:

    Background: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor produced by Group A Streptococcus (GAS), a causative agent of various human diseases. Recent studies suggest that SLS-like peptides may be produced by other Gram-positive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium botulinum.

    Research Question: Do SLS-like modified virulence peptides (MVPs) exist in other Gram-positive pathogens, and if so, what is their role in virulence?

    Methods: In silico analysis was performed to identify gene clusters potentially encoding SLS-like factors in L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and C. botulinum. Expression of these genes was assessed in vitro, and the resulting peptides were characterized for their haemolytic and cytotoxic activities.

    Main Findings: We identified SLS-like peptides, designated Listeriolysin S (LLS), Stapholysin S (STS), and Botulysin S (BTS), in L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and C. botulinum, respectively. These peptides exhibited haemolytic and cytotoxic activities, contributing to the virulence of their respective pathogens. Notably, the LLS-associated cluster was found exclusively in lineage I strains of L. monocytogenes, which are responsible for the majority of listeriosis outbreaks.

    Implications: The discovery of SLS-like MVPs in other Gram-positive pathogens expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their virulence. This knowledge may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these virulence factors.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals an extended family of SLS-like MVPs in Gram-positive pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and C. botulinum. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of these pathogens and may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention.

    Title: Immunophenotypic Characteristics of Mycetoma Granuloma: Correlation between IL-17 and MMP-9 Expression and Disease Severity

    Background: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria, characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The immunophenotypic characteristics of the mycetoma granuloma and the processes leading to this host tissue reaction are not well understood.

    Research Question: Do the expression levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granuloma formation correlate with the severity of the disease, and is this correlation independent of the causative agent responsible for the granuloma reaction?

    Methods: This study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Sudan, where surgical biopsies from 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma were obtained. IL-17 and MMP-9 expression in the mycetoma granuloma were evaluated immunohistochemically.

    Main Findings: IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III. MMP-9 was more highly expressed in Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to the levels of IL-17 (p = 0.001). The only significant association between MMP-9 and the patients’ characteristics was the disease duration (p < 0.001).

    Implications: These findings suggest that IL-17 and MMP-9 play a role in the mycetoma granuloma formation and that their expression levels are correlated with the severity of the disease. The positive correlation between IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels indicates that IL-17 may up-regulate MMP-9 expression, contributing to tissue damage and granuloma formation.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence of IL-17 and MMP-9 expression in mycetoma granuloma and highlights the importance of these molecules in the immunopathogenesis of mycetoma. Further studies are needed to determine the roles of IL-17A and MMP-9 in granuloma formation and to provide further insights into the mycetoma immunopathogenesis.

    **Title:** Elucidating Fuzzy Interactions: Polycation-π Contacts Drive Molecular Recognition by the Ewing's Sarcoma Oncoprotein Family Activation Domain

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of molecular recognition by the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family activation domain (EAD), a polyvalent intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that exhibits features of "fuzziness"?

    **Methods:** We employed an integrated functional and computational approach to evaluate the polycation-π hypothesis, which posits that EAD-target binding involves polycation-π contacts between disordered EAD and basic residues on the target. We generated EAD variants with altered aromatic number, density, and charge, and assessed their effects on binding activity. We also developed a coarse-grained EAD chain model and an analytical model to capture the interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of a generic globular target.

    **Main Findings:** Our results support the polycation-π model, demonstrating that EAD-target binding is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. The experimental effects of EAD sequence variations are well-captured by our theoretical models, indicating that polycation-π interactions play a crucial role in EAD-target recognition.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs, which are implicated in various biological processes, including cancer. The polycation-π model offers a mechanistic explanation for the "fuzziness" observed in IDP-target complexes, where the IDP remains disordered even when bound to a globular target.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that EAD-target binding is a highly versatile mode of molecular recognition, driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. This work provides new insights into the molecular basis of IDP-target interactions and has implications for understanding the roles of IDPs in various biological processes, including cancer. The polycation-π model offers a general framework for understanding promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs, and highlights the importance of cation-π interactions in protein-protein interactions.

    **Title:** Distinct Functional Roles of ATP-Dependent Proteases Lon-1 and Lon-2 in Borrelia burgdorferi

    **Research Question:** What are the functional roles of the two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease?

    **Methods:** Phylogenetic analysis, biochemical assays, and genetic complementation studies were employed to investigate the functional roles of Lon-1 and Lon-2 in B. burgdorferi.

    **Main Findings:** Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH2-terminal substrate binding domains, suggesting distinct substrate specificities. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro but failed to complement an Escherichia coli Lon mutant. In contrast, Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes, indicating that it functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles in B. burgdorferi. Lon-1, which is upregulated in response to blood, may be important in host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host. Lon-2, on the other hand, appears to be involved in cellular homeostasis, consistent with its canonical Lon-like function.

    **Conclusions:** The presence of two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs in B. burgdorferi is a unique characteristic of the genus Borrelia. Our study demonstrates that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles, with Lon-1 potentially playing a role in host adaptation and Lon-2 functioning in cellular homeostasis. These findings provide new insights into the biology of B. burgdorferi and have implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Antibody-Dependent Phagocytosis in HIV-1 Infection

    **Research Question:** Do HIV-specific antibodies mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes through antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP)?

    **Methods:** We used a green-fluorescent protein-expressing molecular clone of HIV-1JRFL, an R5 clinical isolate, in combination with polyclonal HIVIG or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) known to capture and/or neutralize HIV-1. We employed THP-1 and U937 cells, as well as freshly isolated primary monocytes from healthy individuals, as phagocytic effector cells. Uptake of virions was measured by cytometry.

    **Main Findings:** Surprisingly, we found minimal or no ADP of virions with any of the antibodies. However, after coating virions with gp41 or gp41-derived peptides, gp41-specific mAbs efficiently mediated phagocytosis. We estimated that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed (e.g., influenza virus). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed a clear association between virus aggregation and ADP. In contrast, virion-decorated cells were targets for ADP or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that ADP of virions may not play a significant role in preventing HIV infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the consequent inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcγRs on phagocytes. However, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our results indicate that FcγR-dependent functions other than ADP of free virions may be critical for maximal prevention or control of HIV-1 infection by antibody. The paucity of envelope spikes on HIV-1 virions results in a level or orientation of bound antibody that is likely inadequate for FcγR cross-linking. In contrast, CD4 lymphocytes adsorbed with HIV-1 virions are a target for phagocytosis or trogocytosis. Further studies are needed to explore the role of other effector cells and in vivo conditions in mediating ADP or clearance of virions through ADP.

    Title: Estimating the Global Economic and Health Burden of Hookworm Infection: A Computational Simulation Model

    Research Question: What is the global economic and health burden of hookworm infection in 2016, and how does it vary by country, WHO region, and globally?

    Methods: We developed a computational simulation model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in every country, WHO region, and globally in 2016 from the societal perspective. We used two different disability weight estimates (2004 and 2010) and two productivity loss proxies (Gross National Income per capita and minimum wage) to calculate the burden.

    Main Findings: Our results show that hookworm infection resulted in a total of 2,126,280 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) using 2004 disability weight estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates (excluding cognitive impairment outcomes). The total productivity losses varied with the probability of anemia and calculation method used, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using GNI per capita as a proxy for annual wages and ranging from $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages.

    Implications: Our study highlights the significant economic and health burden of hookworm infection globally, which exceeds published estimates for several diseases that have received more attention than hookworm. Notably, certain large countries transitioning to higher income countries, such as Brazil and China, still face considerable hookworm burden. Our findings suggest that hookworm control efforts should be prioritized, particularly in these countries.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive estimate of the global economic and health burden of hookworm infection in 2016. Our results underscore the need for increased investment in hookworm control and prevention efforts, particularly in countries with significant hookworm burdens. By using a computational simulation model, we have provided a robust estimate of the burden of hookworm infection, which can inform decision-making by funders, policymakers, and disease control officials.

    **Title:** Developmental Hypoxia Disrupts Vertebrate Axon Pathfinding through Evolutionarily Conserved Genetic Pathways

    **Research Question:** Does developmental hypoxia cause axon pathfinding errors in vertebrates, and if so, what are the underlying genetic mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model to investigate the effects of developmental hypoxia on axon pathfinding in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). We used a combination of genetic and chemical modifiers to analyze the molecular response of hypoxia on pathfinding, including cloning the zebrafish hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1α) and generating a constitutively active form of it.

    **Main Findings:** We found that developmental hypoxia disrupts axon pathfinding in zebrafish, leading to errors in commissural axon crossing of the midline. The pathfinding defects result from activation of the hif1 pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of the hif1 pathway or by expression of constitutively active hif1α. We identified ephrinB2a as a target of hif1 pathway activation and showed that knockdown of ephrinB2a rescues the guidance errors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism and that magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia, and they support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium. These findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the developing human brain and for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent chronic neurodevelopmental impairments.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first evidence that developmental hypoxia causes axon pathfinding errors in vertebrates through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, involving activation of the hif1α pathway and increased expression of ephrinB2a. These findings highlight the importance of ephrinB2a in mediating the pathfinding errors and suggest that magnesium sulfate may be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing hypoxic injury to the developing brain.

    **Title:** Comparative Analysis of Pulmonary Lesions in Experimental Paracoccidioidomycosis Using High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) and Histopathology

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the patterns, topography, and intensity of lung lesions in experimentally infected Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb) mice using High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) and histopathologic parameters.

    **Methods:** Male BALB/c mice (n=50) were intranasally inoculated with 3×10^6 Pb conidia or PBS (n=50). HRCT scans were performed every four weeks to assess pulmonary lesions, quantify lung density, and reconstruct lung air structure. Lungs were also analyzed by histopathology and histomorphometry.

    **Main Findings:** Three distinct patterns of lesions were identified by HRCT and histopathology: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral. Lesions were predominantly located around the hilus and affected the left lung more frequently. At four weeks post-challenge, HRCT revealed significant peri-bronchial consolidations and increased upper lung density in Pb-infected mice compared to controls (−263±25 vs. −422±10 Hounsfield Units, p<0.001). Histopathology confirmed that consolidation was equivalent to a confluent granulomatous reaction, while nodules corresponded to individual compact granulomas. By the 16th week, confluent granulomas formed pseudo-tumoral masses that obstructed large bronchi, accompanied by discrete focal fibrosis.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates the utility of conventional HRCT as a non-invasive tool for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental mouse PCM. The experimental design reduces the need for sacrificing large numbers of animals and allows for monitoring treatment efficacy through a more rational approach to studying human lung disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first description of radiological follow-up evaluation of pulmonary lesions in an experimental model of PCM. The findings highlight the potential of HRCT as a valuable diagnostic and monitoring tool for PCM, enabling the assessment of disease progression and treatment response without the need for invasive procedures. The experimental model developed in this study can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of PCM and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
Title: Development of a Novel Interferon-Gamma Release Assay for Diagnosing Latent Leishmania donovani Infection

    Abstract:
    Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant public health concern in endemic regions, where a substantial proportion of infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers despite mounting a protective cellular immune response. This study aimed to develop a novel interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA) for detecting latent L. donovani infection. We modified a commercial QuantiFERON kit to evaluate five different Leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA), and soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA). We assessed the assay's performance on venous blood samples from active VL patients (n = 13), cured VL patients (n = 15), non-endemic healthy controls (n = 11), and healthy endemic controls (n = 19). Our results showed that the SLA-based QuantiFERON assay had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI = 54.81-92.95) and specificity of 100% (95% CI = 74.12-100). Notably, we observed a positive IFN-γ response to leishmanial antigen stimulation in active VL patients, which contradicts the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings suggest that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this unexpected finding.

    Methods:
    We modified a commercial QuantiFERON kit to evaluate five different Leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, CSA, and SLA. We assessed the assay's performance on venous blood samples from four study groups: active VL patients (n = 13), cured VL patients (n = 15), non-endemic healthy controls (n = 11), and healthy endemic controls (n = 19).

    Main Findings:
    Our results showed that the SLA-based QuantiFERON assay had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI = 54.81-92.95) and specificity of 100% (95% CI = 74.12-100). Notably, we observed a positive IFN-γ response to leishmanial antigen stimulation in active VL patients, which contradicts the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. This novel assay has the potential to improve the diagnosis and management of VL, particularly in asymptomatic carriers. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the positive IFN-γ response in active VL patients.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates the development of a novel IFN-γRA for detecting latent L. donovani infection. The SLA-based QuantiFERON assay showed promising results, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our findings also highlight the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the positive IFN-γ response in active VL patients.

    **Title:** Suppression of CNFY Toxin Facilitates Establishment of Persistent Yersinia Infections by Modulating Host Immune Responses

    **Research Question:** How do enteric yersiniae establish persistent infections in the face of host immune responses, and what role does the CNFY toxin play in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of the CNFY toxin in the pathogenesis of enteric yersiniae infections using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models. We suppressed CNFY function in Yersinia enterocolitica and examined the effects on host immune responses, bacterial colonization, and persistence.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that suppression of CNFY function leads to a shift in the balance of host immune responses from inflammation and clearance to immune suppression, promoting the establishment of asymptomatic, persistent infections. This is accompanied by a preterm reprogramming of the pathogen's transcriptional response, giving the bacteria a fitness edge against host responses and facilitating a commensal-type lifestyle. In contrast, the CNFY toxin induces inflammatory responses, resulting in extensive tissue destruction, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the CNFY toxin is a double-edged sword in the pathogenesis of enteric yersiniae infections. While it enhances translocation of antiphagocytic Yop effectors, it also induces inflammatory responses that can lead to tissue damage and bacterial clearance. Suppression of CNFY function, on the other hand, allows the bacteria to evade the host's immune defense and establish a persistent infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Yersinia persistence and highlights the importance of the CNFY toxin in modulating host immune responses. The findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat enteric yersiniae infections, which can lead to relapsing enteritis and severe autoimmune disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular players involved in this process and to explore the potential of targeting CNFY function as a therapeutic approach.
Title: Identification of a Novel Pathogenicity Gene, DES1, in Magnaporthe oryzae that Regulates Counter-Defenses against Host Basal Resistance

    Abstract:
    The ability of pathogens to colonize and reproduce in host plants depends on their capacity to overcome the innate defenses of the plant. In this study, we investigated the role of a novel pathogenicity gene, DES1, in Magnaporthe oryzae, a fungal pathogen that causes rice blast disease. Using a T-DNA insertional mutant library, we identified a pathogenicity-defective mutant, Δdes1, which lacked the DES1 gene. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES1 encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes.

    Our results showed that targeted gene deletion of DES1 had no apparent effect on developmental morphogenesis, including vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, and appressorium-mediated penetration. However, the Δdes1 mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous oxidative stress and exhibited decreased activity and transcription levels of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases. Furthermore, ferrous ion leakage was observed in the Δdes1 mutant.

    In the interaction with a susceptible rice cultivar, rice cells inoculated with the Δdes1 mutant exhibited strong defense responses, including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the generation of autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction in neighboring tissues. The Δdes1 mutant displayed a significant reduction in infectious hyphal extension, leading to a decrease in pathogenicity. Notably, the suppression of ROS generation by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, resulted in a significant reduction in defense responses in plant tissues challenged with the Δdes1 mutant. Moreover, the Δdes1 mutant recovered its normal infectious growth in DPI-treated plant tissues.

    Our findings suggest that DES1 functions as a novel pathogenicity gene that regulates the activity of fungal proteins, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense. The loss of DES1 in the fungus leads to the failure of host colonization and induces strong plant defense responses. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between M. oryzae and its host plant, and highlight the importance of DES1 as a pathogenicity factor that counters plant defenses by restraining the oxidative component of PTI.
Title: Evaluating the Accuracy of Model-Based Geostatistics for Predicting Schistosomiasis Prevalence in Ghana: An Iterative Approach to Disease Control

Abstract:

Background: Schistosomiasis is a significant public health concern in Ghana, necessitating accurate mapping of its distribution to inform control programs. However, assessing infection prevalence in every potentially endemic community is impractical. Model-based geostatistics (MBG) is increasingly used to predict prevalence and guide intervention strategies. We evaluated the accuracy of MBG predictions for Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana by comparing empiric prevalence values from school surveys with values derived from a previously published MBG model.

Methods: School surveys were conducted at 79 sites to yield empiric prevalence values, which were compared with values from the 2008 MBG predictions. Schools were categorized according to WHO guidelines to determine the practical implications of any differences.

Results: Using the mean predicted values alone, 21 of the 25 empirically determined ‘high-risk’ schools requiring yearly praziquantel treatment would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. This translates to 28% of the children in the 79 schools being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in the absence of any demonstrated need.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that using the current predictive map for Ghana as a spatial decision support tool by aggregating prevalence estimates to the district level is inadequate for guiding the national program. However, assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible. We propose an iterative approach to predictive risk mapping, incorporating empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers. This approach will improve the accuracy of MBG predictions and ensure that treatment delivery decisions are informed by the most up-to-date and reliable data.

Implications: Our study highlights the importance of improving the understanding of the most appropriate way to use predictive risk maps to guide treatment delivery decisions, assessment techniques, and modelling approaches to schistosomiasis control. By adopting an iterative approach to predictive risk mapping, we can reduce the risk of undertreatment and misallocation of resources, ultimately improving the effectiveness of schistosomiasis control programs in Ghana and beyond.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of F-Series Prostaglandin Synthesis and Sperm Guidance in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** How do Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes synthesize and utilize F-series prostaglandins to guide sperm through the female reproductive tract to oocytes?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetics and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) to investigate F-series prostaglandin metabolism pathways in C. elegans. We analyzed the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes into F-series prostaglandins.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that C. elegans oocytes synthesize a heterogeneous mixture of structurally related F-series prostaglandins from omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids. These prostaglandins function collectively and largely redundantly to promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PUFA synthesis triggers compensatory up-regulation of prostaglandins derived from omega-6 PUFAs. We also identified a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme that negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings support the model that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. This cyclooxygenase-independent pathway for F-series synthesis may be conserved across species, as we observed shared features between C. elegans and mouse tissues.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of F-series prostaglandin synthesis and their role in sperm guidance in C. elegans. The identification of a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme that regulates prostaglandin synthesis highlights the importance of this pathway in reproductive biology. These findings have implications for our understanding of fertilization and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for reproductive disorders.

    **Title:** Design-Based Approach to Functional Deimmunization of Biotherapeutic Candidates: A Systematic and Rigorous Assessment of Tradeoffs between Immunogenic Potential and Molecular Function

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a design-based approach to deimmunize biotherapeutic candidates while preserving their molecular function, and what are the inherent tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and function?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function. In silico analysis of this dual objective design space revealed a spectrum of designs that exhibit tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. Eighteen Pareto optimal variants were produced and subjected to a rigorous experimental analysis of key performance parameters, including stability, activity, and immunoreactivity with human MHC II proteins.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that incremental deletion of T cell epitopes leads to a relative escalation in concomitant loss of function. The predictions underlying the design process correlated well with experimental analyses of protein function, revealing an inverse relationship between deimmunization and function. The Pareto frontier of a therapeutic enzyme has been designed, constructed, and evaluated experimentally, providing the first systematic and rigorous assessment of the functional penalty associated with pursuing progressively more deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for the development of biotherapeutic candidates. By rapidly assessing and designing for tradeoffs between protein immunogenicity and functionality, our algorithms may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of all mutations on immunogenicity and function, rather than relying on sequential application of computational tools.

    **Conclusions:** This study outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmunization of biotherapeutic candidates, providing new insights into the inherent tradeoffs linking the target enzyme's sequence, function, and immunogenic potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrating immunoinformatic epitope prediction with in silico analysis of functional consequences, enabling global protein design and deimmunization on a highly compressed time scale.

    **Title:** Temperature-Induced Hyper-Recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana: Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Environmental Modulation of Meiotic Recombination

    **Research Question:** How do environmental cues, specifically elevated temperature, influence meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed a pollen-based visual assay for recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the effects of temperature on meiotic recombination. We used genetic analysis with mutants in different recombination pathways to dissect the molecular mechanisms governing temperature-induced hyper-recombination.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana, characterized by an increase in the frequency and distribution of crossovers (COs). We demonstrate that the extra COs are derived from the major Type I interference-sensitive pathway, rather than the interference-insensitive Type II pathway. Furthermore, we show that heat-induced COs are not the result of an increase in DNA double-strand breaks, and that the hyper-recombinant phenotype is specific to thermal stress rather than a more generalized stress response.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination, and may have practical applications in plant breeding. Temperature-dependent modulation of meiotic CO frequency offers a means of aiding plant breeding without editing the genome or the necessity of working in mutant backgrounds.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that temperature-induced hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana is a specific response to thermal stress, rather than a universal response to stress. The molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon involve the Type I interference-sensitive pathway, which is distinct from the Type II pathway. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between environmental cues and meiotic recombination, and may have implications for the development of novel breeding strategies in plants.

**Title:** A Novel Computational Approach for Integrating Knowledge and Experimental Data in Biomedicine

**Research Question:** How can a knowledge-based system be developed to facilitate the analysis of high-throughput experimental data in molecular biomedicine?

**Methods:** We present a novel computational approach that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to integrate knowledge from external resources with experimental data. Our system, called the Hanalyzer, extracts information from structured and unstructured data, tracks knowledge provenance, and constructs a knowledge network that represents relationships between genes. The system also combines the knowledge network with a data network constructed from experimental data and calculates a combined reliability score.

**Main Findings:** We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Hanalyzer on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development. The use of the tool was critical in generating hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development. Each of these hypotheses was validated by further experimental work.

**Implications:** Our approach has significant implications for the analysis of high-throughput experimental data in molecular biomedicine. By integrating knowledge from external resources with experimental data, our system can facilitate the generation of novel hypotheses and highlight linkages in the data that are well supported by existing knowledge. This can lead to a better understanding of complex biological processes and the identification of new therapeutic targets.

**Conclusions:** The Hanalyzer provides a powerful tool for bench researchers to navigate the vast and rapidly evolving terrain of molecular biomedicine. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of high-throughput experimental data, including gene expression arrays, proteomics, and metabolomics. By integrating knowledge and experimental data, we can accelerate the discovery of new biological insights and improve our understanding of complex biological processes.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Surface Molecules of F. hepatica Extracellular Vesicles: Implications for Host-Parasite Interaction

    **Research Question:** What are the surface-exposed molecules of F. hepatica extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with host immune cells, and how do these molecules contribute to the modulation of host immunity?

    **Methods:** We employed a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins displayed on the outer membrane surface of two EV sub-populations (15k and 120k EVs) released by adult F. hepatica. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis were used to characterize the surface proteins and topology of major surface oligosaccharides of intact fluorogenically-labelled EVs.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 380 surface proteins, including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. The 120k EVs were found to have an endosomal origin and may be released from the parasite via the protonephridial (excretory) system, while the larger 15k EVs are released from the gastrodermal epithelial cells that line the fluke gut. The lectin profiles corresponding to glycoconjugates exposed on the surface of the 15K and 120K EV sub-populations are practically identical but distinct from those of the parasite surface tegument.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways used by F. hepatica and shed light on the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells. The glyco-amidase PNGase F drastically remodelled the surface oligosaccharides and blocked the uptake of EVs by host macrophages, while pre-treatment with antibodies obtained from infected hosts or purified antibodies raised against specific EV surface proteins significantly enhanced their cellular internalisation.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the surface molecules of F. hepatica EVs and their role in host-parasite interaction. The identification of these molecules will facilitate the design of therapeutic blocking agents to prevent parasite EV-host cell interaction, ultimately contributing to the development of novel strategies for the control of F. hepatica infections.

    **Title:** Regulation of MicroRNA Biogenesis by the Cycling DOF Transcription Factor CDF2: Implications for Plant Development

    **Research Question:** How does the cycling DOF transcription factor CDF2 regulate microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in plants, and what are the implications for plant development?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of CDF2 in miRNA biogenesis at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified CDF2 as a transcription factor that interacts with Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and regulates the accumulation of a population of miRNAs.

    **Main Findings:** CDF2 binds directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as a transcription activator or repressor, and affects DCL1-mediated processing of these primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). We found that CDF2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to maintain proper levels of their mature miRNAs. Furthermore, CDF2 works in the same pathway as miR156 or miR172 to control flowering.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that CDF2 plays a crucial role in regulating miRNA biogenesis, which is essential for plant development. The regulation of miRNA biogenesis by CDF2 may contribute to the proper development of plants through the coordination of transcription and processing of a group of pri-miRNAs. We also found that CDF2 regulates the expressions of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, which may affect miRNA biogenesis through regulating the levels of these components.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of miRNA biogenesis in plants and highlights the importance of CDF2 in controlling plant development. The identification of CDF2 as a key regulator of miRNA biogenesis opens up new avenues for understanding the complex interactions between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs in plants. Further investigation of the feedback regulatory network among components involved in miRNA biogenesis will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant development.

    Title: Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Regulates Oocyte-Granulosa Cell Communication and Primary-Secondary Follicle Transition in Folliculogenesis

    Abstract:
    Folliculogenesis, a complex and highly regulated process, relies on bidirectional communication between the oocyte and granulosa cells to provide ova for later reproductive life. However, the underlying mechanism of establishing this communication remains largely unknown. Our study reveals that oocyte geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a metabolic intermediate involved in protein geranylgeranylation, plays a crucial role in establishing oocyte-granulosa cell communication and regulating primary-secondary follicle transition. We found that GGPP and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (Ggpps) levels in oocytes increase during early follicular development. Selective depletion of GGPP in mouse oocytes impaired granulosa cell proliferation, primary-secondary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GGPP depletion inhibited Rho GTPase geranylgeranylation and its GTPase activity, leading to the accumulation of cell junction proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and failure to maintain physical connection between oocyte and granulosa cells. Additionally, GGPP depletion blocked Rab27a geranylgeranylation, which might account for the impaired secretion of oocyte materials such as Gdf9. Furthermore, GGPP administration restored the defects in oocyte-granulosa cell contact, granulosa cell proliferation, and primary-secondary follicle transition in Ggpps depletion mice.

    Our findings provide evidence that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation contributes to the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication and regulates primary-secondary follicle transition, a key phase of folliculogenesis essential for female reproductive function. This study highlights the importance of GGPP in follicular development and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte-granulosa cell communication. The results of this study have significant implications for understanding the regulation of folliculogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for female reproductive disorders.

    **Title:** Elucidating the NTP Entry Pathways in RNA Polymerase II Transcription: A Structural Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Study

    **Research Question:** What is the primary route for nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry into the active site of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during transcription?

    **Methods:** We built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble using multiple sources of existing structural data. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and structural analysis were employed to investigate NTP entry pathways.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. Although both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Furthermore, energetic studies based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels revealed that the diffusion of NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the structural basis of Pol II transcription and highlight the importance of the secondary channel as the primary route for NTP entry. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the transcription process and may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting Pol II.

    **Conclusions:** Our structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble, combined with MD simulations and structural analysis, has shed light on the NTP entry pathways in Pol II transcription. Our results demonstrate that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry, while the main channel is less favorable due to electrostatic repulsion. These findings provide a more complete understanding of the Pol II transcription process and highlight the importance of the secondary channel in facilitating NTP entry.

    **Title:** Estimating the True Burden of Dengue Disease in Thailand and Cambodia: A Prospective Cohort Study

    **Research Question:** What is the magnitude of underrecognition of dengue disease in Thailand and Cambodia, and what are the implications for public health interventions?

    **Methods:** We conducted prospective cohort studies among children aged <15 years in two provinces in Thailand and one province in Cambodia over at least 2 dengue seasons. We calculated age-group specific multiplication factors (MFs) by comparing data from cohort studies to national surveillance data in the same province and year.

    **Main Findings:** The average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed dengue was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated MFs in these provinces varied by age-group and year (range 0.4–29). Applying average age-group specific MFs to country-level reporting data indicated that in Thailand, a median 229,886 (range 210,612–331,236) dengue cases occurred annually during 2003–2007, and a median 111,178 (range 80,452–357,135) cases occurred in Cambodia in children <15 years of age. Average underrecognition of total and inpatient dengue cases was 8.7 and 2.6-fold in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4-fold in Cambodia, respectively.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that national surveillance data significantly underrecognize the true burden of dengue disease in Thailand and Cambodia. Calculating MFs by comparing prospective cohort study data to locally-reported national surveillance data is a useful approach to more accurately assess disease burden. Our estimates indicate that >95,000 children in Thailand and >58,000 children in Cambodia were estimated to be hospitalized due to dengue during the high-incidence year 2007.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the high burden of dengue disease in Southeast Asia, particularly in children <15 years of age. These findings emphasize the need for more accurate disease burden estimates to inform public health interventions and economic assessments. Country-specific multiplication factors derived from studies like ours or from capture-recapture studies can be useful for application to national reporting data to assess true disease burden.

    **Title:** Natural Killer Cells Regulate Innate and Adaptive Immunity to Promote Optimal Antiviral Responses

    **Research Question:** How do natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the orchestration of global antiviral defense against viral infections?

    **Methods:** We employed a well-defined mouse model of cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, using congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses, to examine the consequences of specific defects in NK cell function on antiviral CD8 T cell responses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against MCMV infection in vivo by limiting interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) production to non-immunosuppressive levels. This is achieved through early control of viral replication, which reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserves conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation.

    **Implications:** Our data reveal that NK cells play a critical role in regulating the intensity of innate immune responses, dampening early immunopathology, and promoting optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The ability of NK cells to respond early to viral infection benefits the host by preventing innate cytokine shock and promoting adaptive immunity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that NK cells serve not only as effector lymphocytes but also as regulators of immune system function, promoting defenses against viral infections. By controlling the functions of pDCs and modulating the cytokine milieu, NK cells accelerate the generation of effector antiviral CD8 T cells. These findings bring important advances to the understanding of NK cell contributions to immunity against infectious disease, highlighting the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune cells in promoting health over disease.

    **Title:** Nucleolin-Like Protein Regulates rRNA Gene Transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis controlling the expression of specific sets of rRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, and how does the nucleolin-like protein (AtNUC-L1) influence this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a systematic cloning and sequencing strategy to characterize 3′ETS rRNA genes and pre-rRNA transcribed sequences from wild-type (WT) and two AtNUC-L1 mutant lines of Arabidopsis thaliana.

    **Main Findings:** We identified four major rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that disruption of the AtNUC-L1 gene affects the transcription of these variants. Specifically, one variant is induced, while the others are either repressed or remain unaltered in AtNUC-L1 mutants. Notably, the most highly represented rRNA gene variant, which is inactive in WT plants, is reactivated in AtNUC-L1 mutants. We also observed that accumulated pre-rRNAs originate from RNA Pol I transcription and are processed accurately. Furthermore, disruption of the AtNUC-L1 gene induces loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigenetic marks at rRNA genes.

    **Implications:** These findings reveal a novel mechanism for rRNA gene transcriptional regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana, where the nucleolin protein plays a major role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants. Our results suggest that AtNUC-L1 binds to rRNA gene promoter sequences and directs rRNA transcription from the transcription initiation site (TIS). The loss of symmetrical DNA methylation in AtNUC-L1 mutants indicates that this protein is involved in maintaining the epigenetic regulation of rRNA genes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular basis of rRNA gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana and highlights the importance of the nucleolin-like protein in regulating rRNA gene transcription. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of rRNA gene regulation in eukaryotes and may contribute to the development of novel strategies for manipulating rRNA gene expression in plants.
Title: Identification of Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-Interacting Proteins in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Infection Reveals a Novel Role for the NuRD Complex in Viral Gene Expression

    Abstract:

    Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread pathogen that modulates the host cell environment to facilitate its replication. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) plays a crucial role in regulating HCMV gene expression by deacetylating histones and modifying chromatin structure.

    Research Question: What are the HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of HCMV infection, and how do they contribute to viral gene expression?

    Methods: We employed a rapid immunoisolation method coupled with mass spectrometry to identify HDAC1-interacting proteins in HCMV-infected cells. We also performed reciprocal immunoprecipitations to confirm the interactions between HDAC1 and putative viral proteins.

    Main Findings: We identified multiple HCMV-coded proteins, including pUL38 and pUL29/28, as HDAC1-interacting proteins. These proteins associated with the MTA2 component of the NuRD complex, a chromatin remodeling and deacetylase complex. Knockdown of RBBP4 and CHD4, constituents of the NuRD complex, inhibited HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral DNA accumulation. Furthermore, transient expression of pUL29/28 enhanced the activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay, and this effect required functional NuRD components.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the NuRD complex plays a critical role in HCMV replication, and that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs. The growth of pUL29/28- or pUL38-deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating infected cells with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, indicating a positive acting role for the NuRD elements during viral replication.

    Conclusions: We propose that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs, and that the NuRD complex is essential for efficient HCMV replication. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCMV gene expression and highlight the importance of the NuRD complex in viral replication.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Antibody Repertoire Following Primary Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection and Its Evolution Through Adolescence and Adulthood

    **Research Question:** What is the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection and how does it evolve through adolescence and adulthood?

    **Methods:** Whole genome-fragment phage display libraries (GFPDL) expressing linear and conformational epitopes in the RSV fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (G) were used for unbiased epitope profiling of infant sera prior to and following RSV infection.

    **Main Findings:** F-GFPDL analyses demonstrated modest changes in the anti-F epitope repertoires post-RSV infection, while G-GFPDL analyses revealed a 100-fold increase in the number of bound phages. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-terminus of the G ectodomain, along with increased reactivity to the central conserved domain (CCD). Panels of F and G antigenic sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from young children (<2 yr), adolescents (14–18 yr), and adults (30–45 yr) in SPR real-time kinetics assays. A steady increase in RSV-F epitope repertoires from young children to adults was observed using peptides and F proteins. Importantly, several novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. In all age groups, antibody binding to pre-fusion F was 2–3 folds higher than to post-fusion form. For RSV-G, antibody responses were high following early RSV infection in children, but declined significantly in adults, using either G proteins or peptides.

    **Implications:** This study identified unlinked evolution of anti-F and anti-G responses and supportive evidence for immune pressure-driven evolution of RSV-G. These findings could help the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides an in-depth understanding of the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. The identification of novel epitopes in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27 could facilitate the development of effective countermeasures against RSV disease.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Emodepside as a Macrofilaricide against Brugia malayi: Implications for the Treatment of Lymphatic Filariasis

Abstract:

Lymphatic filariasis, caused by Brugia malayi, is a debilitating disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Current mass drug administration (MDA) strategies using ivermectin, albendazole, and diethylcarbamazine are ineffective against adult filariae (macrofilariae), necessitating the development of effective macrofilaricides. Emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, has shown promise as a macrofilaricide, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mode of action of emodepside against adult B. malayi using a combination of whole-parasite motility measurement, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown. Our results demonstrate that emodepside potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. RNAi knockdown suggests that emodepside targets SLO-1 K channels, and heterologous expression of slo-1 isoforms in Xenopus laevis oocytes reveals that the slo-1f isoform, found in male muscles, is more sensitive to emodepside than the slo-1a isoform found in female muscles. Furthermore, selective RNAi of the slo-1a isoform in female worms increases emodepside potency. In Onchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of river blindness, we found two isoforms with homology to Bma-SLO-1A and Bma-SLO-1F at the RCK1 domain. In silico modeling identified an emodepside binding pocket in the same RCK1 region of different filarial species, affected by these splice variations. Our findings suggest that emodepside has potent macrofilaricidal effects and that alternative splicing in the RCK1 binding pocket affects potency. These results have important implications for the development of emodepside as a macrofilaricide, highlighting the need to evaluate potential sex-dependent effects of anthelmintic compounds to prevent under-dosing of one or the other gender of nematodes.

    **Title:** Identification of Loa loa Antigens Responsible for Cross-Reactivity with Lymphatic Filariasis Rapid Diagnostic Tests

    **Background:** The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where annual mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. However, Loiasis cross-reactivity with LF RDTs has hindered LF elimination efforts in loiasis-endemic areas.

    **Research Question:** What are the Loa loa antigens responsible for cross-reactivity with Wuchereria bancrofti RDTs, and how can they be differentiated from W. bancrofti antigens?

    **Methods:** We used the DH6.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa loa antigens from the sera of individuals with a positive RDT due to loiasis. Immunoblot analysis and proteomic analysis identified multiple L. loa proteins, including secreted and somatic proteins, which may be released by dying L. loa adult worms and/or microfilariae.

    **Main Findings:** Unlike the single high molecular weight W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen, reactive L. loa antigens appeared to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with loiasis. Our results suggest that the most likely mechanism for loiasis cross-reactivity with W. bancrofti RDTs is the death of L. loa Mf and/or adult worms associated with the release of multiple AD12 glycoproteins into circulation.

    **Implications:** These key differences between the circulating antigens of W. bancrofti and L. loa can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis. Prospective studies examining the duration of RDT cross-reactivity in persons with loiasis and the factors associated with its development and resolution may help to clear up unresolved issues.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a method for distinguishing between lymphatic filariasis and loiasis based on patterns of AD12-reactive antigens in human sera revealed by western blot. The identification of L. loa antigens responsible for cross-reactivity with W. bancrofti RDTs has significant implications for the development of improved diagnostic tests and the successful elimination of LF in loiasis-endemic areas.

    **Title:** Identification of Novel Ciliary Genes and Characterization of RAB-28 as an IFT-Associated Cargo in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What novel ciliary genes are involved in cilium formation, maintenance, and function in Caenorhabditis elegans, and what is the role of RAB-28 in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries to identify a unique expression profile for ciliary genes in C. elegans. We confirmed the expression of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161, CCDC-104, and RPI-1, and identified 185 candidate ciliary genes, including orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28.

    **Main Findings:** We found that RAB-28, a small GTPase, is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons and dynamically associates with IFT trains. Inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localization, whereas GTP-bound RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses revealed that overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveil RAB28 as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base. This study highlights the importance of RAB28 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cilia and sensory neuron-supporting cells.

    **Conclusions:** This study contributes to our understanding of cilia biology and identifies novel ciliary genes, including RAB-28, which plays a crucial role in IFT and BBSome-dependent mechanisms. Our findings have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliopathies, such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and highlight the potential of C. elegans as a powerful genetic model for investigating cilium formation and function.

    **Title:** Decoding Environmental Structure from Hippocampal Place Cell Activity without Prior Knowledge of Place Fields

    **Research Question:** Can the brain construct an accurate representation of space using only the action potentials (spikes) of cells with stereotyped—but unknown—receptive fields, without relying on prior knowledge of place fields or other functions relating neural responses to position?

    **Methods:** We investigated this question using hippocampal place cells as a model system. We analyzed the spiking activity of these cells in a two-dimensional environment and developed a novel approach to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that simply knowing which groups of hippocampal place cells fire together is sufficient to extract global topological features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space, including the animal's position within it. This can be achieved without prior knowledge of place fields or any other independent measurements of position.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of how the brain represents the outside world. They suggest that the brain may be able to construct its own internal representations of space using only coarse features of population spiking activity, without relying on prior knowledge of place fields or other functions relating neural responses to position. This challenges previous approaches to reconstructing position from place cell activity, which have all required knowing the corresponding place fields.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the brain can extract a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space using only the spiking activity of place cells. This may enable the brain to construct its own internal representations of space, even in the absence of prior knowledge of place fields or other functions relating neural responses to position. Our results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying spatial representation and have important implications for our understanding of how the brain represents the outside world.
Title: Activation of the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β Axis Contributes to the Pathogenesis of Viral Fulminant Hepatitis

    Abstract:
    Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe and life-threatening disease characterized by excessive inflammation in the liver, resulting in high mortality rates. Despite clinical interventions, the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory pathogenesis in virus-infected livers remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis in the pathogenesis of viral FH using a murine model of murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection. Our results show that wild-type mice infected with MHV-3 exhibit severe disease and high mortality, accompanied by significant elevation of IL-1β expression in the serum and liver. In contrast, mice deficient in IL-1R1 or treated with IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) display reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-1R1 deficiency impairs virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) production in macrophages and CD45+Gr-1high neutrophil infiltration in the liver. We also show that the quick release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by infected macrophages activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1β secretion. Mice deficient in p47phox, a NADPH oxidase subunit controlling acute ROS production, exhibit reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion, resulting in acquired resilience to viral FH. Moreover, mice deficient in NLRP3 and Caspase-1, essential components of the inflammasome complex, also display reduced IL-1β induction and ameliorated hepatitis. Our findings indicate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral FH, shedding light on the development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.

    Research Question: What is the role of the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis in the pathogenesis of viral fulminant hepatitis?

    Methods: We used a murine model of MHV-3 infection to investigate the role of the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis in the pathogenesis of viral FH.

    Main Findings: Our results show that wild-type mice infected with MHV-3 exhibit severe disease and high mortality, accompanied by significant elevation of IL-1β expression in the serum and liver. In contrast, mice deficient in IL-1R1 or treated with IL-1Ra display reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. We also demonstrate that IL-1R1 deficiency impairs virus-induced FGL2 production in macrophages and CD45+Gr-1high neutrophil infiltration in the liver.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral FH, and that targeting this axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.

    Conclusions: Our study elucidates the role of the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis in the pathogenesis of viral FH, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory pathogenesis in virus-infected livers. These findings have significant implications for the development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.

    **Title:** Species-Specific Hookworm Infections and Their Association with Severe Anemia and Iron Deficiency in Pre-School Children in Malawi

    **Background:** Hookworm infections are a significant cause of severe anemia and iron deficiency in children in tropical regions. However, the type of hookworm species (Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus) and infection load are rarely assessed due to limitations of current diagnostic methods.

    **Research Question:** What is the prevalence of hookworm species-specific infections and their association with severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi?

    **Methods:** We conducted a case-control study involving 830 fecal samples from pre-school children in Malawi. Multiplex real-time PCR was used to determine hookworm species-specific prevalence, infection load, and their association with severe anemia and bone marrow iron deficiency.

    **Main Findings:** Hookworm infections were detected in 34.1% of severely anemic cases and 27.0% of non-severely anemic controls (p < 0.05). The prevalence of Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus was 26.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Moderate and high-load Ancylostoma duodenale infections were positively associated with severe anemia (adjusted odds ratio: 2.49, 95% CI 1.16-5.33 and 9.04, 95% CI 2.52-32.47, respectively). Iron deficiency was positively associated with intensity of Ancylostoma duodenale infection (adjusted odds ratio: 3.63, 95% CI 1.18-11.20, 16.98, 95% CI 3.88-74.35, and 44.91, 95% CI 5.23-385.77 for low, moderate, and high load, respectively).

    **Implications:** This study highlights the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings. Multiplex real-time PCR is a powerful diagnostic tool for public health research.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrated a much higher than expected prevalence of Ancylostoma duodenale and its significant and load-dependent association with severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi. Our findings emphasize the importance of species-specific screening and highlight the potential of multiplex real-time PCR as a diagnostic tool for public health research.

    **Title:** COM-1 Regulates Meiotic DNA Double-Strand Break Repair Pathway Choice in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What is the role of COM-1 in regulating the choice between homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) during meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of COM-1, the homolog of CtIP/Sae2/Ctp1, in regulating meiotic DSB repair in C. elegans using genetic dissection and diakinesis studies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that COM-1 is not required for the initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but is crucial for promoting meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku. COM-1-deficient germ cells repair meiotic DSBs via the error-prone pathway NHEJ, resulting in a lack of interhomolog crossovers (COs), extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. In contrast, animals defective for both COM-1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation.

    **Implications:** Our findings uncover the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identify a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells. We also reveal that COM-1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of COM-1 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ during meiotic DSB repair in C. elegans. We propose that COM-1 safeguards timely CO formation by counteracting Ku activity and promoting EXO-1-mediated resection. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of meiotic recombination and the role of COM-1 in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during gametogenesis.
Title: Characterization of the Humoral Immune Response to Burkholderia pseudomallei Infection in a Caprine Model of Melioidosis

    Abstract:
    Melioidosis, caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a significant public health concern in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, resulting in high mortality rates due to pneumonia and sepsis. To better understand the humoral immune response to B. pseudomallei infection, we developed a caprine (goat) model of aerosol infection, which more accurately mimics human infection compared to traditional inbred mouse models. Our study aimed to characterize the humoral immune response to B. pseudomallei in goats and identify immunogenic proteins for new diagnostics and vaccine candidates.

    Methods:
    Eight outbred goats were infected with B. pseudomallei via intratracheal aerosol, and antigenic protein profiling was generated from the infecting strain MSHR511. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry.

    Main Findings:
    Our results demonstrated a significant humoral response with IgG antibodies, both in breadth and quantity, compared to IgM antibodies throughout the course of infection. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins reactive for IgG (7-20) and IgM (0-12) in most goats, despite no previous exposure to B. pseudomallei. After infection, the number of IgG reactive proteins increased as the disease progressed. Early-stage infection (day 7) showed immune reaction to chaperone proteins (GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK), which were detected in all serum samples after infection, with GroEL being immunogenically dominant. Seven common reactive antigens were selected for further analysis using ELISA, and the heat shock protein GroEL1 elicited the strongest goat antibody immune response compared to the other six antigens.

    Implications:
    Our study provides new insights into the humoral immune response to B. pseudomallei infection in a caprine model, which closely mimics human melioidosis. The identification of immunogenic proteins, such as GroEL1, GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK, has significant implications for the development of new diagnostics and vaccine candidates for melioidosis. Furthermore, the comparison of the goat immune response with human sera showed that many immune-reactive proteins are common between humans and goats with melioidosis.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates that the caprine model of B. pseudomallei infection is a valuable tool for characterizing the humoral immune response to melioidosis. The identification of immunogenic proteins and the comparison of the goat immune response with human sera provide new avenues for the development of effective diagnostics and vaccines against melioidosis.

    **Title:** Temporal Development of Cyclin B1–Cdk1 Activity in Single Human Cells Reveals a Bistable Circuit Controlling Mitotic Progression

    **Research Question:** How does cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity develop in single human cells during mitosis, and what are the implications for mitotic progression?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel approach to quantify the temporal development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in single human cells using dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and phosphorylation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome 3 (APC/C) as readouts.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity continues to increase after centrosome separation, and that cytoplasmic cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. We also found that the levels of cyclin B1–Cdk1 required to enter mitosis are lower than those needed for mitotic progression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that gradually increasing cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression. We propose that distinct thresholds for cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity exist that control successive mitotic events.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the temporal development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in single human cells, revealing a bistable circuit that controls mitotic progression. Our results indicate that cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity needs to further increase after mitotic entry and pass a threshold before metaphase to allow activation of the machinery required for efficient mitotic progression and initiation of mitotic exit. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms controlling mitotic progression and the regulation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in human cells.

    **Title:** HIV-1 Superinfection Promotes Broad and Polyclonal Neutralizing Antibody Responses

    **Research Question:** Does HIV-1 superinfection (SI) induce a dominant neutralizing antibody (Nab) response to specific epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, and if so, do these epitopes differ from those targeted after single infection?

    **Methods:** This study analyzed plasma samples from 21 Kenyan women who were superinfected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D after a median time of ~1.07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at a median time point ~2.72 years post-SI. Standard epitope mapping techniques and computational sera delineation analyses were used to examine Nab responses to 4 main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, including the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41.

    **Main Findings:** The study found that SI did not induce a dominant Nab response to any one of the 4 main epitopes in the 21 superinfected women. Computational sera delineation analyses suggested that 20 of the 21 superinfected women’s Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These data are consistent with a model in which SI with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for HIV-1 vaccine design. The results suggest that SI may drive a broad and potent Nab response that is mediated by polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple different epitopes. This supports the development of multivalent HIV immunogens that can elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.

    **Conclusions:** This study is the first to examine the Nab specificities in a cohort of superinfected individuals. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of Nab responses during HIV-1 infection and suggest that SI may be a relevant setting to study the development of a strong, cross-reactive Nab response. The findings support the development of HIV-1 vaccines that target multiple epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope to elicit a broad and potent Nab response.

    **Title:** HCMV Infection Downregulates Hes1 Protein via IE1-Mediated Ubiquitination in Human Neural Progenitor Cells

    **Background:** Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide. The mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well-defined. Notch signaling, a critical pathway in neural development, is dysregulated by HCMV infection. The transcriptional regulator Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is essential for governing neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate and fetal brain development.

    **Research Question:** How does HCMV infection regulate Hes1 protein levels in human NPCs?

    **Methods:** Human NPCs were infected with the HCMV Towne strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Protein levels of Hes1 were examined by immunoblotting (IB) from 4 hours post-infection (hpi) to 96 hpi.

    **Main Findings:** We report that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs. The HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in Hes1 degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes1 ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes1. Sp100A, an important component of PML nuclear bodies, is also identified as a target of IE1-mediated ubiquitination. A C-terminal acidic region in IE1, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE1/Hes1 physical interaction and IE1-mediated Hes1 ubiquitination, but is dispensable for IE1/Sp100A interaction and ubiquitination.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes1 protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection. This finding complements the current knowledge of herpesviruses by identifying IE1 as the first potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.

    **Conclusions:** Our results suggest that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in human NPCs through IE1-mediated ubiquitination, which may contribute to fetal brain maldevelopment caused by congenital HCMV infection. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCMV-induced neurodevelopmental disorders and highlights the potential of IE1 as a therapeutic target for preventing or treating these disorders.

    **Title:** Systematic Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding and Gene Expression in Drosophila Embryos Reveals Limited Impact of Binding Divergence on Gene Expression

    **Research Question:** How does variation in regulatory sequences drive divergence in gene expression across different species within the Drosophila genus?

    **Methods:** We conducted a systematic study of transcription factor binding and gene expression in blastoderm embryos of four Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. We used mRNA-seq to measure gene expression and ChIP-seq to determine genome-wide binding of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mRNA levels are more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression are poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding sites, suggesting that a significant portion of transcription factor binding is weakly or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that transcription factor binding has diverged considerably within the Drosophila genus, with little effect on downstream gene expression. We identified two potential genetic sources of binding divergence: alterations of BCD, HB, GT, and KR-specific motifs drive a portion of the binding divergence.

    **Conclusions:** This study addresses both the genomic causes and consequences of TF binding divergence on gene expression. Our results indicate that the genomic binding of A-P factors has changed extensively along the Drosophila tree with little effect on downstream gene expression. Overall, our study highlights the complex relationship between transcription factor binding and gene expression, and suggests that a significant portion of transcription factor binding is not subject to purifying selection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation and the conservation of gene expression across different species.

    **Title:** Evaluating the Effectiveness of Transmission Assessment Surveys in Eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis: A Large-Scale Epidemiological Study in Thanjavur District, India

    **Research Question:** Can the current guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of lymphatic filariasis elimination programs be improved by identifying and addressing transmission "hotspots" and developing evidence-based sampling strategies?

    **Methods:** We conducted a large-scale epidemiological study in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, which had undergone eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis. We screened a population of 50,363 individuals for microfilaria (Mf) and antigenaemia (Ag) and collected data on clinical manifestations of filariasis.

    **Main Findings:** Our study identified 7 "residual" hotspots with Mf-prevalence ≥1% and 17 "transmission" hotspots with at least one Ag-positive child born during the MDA period. Antigenaemic persons were clustered both at household and site levels, indicating the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting hotspots. We also identified an Ag-prevalence of ∼1% in children as a possible threshold value for stopping MDA.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the current guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of lymphatic filariasis elimination programs may miss sites with transmission potential and that the statistical assumptions for sampling and threshold levels for decision-making have not been validated. The existence of "hotspots" and spatial clustering of infections in the study area indicate the need for developing evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for transmission assessment surveys (TAS).

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of identifying and addressing transmission "hotspots" and developing good surveillance strategies for detecting them. We propose that an Ag-prevalence of ∼1% in children could be a possible threshold value for stopping MDA. Our findings have implications for the development of strategies to prevent the emergence of "hotspots" and site-specific interventions to effectively eliminate them when they persist or appear.
Title: Systematic Review of the Community-Effectiveness of Temephos in Controlling Dengue Vectors and Transmission

    Abstract:
    Background: Dengue fever is a significant public health concern worldwide, with Aedes aegypti being the primary vector. The application of temephos, an organophosphate larvicide, to water storage containers is a widely employed dengue vector control method. This systematic review aimed to assess the community-effectiveness of temephos in controlling both vectors and dengue transmission when delivered as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions.

    Methods: A comprehensive literature search of six databases (PubMed, WHOLIS, GIFT, CDSR, EMBASE, and Wiley) and grey literature was conducted. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. A total of 27 studies were included in this systematic review, comprising 11 single intervention studies and 16 combined intervention studies.

    Main Findings: The results showed that temephos, when applied as a single intervention, consistently reduced entomological indices in all 11 studies. However, when used in combination with other chemical vector control methods, temephos failed to sustainably reduce entomological indices in 11 of the 16 studies, and in five studies, it even failed to reduce the immature stages of Aedes aegypti. The community-effectiveness of temephos was found to be influenced by factors such as the quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors like organic debris, temperature, and exposure to sunlight.

    Implications: The findings suggest that temephos, when used as a single intervention, is effective in suppressing entomological indices. However, its effectiveness is compromised when used in combination with other interventions. The review highlights the need for further research to understand the impact of temephos on dengue transmission and the factors influencing its community-effectiveness.

    Conclusions: This systematic review presents more questions than answers regarding the community-effectiveness of temephos for dengue vector control. While temephos is widely used for dengue vector control, its effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the context. The lack of evidence linking reductions in entomological indices to reductions in dengue transmission remains a significant knowledge gap in the area of dengue epidemiology and vector control efficacy.

    **Title:** Distinct Mechanisms of Pericentromeric Cohesion Mediated by Ctf19 Complex and Csm3 in Budding Yeast

    **Research Question:** How do the Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor Csm3 contribute to pericentromeric cohesion in budding yeast?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the roles of Ctf19 complex and Csm3 in pericentromeric cohesion. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to analyze cohesin binding at the pericentromere, and examined the effects of mutations in Ctf19 complex and Csm3 on sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are both essential for pericentromeric cohesion, but they act through distinct mechanisms. The Ctf19 complex directs the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is crucial for ensuring the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. We found that components of the Ctf19 complex, specifically Iml3 and Chl4, are responsible for enhancing cohesin binding at the pericentromere during both mitosis and meiosis. In contrast, Csm3 is dispensable for cohesin enrichment in the pericentromere but is essential for its functionality.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of pericentromeric cohesion and chromosome segregation. We propose that the Ctf19 complex ensures additional loading of cohesin at centromeres prior to passage of the replication fork, thereby ensuring its incorporation into functional linkages through a process requiring Csm3. This dedicated pathway of cohesin loading is essential to ensure that cohesin is in place prior to passage of the replication fork early in S phase, safeguarding the fidelity of chromosome segregation.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study reveals distinct mechanisms of pericentromeric cohesion mediated by the Ctf19 complex and Csm3 in budding yeast. The Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are highly conserved, and their roles in pericentromeric cohesion may be relevant to other organisms where pericentromeric heterochromatin is known to attract cohesin. Future studies will investigate whether a similar mechanism of kinetochore-driven cohesion establishment operates in these organisms.

    **Title:** Systems-Level Characterization of Serum Metabolome and Lipidome in Dengue Virus Infection Reveals Temporally Distinct Host Responses

    **Research Question:** What are the temporal changes in serum metabolome and lipidome in adult patients with dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) at early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection?

    **Methods:** A systems-level characterization of serum metabolome and lipidome was performed using liquid chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 44 adult patients with DF/DHF at three prominent infection stages: early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent.

    **Main Findings:** Sixty differential metabolites were identified, including free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Major perturbed metabolic pathways included fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathway. Analysis of phospholipids and sphingolipids revealed association with lymphocytes and platelets numbers. These metabolites were significantly perturbed during the early stages and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers.

    **Implications:** DENV infection causes temporally distinct serum metabolome and lipidome changes, and many of the differential metabolites are involved in acute inflammatory responses. Our global analyses revealed early anti-inflammatory responses working in concert to modulate early pro-inflammatory processes, thus preventing the host from developing pathologies by excessive or prolonged inflammation.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a first detailed description of the metabolome changes in patients with acute dengue infection and offers a global molecular view that leads to the overall homeostatic physiological outcome of DF. The findings suggest that metabolites identified in this study might be used to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The study highlights the complex and dynamic host responses elicited by DENV and offers plausible physiological insights into why DF is self-limiting.

    **Title:** Mapping German Research Networks in Neglected Tropical Diseases: A Bibliometric Analysis

    **Research Question:** What are the characteristics of German research networks in Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), and how do they collaborate with international partners?

    **Methods:** A systematic search of the SCOPUS database was conducted for articles with German author affiliations published between 2002 and 2012 on 11 kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. Open-access tools were used for data cleaning, scientometrics, geocoding, and network analysis.

    **Main Findings:** From 26,833 publications worldwide, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German author affiliation, and 972 publications were processed for the five most published-about diseases. We extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners on the African continent were scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions.

    **Implications:** The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, highlighting the need to identify barriers and expand Germany's research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which were less involved in collaborations than high-income countries.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators that are used to identify opportunities for collaboration. Using free tools to analyze research processes and output can facilitate data-driven health policies. This study demonstrates the potential of social network analysis as a tool to apply to the R&D field and reveals valuable findings when used to assess German research capacities in selected NTDs.

    Title: Sustained Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Campaigns for Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) and Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH) in Haiti: A Model for Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) Control

    Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) have been targeted in Haiti since 2000 through a strong mass drug administration (MDA) program led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its international partners. By 2012, Haiti’s NTD program had reached full national scale, achieving consistently high epidemiological coverage.

    Research Question: What are the key programmatic elements that contributed to the success of Haiti’s MDA campaign for LF and STH, and how can these strategies inform future NTD control efforts?

    Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative data on treatment coverage and infection prevalence with qualitative insights from community-based research.

    Main Findings: The MDA campaign achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2012, with almost all districts exceeding the epidemiological coverage targets of 65% for LF and 75% for STH. The campaign also resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of infection, with 45 communes reaching the target threshold for stopping treatment for LF.

    Implications: The success of Haiti’s MDA campaign can be attributed to several key programmatic elements, including: (1) strong community awareness through evidence-based communication and education campaigns; (2) community trust in drug distributors; (3) directly observed treatment; (4) easy access to treatment through numerous distribution posts and a strong drug supply chain; and (5) quality data collection to inform MDA strategies.

    Conclusions: Haiti’s MDA campaign serves as a model for NTD control, demonstrating the importance of community engagement, trust, and access to treatment in achieving high treatment coverage and reducing the burden of infection. As MDA activities reach the stopping point, Haiti is poised to transition to morbidity control efforts for LF, building on existing hydrocele surgery and lymphedema patient support groups. The strategies employed in Haiti can inform future NTD control efforts, particularly in maintaining control of STH infections after the community-based LF treatment platform ceases and ensuring appropriate morbidity management for patients suffering from lymphatic filarial disease.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of CtrA in Cell Cycle Regulation and Cellular Differentiation in Sinorhizobium meliloti

    **Research Question:** How does the master regulator CtrA control cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation in the alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, particularly in the context of its symbiotic relationship with legume hosts?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis, to investigate the regulation and function of CtrA in S. meliloti. Specifically, we depleted CtrA in S. meliloti and analyzed the resulting phenotypic changes, including cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification. We also examined the proteolytic degradation of CtrA and its impact on cell cycle progression.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that CtrA depletion in S. meliloti leads to cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to that observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. We also show that the cell cycle-regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential for S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism of CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Furthermore, our ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis reveal that S. meliloti CtrA regulates distinct target genes compared to C. crescentus CtrA, including the negative regulation of the septum-inhibiting Min system.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation in S. meliloti, particularly in the context of its symbiotic relationship with legume hosts. The model of CtrA cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti developed in this work will be pivotal in the future elucidation of how the bacterial cell cycle is modulated by plant factors during the symbiosis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that CtrA plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation in S. meliloti, and that its regulatory network is distinct from that of C. crescentus. These findings highlight the evolution of highly conserved genetic networks to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria, and provide a foundation for future research on the symbiotic interactions between S. meliloti and legume hosts.
Title: Essential Role of γ-Glutamyl Transpeptidase in Francisella tularensis Intracellular Growth and Virulence

    Abstract:
    Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is a highly infectious bacterium that relies on its ability to multiply and survive within host macrophages for its virulence. We investigated the role of a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) encoded by the FTL_0766 gene in the intracellular growth and virulence of F. tularensis. By screening a HimarFT transposon mutant library of the F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS), we identified a mutant strain with impaired intracellular multiplication and attenuated virulence in mice. Our results demonstrate that the FTL_0766 gene encodes a functional GGT that enables F. tularensis to utilize glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as sources of cysteine, an essential nutrient for intracellular growth. We show that the GGT activity of F. tularensis is critical for its ability to cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond, allowing the bacterium to obtain free cysteine from its surroundings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GSH and γ-glutamyl-cysteine can functionally replace cysteine to support growth of F. tularensis in broth, and that the F. tularensis GGT can complement an E. coli GGT-deficient strain. Our findings provide the first evidence of the essential role of a nutrient acquisition system in the intracellular multiplication of F. tularensis, highlighting the bacterium's ability to adapt to the host cytosol by utilizing available GSH as a source of cysteine. These results have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of tularemia and the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this zoonotic disease.

    **Title:** Species-Specific Fusion of Parasitophorous Vacuoles in Leishmania Parasites

    **Research Question:** Do Parasitophorous Vacuoles (PVs) of Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major parasites fuse with each other, and if so, what are the implications for parasite survival, multiplication, and differentiation?

    **Methods:** Mouse macrophages in culture were infected with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastigotes and, 48 hours later, superinfected with fluorescent L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. Time-lapse image acquisition of living cells and immunolabeling of membrane proteins LAMP1 and LAMP2 were used to investigate PV fusion.

    **Main Findings:** Fusion of PVs containing L. amazonensis and L. major amastigotes was not observed. However, PVs containing L. major promastigotes did fuse with pre-established L. amazonensis PVs. In these chimeric vacuoles, L. major promastigotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, within their own, unfused PVs, L. major promastigotes differentiated into proliferating amastigotes.

    **Implications:** The results indicate that PVs, presumably customized by L. major amastigotes or promastigotes, differ in their ability to fuse with L. amazonensis PVs. Additionally, a species-specific PV was required for L. major destruction or differentiation – a requirement for which mechanisms remain unknown.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species and highlights the importance of species-specific PVs for parasite survival, multiplication, and differentiation. The observations reported in this paper should be useful in further studies of the mechanisms involved in the recognition and fusion of PVs, which may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Leishmaniasis. The findings also suggest that the isolation of amastigotes in parasite species-specific PVs could restrict genetic exchange and Leishmania speciation to mixed populations of promastigotes in insect-vectors.

    **Title:** Eliciting Broad Tier 2 Neutralizing Antibodies against HIV-1 using Native Membrane-Expressed Env Trimers

    **Research Question:** Can native, membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers elicit broad tier 2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target quaternary epitopes and exploit natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the virus?

    **Methods:** We immunized rabbits with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing native Env trimers (trimer VLP sera) or DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost (DNA trimer sera). We analyzed the sera for their ability to neutralize tier 2 HIV-1 isolates.

    **Main Findings:** Two out of eight rabbits immunized with trimer VLPs and one out of twenty rabbits immunized with DNA trimer sera developed unusually potent nAb titers that neutralized tier 2 isolates via quaternary epitopes. The trimer VLP sera took advantage of the absence of a glycan at residue 197, while the DNA trimer serum targeted the absence of a glycan at residue 230, both of which are proximal to the CD4 binding site. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that one of the trimer VLP sera shared features with monoclonal antibody PG9, consistent with its trimer-dependency.

    **Implications:** Our data show that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes. Moreover, cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan. These findings provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that native, membrane-expressed Env trimers can elicit broad tier 2 nAbs that target quaternary epitopes and exploit natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the virus. This establishes a mechanism by which autologous antibodies can potently neutralize tier 2 isolates in a vaccine setting. Our observations suggest that improving the consistency of vaccine nAb responses may be achieved by combining DNA prime-VLP boost regimens or engineering additional holes in the glycan shield to encourage nAb development.

    **Title:** Immunohistochemical Markers for Monitoring Wound Healing in Buruli Ulcer Lesions

    **Research Question:** What immunohistochemical markers can be used to monitor wound healing progression in Buruli ulcer (BU) lesions after antibiotic treatment?

    **Methods:** Tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions were collected before, during, and after chemotherapy and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of markers associated with connective tissue neo-formation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation.

    **Main Findings:** The study identified a set of markers that can be used to monitor wound healing in BU lesions, including α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) positive myofibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin, and cytokeratin 16 (CK16) expression in the epidermis. The results showed that αSMA-positive myofibroblasts emerged during the healing process and produced ECM proteins, indicating tissue remodeling and neo-formation. Additionally, the mTor pathway was found to be activated in myofibroblasts, suggesting its potential role in wound healing.

    **Implications:** The identification of these markers provides a valuable tool for monitoring wound healing in BU lesions, which can help to better understand the disturbances responsible for delayed wound healing in some patients. The study's findings also suggest that the mTor pathway may play an important role in wound healing in BU.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of immunohistochemical markers to monitor wound healing in BU lesions. The identified markers, including αSMA, fibronectin, pro-collagen 1, tenascin-C, and CK16, can be used to assess the progression of wound healing in BU patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of the mTor pathway in wound healing and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target for improving wound healing outcomes in BU patients.

    **Title:** Mitochondrial Trafficking in Response to Impulse Activity in Adult Mammalian Axons in Vivo

    **Research Question:** How does impulse activity influence mitochondrial trafficking in adult mammalian axons in vivo?

    **Methods:** Confocal imaging of saphenous nerves in anaesthetized mice was combined with electrical and pharmacological stimulation of myelinated and unmyelinated axons to study mitochondrial trafficking along resting and electrically active adult axons in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Low-frequency electrical stimulation significantly increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in comparison to silent axons. Higher frequency conduction (50 Hz) dramatically increased anterograde, but not retrograde, mitochondrial traffic by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and gradually increasing their velocity. Topical application of capsaicin to skin innervated by the saphenous nerve increased mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Stationary mitochondria in axons conducting at higher frequency became shorter, suggesting enhanced fission. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population did not accumulate near Nodes of Ranvier, but continued to travel anterogradely.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons represent sites of particularly high metabolic demand during physiological high-frequency conduction. Increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic may represent a mechanism that ensures a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of axons during high impulse load, supporting the increased metabolic demand imposed by sustained conduction.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates a physiological relationship between impulse activity and mitochondrial trafficking along normal, adult, myelinated, and unmyelinated mammalian peripheral axons in vivo. The results provide new insights into the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial distribution in response to impulse activity, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial trafficking in maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis in neurons. These findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal function and dysfunction in various neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Loss of Filamin B (FLNB) Disrupts Intervertebral Disc Homeostasis and Triggers Degenerative Changes in Spondylocarpotarsal Synostosis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Filamin B (FLNB) in maintaining intervertebral disc (IVD) homeostasis and preventing degenerative changes in Spondylocarpotarsal Synostosis (SCT), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions?

    **Methods:** We employed a Flnb knockout mouse model to investigate the effects of FLNB loss on IVD development and degeneration. We analyzed morphologic and molecular changes in the IVDs of Flnb–/–mice, focusing on the annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Flnb–/–mice exhibit rapid and progressive degeneration of the IVDs, characterized by abnormal cell fate changes in the AF. Specifically, AF cells lose their fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes, leading to endochondral-like ossification. This process is accompanied by increased TGFβ and BMP signaling, as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical target genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that FLNB plays a crucial role in attenuating TGFβ/BMP signaling and influencing AF cell fate. The IVD disruptions in Flnb–/–mice resemble aging degenerative discs, providing new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that loss of FLNB in a mouse model produces an alteration in AF cells from a fibrous to a cartilaginous fate and disruption of the nucleus pulposus, leading to degeneration, subsequent collapse of the disc, and fusion of the flanking vertebral bodies. These findings suggest that FLNB is essential for maintaining IVD homeostasis and preventing degenerative changes in SCT. Our study provides a developmental model for degenerative disc disease and highlights the importance of FLNB in regulating TGFβ/BMP signaling and AF cell fate.

    **Title:** Targeting the General Transcription Factor TFIIB: A Novel Mechanism of Immune Regulation by the Orthomyxovirus Thogoto Virus (THOV) ML Protein

    **Research Question:** How does the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV) ML protein regulate the host immune response by targeting the general transcription factor TFIIB?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between THOV ML protein and TFIIB, a general transcription factor essential for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoter start sites. We analyzed the effects of ML expression, delivery of an ML-derived functional domain, and experimental depletion of TFIIB on gene expression in host cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that THOV ML protein generates a TFIIB-depleted nuclear environment by re-localizing it into the cytoplasm, leading to altered expression of a limited number of genes. We found that TFIIB is crucial for the de novo recruitment of Pol II to promoter start sites, but not required for regulated gene expression from paused promoters. Notably, many immune genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules, require de novo recruitment of Pol II and are therefore dependent on TFIIB activity.

    **Implications:** Targeting TFIIB by THOV represents a novel mechanism to affect immune responses while keeping other cellular transcriptional activities intact. Interference with TFIIB activity may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized mechanism of immune regulation by the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV) ML protein through the targeting of the general transcription factor TFIIB. This mechanism allows THOV to modulate a wide variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules without affecting general gene expression. Our findings suggest that targeting TFIIB by viruses is a beneficial strategy for successful infection, as it enables the expression of negative regulators and tissue repair factors while inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between viruses and the host immune system and highlights the potential of targeting TFIIB as a therapeutic approach to control inflammation.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Human Parvovirus B19 NS1-Induced G2-Phase Arrest in Primary Human Erythroid Progenitor Cells

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying human parvovirus B19 (B19V) NS1-induced G2-phase arrest in primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs)?

**Methods:** We established two doxycycline-inducible B19V-permissive UT7/Epo-S1 cell lines that express NS1 or NS1mTAD2, and examined the function of the TAD2 domain during G2-phase arrest.

**Main Findings:** Our results confirm that the NS1 TAD2 domain plays a pivotal role in NS1-induced G2-phase arrest. Mechanistically, NS1 transactivated cellular gene expression through the TAD2 domain, which was itself responsible for ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) activation. Activated ATR phosphorylated CDC25C at serine 216, which in turn inactivated the cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting nuclear import of the complex. Importantly, we found that the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway was activated during B19V infection of EPCs, and that ATR activation played an important role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying B19V NS1-induced G2-phase arrest in EPCs. The ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection, and ATR activation plays a crucial role in G2-phase arrest. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of B19V infection and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

**Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that the NS1 TAD2 domain is essential for NS1-induced G2-phase arrest in EPCs, and that the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the biology of B19V infection and highlight the importance of ATR activation in G2-phase arrest. Further studies are needed to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway in B19V infection.

    Title: Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Induces Endothelial Cell-Intrinsic Vascular Leak Independent of Inflammatory Cytokines

    Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a spectrum of diseases ranging from uncomplicated dengue to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of DENV has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage, a hallmark of severe dengue disease.

    Research Question: What are the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways to DENV NS1-induced vascular leak?

    Methods: We used a systemic mouse model and human pulmonary endothelial cells to investigate the effects of DENV NS1 on vascular permeability. We also examined the role of inflammatory cytokines and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways in DENV NS1-induced vascular leak.

    Main Findings: Our results show that DENV NS1, but not the closely-related West Nile virus NS1, triggers localized vascular leak in the dorsal dermis of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 do not produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8), and blocking these cytokines does not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 induces vascular leak in TLR4- or TNF-α receptor-deficient mice at similar levels to wild-type animals. Finally, we blocked DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in vivo using inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption.

    Implications: Our findings indicate that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components. These results suggest potential targets for novel therapeutics that inhibit enzymes contributing to degradation of glycocalyx components for the treatment of severe dengue disease.

    Conclusions: Our study contributes to the growing body of literature demonstrating a critical role for NS1 in dengue pathogenesis, specifically in its contributions to directly pathogenic effects on the vascular endothelium. These findings highlight the importance of the endothelial glycocalyx in vascular leak and suggest targets for novel therapeutics in the treatment of DHF and DSS.

    Title: Dma1 and Dma2 Ubiquitin-Ligases Regulate Septin Dynamics and the Spindle Position Checkpoint in Budding Yeast

    Research Question: What is the role of Dma1 and Dma2 ubiquitin-ligases in regulating septin dynamics and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) in budding yeast?

    Methods: This study employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of Dma1 and Dma2 ubiquitin-ligases in septin ring assembly, spindle positioning, and SPOC signaling in budding yeast.

    Main Findings: Our results show that Dma1 and Dma2 ubiquitin-ligases control septin dynamics and SPOC function by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 kinase to the bud neck. We found that dma1 dma2 mutant cells exhibit reduced levels of Elm1 at the bud neck and impaired SPOC signaling. Artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck of dma1 dma2 cells is sufficient to re-establish a normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response.

    Implications: Our data indicate that septin dynamics and SPOC function are intimately linked, and that the integrity of the bud neck is crucial for SPOC signaling. We propose a model for SPOC signaling, where Dma1 and Dma2 regulate both septin ring dynamics and SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first mechanistic insight into the role of Dma1 and Dma2 ubiquitin-ligases in regulating septin dynamics and SPOC function in budding yeast. Our findings highlight the importance of the bud neck as a platform for SPOC signaling and suggest that Dma1 and Dma2 play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the septin ring and ensuring proper spindle positioning. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the SPOC and the regulation of cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Scan Reveals Climate-Driven Adaptations in Human Populations

    **Research Question:** What is the extent to which natural selection has shaped the human genome in response to climatic variation across worldwide populations?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide scan of 61 worldwide populations to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate variables. We used a comprehensive dataset of climate variables, including temperature, precipitation, and UV radiation, to test for evidence of positive selection.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a striking enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those strongly correlated with climate variables. Notably, several of these signals overlap with those from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. We also found an enrichment of strong signals in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that adaptations to climate have played a significant role in shaping the spatial distribution of variation in humans. The enrichment of signals in gene sets related to immune response, autoimmune disease, and cancer implies that climate has exerted selective pressure on these traits. Furthermore, the overlap with GWAS signals highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases.

    **Conclusions:** This genome-wide scan provides evidence for climate-driven adaptations in human populations, underscoring the significance of natural selection in shaping the human genome. Our findings have important implications for understanding the evolutionary history of human populations and the genetic basis of complex traits. By identifying genes and variants associated with climate adaptation, we can gain insights into the mechanisms underlying human disease susceptibility and develop new strategies for disease prevention and treatment.

    **Title:** Arrhythmogenic Mechanisms in Short QT Syndrome: A Simulation Study of the N588K Mutation in KCNH2-Encoded hERG

    **Background:** Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. The N588K mutation in the KCNH2-encoded hERG potassium channel is a common cause of SQTS.

    **Research Question:** What are the arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying the N588K mutation in KCNH2-encoded hERG in SQTS?

    **Methods:** We used Markov chain (MC) and Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models to simulate the effects of the N588K mutation on the rapid-delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) in human ventricular cells. We then incorporated these models into human ventricular action potential (AP) models, 1D and 2D idealized and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations, and a 3D anatomical model.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations showed that the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and decreased maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) in single cell models. However, when considering transmural heterogeneity of IKr density in the intact tissue model, the N588K mutation led to QT-shortening, increased T-wave amplitude, and augmented δV in some local regions of ventricle tissue, increasing tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to re-entrant excitation waves.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the N588K mutation in KCNH2-encoded hERG facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive explanation for the increased susceptibility to re-entry and perpetuation of re-entrant arrhythmia in SQTS patients with the N588K mutation. Our results highlight the importance of considering transmural heterogeneity of IKr density in understanding the arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying SQTS.

    **Title:** Deciphering Collective Behavior in Animal Groups: A Deep Attention Network Approach

    **Research Question:** Can a deep attention network be used to develop a predictive and insightful model of collective behavior in animal groups, while accounting for the complexity of individual interactions?

    **Methods:** We employed a deep attention network to analyze simulated and experimental trajectories of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in groups of 60-100 individuals. The network consisted of two subnetworks: pair-interaction subnetworks, which described the interaction of a focal fish with its n closest neighbors, and an aggregation subnetwork, which weighted the outputs of the pair-interaction subnetworks. We trained the network on simulated trajectories generated using well-studied behavioral rules and validated its performance on experimental data.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the deep attention network can recover the ground-truth interaction rule used to generate the simulated trajectories, as well as the number of interacting neighbors. For experimental trajectories, the model identified interactions between pairs as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions corresponded to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. The network also extracted that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbors, with weights higher for neighbors that are close, in a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that each animal in a group dynamically selects information from the collective to make decisions, and that the number of interacting individuals is dynamic and typically in the range of 8-22, with 1-10 more important ones. This approach provides new insights into the collective behavior of animal groups and highlights the importance of considering the complexity of individual interactions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a deep attention network can be used to develop a predictive and insightful model of collective behavior in animal groups, while accounting for the complexity of individual interactions. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of collective behavior in various biological and social systems, and may inform the development of more realistic models of animal behavior.

    **Title:** Quantifying the Transmission Fitness Cost of HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutations: A Phylodynamic Approach

    **Background:** The emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains poses a significant threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Approximately 10% of ART-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV-1, highlighting the need to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution.

    **Research Question:** What is the transmission fitness cost of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort?

    **Methods:** We employed a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the associated drug resistance database. Our approach is based on stochastic birth-death-sampling processes, which have been shown to be suitable for modeling epidemic processes. We considered each major resistance mutation separately, assuming a simple migration process of resistance evolution and reversion.

    **Main Findings:** Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug-sensitive strains. In contrast, the following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, and 219Q. The remaining resistance mutations did not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort.

    **Implications:** Our phylodynamic approach provides a novel method for estimating the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of HIV resistance evolution. This approach may become particularly useful in assessing the risk of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in resource-limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data are missing.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations. Our findings suggest that the 90M mutation in the protease gene has a higher fitness cost than the drug-sensitive strains, while the remaining resistance mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. This study highlights the importance of understanding the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations to inform global HIV-containment programs.

    **Title:** Elongator Complex and tRNA Modification Contribute to Oxidative Stress Survival in Fission Yeast

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the Elongator complex, including the histone acetyl transferase Sin3/Elp3, in mediating oxidative stress survival in fission yeast?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of the Elongator complex in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). We isolated and characterized the Elongator complex, including the histone acetyl transferase Sin3/Elp3, and examined its role in mediating oxidative stress survival.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that cells deficient in Elongator subunits display transcriptional defects and are sensitive to oxidative stress. We found that the stress transcriptional program, governed by the Sty1-Atf1-Pcr1 pathway, is affected in mutant cells, but not severely. However, cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 cannot modify the uridine wobble nucleoside of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA modifying activities, such as Ctu1-Ctu2, are also essential for normal tolerance to H2O2. We also found that a plasmid over-expressing the tRNALysUUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/Elp3 mutant cells.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that the lack of a functional Elongator complex results in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and subsequent translation inefficiency of certain stress-induced, highly expressed mRNAs. These results suggest that the transcriptional defects of these strain backgrounds may be a secondary consequence of the deficient expression of a transcription factor, Atf1-Pcr1, and other components of the transcriptional machinery.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the role of the Elongator complex in mediating oxidative stress survival in fission yeast. We show that the Elongator complex, including Sin3/Elp3, is essential for the modification of certain tRNAs, which is critical for the translation of stress-induced mRNAs. Our results highlight the importance of tRNA modification in mediating oxidative stress survival and suggest that the Elongator complex plays a crucial role in this process.

    **Title:** Nef-mediated Resistance to Broadly-Neutralizing Antibodies Reveals a Novel Mechanism of HIV-1 Immune Evasion

    **Research Question:** What is the functional link between Nef and Env in HIV-1, and how does Nef confer resistance to broadly-neutralizing antibodies?

    **Methods:** We investigated the relationship between Nef and Env by examining the effect of Nef on the sensitivity of HIV-1 virions to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting distinct features of Env. We used a quantitative virion immunoprecipitation assay to determine the efficiency of nAb binding to Nef-positive and Nef-defective HIV-1 virions.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Nef conferred as much as 50-fold resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, two potent nAbs targeting the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of TMgp41. In contrast, Nef had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by MPER-specific nAb Z13e1, peptide inhibitor T20, or a panel of nAbs targeting gp120. This resistance was observed with Nef from a diverse range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. Functional analysis of Nef mutants revealed that this activity requires Nef myristoylation but is genetically separable from other Nef functions.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10. This newly discovered activity for Nef has important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** We propose a model in which Nef alters MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane, rendering HIV-1 virions refractory to 2F5 and 4E10. This novel mechanism of immune evasion highlights the complex interplay between HIV-1 and the host immune system, and underscores the need for further investigation into the role of Nef in HIV-1 pathogenesis.

    Title: Elucidating the Molecular Interactions between Opisthorchis viverrini and its Snail Intermediate Host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos

    Background: Opisthorchis viverrini, a liver fluke parasite, is the leading cause of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Thailand. The snail intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, plays a crucial role in the parasite's life cycle. Despite the significant public health impact of O. viverrini-induced CCA, the molecular interactions between the parasite and its snail host remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What are the differences in gene expression profiling between uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos, and how do these differences contribute to the regulation of snail-parasite interplay?

    Methods: We employed high-throughput Illumina sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analyses to characterize the transcriptomes of uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos. Comparative analyses of gene expression profiling identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including immune defense mechanisms against parasites.

    Main Findings: Among the DEGs with immune functions, transcripts encoding distinct proteases displayed the highest down-regulation in Bithynia specimens infected by O. viverrini. Conversely, transcription of genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins was significantly up-regulated in parasite-infected snails compared to uninfected counterparts.

    Implications: The present study lays the foundation for functional studies of genes and gene products potentially involved in immune-molecular mechanisms implicated in the ability of the parasite to successfully colonize its snail intermediate host. The annotated dataset provided herein represents a ready-to-use molecular resource for the discovery of molecular pathways underlying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of B. siamensis goniomphalos to O. viverrini and for comparative analyses with pulmonate snail intermediate hosts of other platyhelminths, including schistosomes.

    Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions between O. viverrini and its snail intermediate host, B. siamensis goniomphalos. The findings have significant implications for the development of novel control strategies against O. viverrini-induced CCA and highlight the importance of further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying snail-parasite interactions.
Title: Investigating the Role of Complement Receptor 1 (CR1) Polymorphisms in Leprosy Susceptibility: A Case-Control Study

Abstract:
Leprosy, a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae, remains a significant public health concern in Brazil. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying leprosy are not fully understood, and the role of the complement system, particularly Complement Receptor 1 (CR1), in disease susceptibility is poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate the association between CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 (sCR1) levels with leprosy susceptibility in a Brazilian population. We conducted a case-control study involving 213 leprosy patients (47% multibacillary) and 297 controls. Nine CR1 polymorphisms were haplotyped using multiplex PCR-SSP, and mRNA levels were measured by qPCR, while sCR1 levels were quantified by ELISA. Our results show that individuals carrying the most common recombinant haplotype, harboring rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26, exhibited a two-fold increased susceptibility to leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017). Furthermore, paucibacillary patients with these variants presented lower sCR1 levels, which may reduce the anti-inflammatory response (p = 0.040 and p = 0.046, respectively). Notably, the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and was associated with higher gene expression, potentially enhancing parasite internalization. Additionally, we observed an inverse correlation between sCR1 levels and mannose-binding lectin (R = -0.52, p = 0.007). Our findings suggest that CR1 polymorphisms regulate mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy, likely by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation. These results provide new insights into the role of CR1 in leprosy susceptibility and highlight the importance of further investigating the complement system in the pathogenesis of this disease.

    **Title:** Sex-Specific Differences in Serum Metabolite Concentrations and Their Genetic Determination

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determination in a large population-based cohort.

    **Methods:** We analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals from the KORA F3 and F4 studies, with metabolite measurements of 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and C6-sugars. We used a linear regression approach and sex-specific genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify significant concentration differences between males and females.

    **Main Findings:** Our results revealed significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites (p-values < 3.8×10−4; Bonferroni-corrected threshold). Sex-specific GWAS showed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1) for glycine. We found that the metabolite profiles of males and females are significantly different, and specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into sex-specific differences of cell regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in study design and interpretation. The findings shed light on biochemical mechanisms that might explain observed differences in susceptibility and time course of common diseases in males and females.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the significance of sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their genetic determination. The results provide clues on biochemical mechanisms that might explain observed differences in disease susceptibility and progression between males and females. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering sex-specific effects in future studies, particularly in the context of complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders.

    **Title:** Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl): A Novel Method for Metabolic Modeling that Decouples Stoichiometry Representation from Objective Function Formulation

    **Background:** Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a comprehensive framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large, making optimization-based approaches necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function used in these optimization algorithms is directly linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model, making it a critical parameter for successful modeling.

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel method that decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions in metabolic modeling?

    **Methods:** We propose a new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl), which casts objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. This approach accounts for reaction stoichiometry in the objective function by mapping the flux space into the metabolite turnover space.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that the use of stoichiometry representation independent algorithms is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. MiMBl allowed us to expand the scope of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of several genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

    **Implications:** Our results show that the current methods lead to incoherent biological predictions when alternatively representing the reaction stoichiometry. MiMBl provides a novel solution to this problem by decoupling the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions.

    **Conclusions:** We propose MiMBl as a new method for metabolic modeling that accounts for reaction stoichiometry in the objective function by mapping the flux space into the metabolite turnover space. Our results demonstrate the importance of using stoichiometry representation independent algorithms for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. MiMBl has the potential to expand the scope of metabolic modeling and provide a more accurate understanding of the mechanistic basis of genetic interactions.

    **Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Plague Distribution and the Population Genetic Structure of the Black Rat (Rattus rattus) in Madagascar

    **Research Question:** Does the distribution of plague seroprevalence in rat populations differ between plateau and mountain areas, and is the fine-scale genetic structure of rat populations higher in mountain areas than in plateaus, suggesting an effect of landscape on rat dispersal and plague spread?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure (15 microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, each covering approximately 150-200 km2 within the Madagascan plague focus.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that rat populations displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief, as expected. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differed between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not solely related to the effective dispersal of rats. Genetic diversity estimates indicated that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir, suggesting that human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the complex relationship between plague distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat (Rattus rattus), the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. The results suggest that plague spread in rat and human populations can be partly related to the population genetic structure of the reservoir, but also to human social activities.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the ecology of plague in Madagascar, a highly virulent and re-emerging disease. Our findings suggest that the distribution of plague seroprevalence in rat populations differs between plateau and mountain areas, and that the fine-scale genetic structure of rat populations is higher in mountain areas than in plateaus. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure is complex, and human social activities may play a significant role in spreading the disease in rat and human populations. Further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of plague transmission in Madagascar.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Immunogenic Potential of Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 Family Members in Human Populations

    **Research Question:** What is the immunogenic potential of Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family members, particularly SmLy6A and SmLy6B, in human populations infected with S. mansoni?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive reanalysis of the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family (SmLy6A-K) using a PSI-BLAST-based search, identifying 11 members, including three novel proteins. We also examined IgG1, IgG4, and IgE responses against SmLy6A and SmLy6B in a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after praziquantel treatment.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that SmLy6A and SmLy6B are surface-bound proteins with canonical cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI-anchor sites. We detected IgG1, IgG4, and IgE responses against SmLy6A and SmLy6B in the study cohort, with pre-treatment IgG1 prevalence of 7.4% and 25.3%, respectively. Notably, post-treatment IgG1 levels against SmLy6A and SmLy6B significantly dropped (p = 0.020 and p < 0.001, respectively) compared to rising IgG1 levels against sub-surface SmTAL1.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that SmLy6A and SmLy6B elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities, suggesting their potential as vaccine candidates. The differential abundance of SmLy6A and SmLy6B throughout the schistosome lifecycle may influence the anti-Ly6 antibody response.

    **Conclusions:** Our study expands the number of SmLy6 proteins found in S. mansoni and provides evidence that surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B are immunogenic in human populations. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel vaccine strategies against schistosomiasis, a major public health concern in endemic regions. Further investigation into the immunogenic potential of SmLy6 family members and their role in host-parasite interactions is warranted.

    **Title:** Computational Modeling Reveals the Role of N-cadherin in Drosophila Retina Morphogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of N-cadherin in determining the morphologies of cells in the Drosophila retina during tissue morphogenesis?

    **Methods:** We developed a computer simulation of epithelial tissue, where the global interfacial energy between cells is minimized. The simulation incorporates salient features of morphogenesis, including the timing of N-cadherin expression in cells and its temporal relationship to the remodeling of cell-cell contacts.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations reproduce the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguish features of cadherin dynamics, and emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. Notably, the simulations indicate that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, thereby modulating adhesion strengths between cells.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that N-cadherin plays a crucial role in determining the morphologies of cells in the Drosophila retina, beyond its previously recognized function in cell sorting. The simulations also highlight the importance of considering the distribution and dynamic properties of cadherins in understanding how they control cell geometry.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a simple model incorporating the timing of N-cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling can explain experimental data for both normal cells and mutant cells lacking or misexpressing N-cadherin. The model's ability to reproduce the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, as well as its capacity to distinguish between different mechanisms of cadherin level control, underscores its potential as a valuable tool for understanding tissue morphogenesis. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing in modulating adhesion strengths between cells.
Title: Rapid Turnover of MT1-MMP Contributes Significantly to Extracellular Matrix Degradation at Invadopodia in Cancer Cells

    Abstract:

    Background: MT1-MMP, a potent invasion-promoting membrane protease, plays a crucial role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions involved in cancer cell invasion. However, the turnover rate of MT1-MMP and its contribution to ECM degradation at invadopodia have not been fully elucidated.

    Research Question: What is the role of MT1-MMP turnover in ECM degradation at invadopodia, and how does it contribute to cancer cell invasion?

    Methods: We employed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments with fluorescence-tagged MT1-MMP to investigate the turnover rate of MT1-MMP at invadopodia. We also constructed a computational model to simulate the FRAP experiments and ECM degradation. Additionally, we inhibited vesicle transport experimentally and in simulation to assess its impact on ECM degradation.

    Main Findings: Our FRAP experiments revealed rapid recovery of MT1-MMP at invadopodia, with time constants of 26 s and 259 s. The recovery was primarily dependent on vesicle transport, rather than lateral diffusion. Our computational model successfully reproduced the FRAP experiments and predicted a significant contribution of MT1-MMP turnover to ECM degradation. Inhibition of vesicle transport blocked ECM degradation experimentally and in simulation, and the degree of reduction in ECM degradation correlated with the degree of reduction in MT1-MMP turnover.

    Implications: Our findings establish the critical role of rapid MT1-MMP turnover in ECM degradation at invadopodia, highlighting the importance of continuous transport of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane for maintenance of invadopodia's ECM-degrading activity. Our computational model provides a valuable tool for designing and evaluating intervention strategies to inhibit cancer cell invasion.

    Conclusions: The rapid turnover of MT1-MMP at invadopodia is essential for ECM degradation and cancer cell invasion. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer cell invasion and highlights the potential of targeting MT1-MMP turnover as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit cancer progression.

    **Title:** Spatial Dynamics of Drug-Resistant HIV-1 Emergence and Spread within an Infected Individual

    **Research Question:** How does drug-resistant HIV-1 arise and spread spatially within an infected individual, and what is the impact of compartmentalization on its emergence?

    **Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study of four macaques infected with RT-SHIVmne027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and treated with RT inhibitors. We isolated viral DNA and RNA from the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at a median of four time points and characterized RT via single-genome sequencing.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal a dynamic system in which viral RNA rapidly acquires drug resistance concomitantly across compartments through multiple independent mutations. The blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized rarely, while the blood and lymph node were more frequently different from mucosal tissues. Notably, the gut exhibited faster vRNA turnover than the plasma, and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses than other sampled compartments.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that even frequently sampled blood may not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, particularly the gut, where vRNA turnover is faster. Our results may explain the varied results of previous compartmentalization studies in HIV-1.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the spatial dynamics of drug-resistant HIV-1 emergence and spread within an infected individual. Our findings highlight the importance of considering compartmentalization when sampling for HIV-1 genetic variation, particularly in the genital tract, to better reconstruct transmission chains and epidemiological tracking of transmitted drug resistance. Understanding HIV-1 genetic variation across the body may also contribute to our understanding of viral reservoirs and the potential for virus eradication. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of RT-SHIV as a model system for HIV-1 and highlights the need for further research into the spatial dynamics of HIV-1 within an infected individual.

    **Title:** Feedback Regulation of Cell Lineage Progression and Tissue Morphogenesis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** Does feedback regulation of cell lineage progression play a crucial role in tissue morphogenesis, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed mathematical modeling to investigate the effects of feedback regulation of stem and progenitor cell self-renewal on tissue growth and morphogenesis. Our models incorporated both positive and negative diffusible signals acting on stem and/or progenitor cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that feedback regulation of stem or progenitor cell self-renewal can lead to growth bistability or bimodality, characterized by ultrasensitive switching between high and low (or zero) growth states. This behavior arises from the simultaneous presence of saturable positive and negative feedback. We also demonstrate that this feedback architecture gives rise to spatially dynamic behaviors, manifesting as sharply localized differences in net growth, which can drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers – the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that feedback regulation of cell lineage progression plays a critical role in tissue morphogenesis, and that this process is not solely dependent on the regulation of cell cycle speeds. Instead, the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal is the key driver of morphogenetic behaviors. Furthermore, our results imply that final-state models may be more suitable for representing lineage dynamics during morphogenesis, even in self-renewing tissues, due to the rapid nature of tissue morphogenesis relative to cell lifespans.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our mathematical modeling approach reveals that feedback regulation of stem and progenitor cell self-renewal can lead to a range of morphogenetic behaviors, including bistability, ultrasensitivity, and spatial self-organization. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying tissue morphogenesis and highlight the importance of feedback regulation in this process.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Multiple Genetic Factors Contributing to Myopia Onset in Europeans

    **Background:** Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the most common eye disorder, primarily resulting from excess elongation of the eye. Despite its prevalence, the etiology of myopia remains poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic factors contributing to the onset of myopia in Europeans?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 45,771 participants from the 23andMe database, analyzing data on age of myopia onset. We performed a survival analysis to identify significant associations between genetic variants and myopia onset.

    **Main Findings:** Our study identified 22 genome-wide significant associations with myopia age of onset, 20 of which are novel. Ten of these novel associations replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants. These associations explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age of onset and point to multiple mechanisms underlying myopia development, including extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that multiple genetic factors contribute to the development of myopia, and that complex interactions between these factors may underlie myopia in humans. Notably, many of our associations with strong effects on age of onset have not been detected in previous refractive error GWAS, implying that some genetic factors may affect age of onset independently of eventual severity.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of myopia onset in Europeans, highlighting the importance of considering age of onset as a distinct phenotype. Our findings have implications for understanding the complex etiology of myopia and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat this common eye disorder. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional mechanisms underlying these associations and to identify additional genetic factors contributing to myopia development.

    **Title:** Investigating the Effects of Body Curvature-Based Sensory Feedback on Steady Swimming in Lampreys

    **Research Question:** How do different forms of body curvature-based sensory feedback influence steady swimming energetics and kinematics in lampreys?

    **Methods:** We developed a multiscale computational model of the lamprey closed-loop neuromechanical system, incorporating a distributed central pattern generator (CPG) circuit and two forms of feedback: directional and magnitude feedback. The CPG was modeled as chains of coupled oscillators, representing the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. The emergent curvature of the body served as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that directional feedback, which excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side depending on the sign of a chosen gain parameter, does not affect beat frequency but changes the duration of muscle activity. In contrast, magnitude feedback, which provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides, tends to increase beat frequency and reduces the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain is high and positive. Notably, both types of feedback resulted in a similar magnitude of body curvature.

    **Implications:** These findings indicate that the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback on the CPG with different functional forms can cause distinct differences in swimming performance. This suggests that the lamprey's ability to adjust its swimming pattern in response to sensory inputs from the environment is more complex than previously thought.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the role of body curvature-based sensory feedback in steady swimming in lampreys. The results highlight the importance of considering the functional form of curvature feedback in understanding the lamprey's closed-loop neuromechanical system. These findings have implications for our understanding of sensorimotor integration during locomotion and may contribute to the development of more efficient swimming patterns in artificial systems.

    **Title:** Competition Dynamics in HIV Epidemics: A Stochastic Modeling Framework Reveals a Strong First-Comer Advantage

    **Background:** The global phylogeography of HIV outside Africa is characterized by compartmentalized local epidemics dominated by a single subtype, indicating strong founder effects. We hypothesized that the competition of viral strains at the epidemic level may involve an advantage of the resident strain that was the first to colonize a population, slowing down the invasion of new strains and thus the diversification of the epidemic.

    **Methods:** We developed a stochastic modeling framework to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks. We simulated epidemics in which the second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic, assessing whether and on what time scale the second strain was able to spread in the population. Simulations were parameterized based on empirical data, testing scenarios with varying levels of overall prevalence.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that the spread of the second strain occurred on a much slower time scale compared to the initial expansion of the first strain. With strains of equal transmission efficiency, the second strain was unable to invade on a time scale relevant for the history of the HIV pandemic. To become dominant over a time scale of decades, the second strain needed a considerable (>25%) advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. The inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest a strong first-comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and influence the future evolution of the pandemic. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms of interference, such as inhibition of superinfection, depletion of highly connected hubs in the network, and one-time acute peak of infectiousness, which can contribute to the inhibition effect.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, shedding light on the processes that shape the global phylogeography of the virus. The results have important implications for understanding the evolution of the HIV pandemic and may inform strategies for controlling and preventing the spread of the virus.

    **Title:** Multiscale Organization of Muscle Cells: The Role of Extracellular Boundary Conditions in Cytoskeletal Scaffolding

    **Research Question:** How do extracellular boundary conditions influence the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for directed sarcomeregenesis in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes?

    **Methods:** We developed a quantitative model of cytoskeleton organization in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in response to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. Numerical results and in vitro assays were used to control myocyte shape and investigate the effects of extracellular boundary conditions on cytoskeletal architecture.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from two temporally-ordered organizational processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. A hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, and a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating the break in symmetry, potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions, to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that extracellular boundary conditions play a crucial role in the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for directed sarcomeregenesis. This has significant implications for understanding the development and function of striated muscle cells, where myofibrils are rearranged from an irregularly dispersed pattern into tightly organized bundles spanning the length of the cell.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational model recapitulates the elegant protein choreography of sarcomere assembly, where an ensemble of proteins assembles repetitively along the length of the actin fiber template. We propose that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, and that extracellular boundary conditions are essential for initiating the break in symmetry and polarizing the contractile cytoskeleton. These findings provide new insights into the multiscale organization of muscle cells and have important implications for understanding muscle development, function, and disease.

    Title: Evaluating the Invasive Potential of Wolbachia wMel Strain in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes in Urban Environments of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

    Background: Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium, is being trialled as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. However, the invasive potential of Wolbachia in diverse urban environments remains unclear.

    Research Question: Can the wMel strain of Wolbachia effectively invade and spread in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil?

    Methods: We conducted laboratory experiments to assess the phenotypic effects of the wMel strain on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background. We also performed mark-release-recapture experiments in two areas of Rio de Janeiro to understand the effects of urban landscapes on mosquito survival. Mathematical models were constructed using laboratory and field data to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood of Wolbachia infection frequency reaching 100% following mosquito release.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, high maternal transmission rates, and no evident detrimental effects on host fecundity or fertility. Mark-release-recapture experiments revealed differences in daily probability of survival for mosquitoes at various sites, with better-developed sites being less hospitable. Mathematical models predicted successful invasion at all five field sites, with local mosquito abundance being the most important factor influencing the spread of Wolbachia.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place. However, our results also highlight the importance of characterizing field sites prior to Wolbachia release to determine the optimal release strategy.

    Conclusions: Our study provides a useful framework for the ongoing field-releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti in Brazil and will likely hold similar utility for future releases in other heterogeneous urban landscapes. Our results emphasize the need to release Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in higher numbers at sites with larger populations of wildtype mosquitoes to ensure successful invasion.

    **Title:** Identification of JMJ703 as a Histone H3 Lysine 4 Demethylase Essential for Rice Plant Development

    **Background:** Histone lysine methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) plays a significant role in plant developmental control and stress adaptation. However, the resetting mechanism of this epigenetic modification is not fully understood.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of JMJ703, a JmjC domain-containing protein, in reversing H3K4me in rice plants?

    **Methods:** We identified JMJ703 as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of H3K4me in rice. We analyzed the developmental function, enzymatic activity, and crystal structure of JMJ703 to understand its role in plant development.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that JMJ703 is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation. We found that JMJ703 specifically demethylates mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4 in vivo and in vitro. The loss-of-function mutation of the JMJ703 gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant.

    **Implications:** Our study provides evidence that JMJ703 is a histone demethylase specifically reversing the three forms of methylated H3K4. This suggests that JMJ703 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in rice plants. The phenotype caused by T-DNA insertion and RNAi and increased expression of CKX genes suggest that JMJ703 may regulate growth hormone metabolism in rice.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, we have identified JMJ703 as an H3K4 demethylase that is essential for rice plant development. The structural features of JMJ703, including key residues that interact with cofactors and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide, are conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of H3K4me in plants and highlights the importance of JMJ703 in plant development.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanistic Basis of HIV-1 Capsid-Ligand Interactions: A Hexameric Perspective

    **Research Question:** How do multiple host cell and pharmacologic ligands interact with the HIV-1 capsid, and what is the mechanistic basis for these interactions?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of HIV-1 capsid hexamers in complex with peptides comprising the linear binding epitopes of NUP153 and CPSF6, as well as the antiviral compounds PF74 and BI-2.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that a multi-subunit interface formed exclusively within CA hexamers mediates binding to linear epitopes within cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF6, and is competed for by the antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand is anchored via a shared phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif to a pocket within the N-terminal domain of one monomer, and all but BI-2 also make essential interactions across the N-terminal domain: C-terminal domain (NTD:CTD) interface to a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into CA monomers prevents high-affinity interaction with CPSF6 and PF74, and abolishes binding to NUP153.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a molecular basis for the associations of NUP153, CPSF6, and PF74 with the HIV-1 capsid, and reveal that multiple ligands share an overlapping interface in HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly. This interface is conformationally dynamic, but binding of NUP153 or CPSF6 peptides is accommodated by only one conformation. NUP153 and CPSF6 have overlapping binding sites, but each makes unique CA interactions that, when mutated selectively, perturb cofactor dependency.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanistic basis of HIV-1 capsid-ligand interactions, and highlights the importance of considering the hexameric structure of the HIV-1 capsid in understanding these interactions. The identification of a shared interface in HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly has significant implications for the development of antiretroviral therapies and our understanding of HIV-1 infection.

Title: Improved Genome Assembly of Aedes aegypti Reveals Insights into Disease Transmission and Vector Competence

Background: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector of several human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. Despite its importance, the Aedes aegypti genome remains poorly assembled, with 4,758 scaffolds and few assigned to chromosomes. To address this, we aimed to improve the genome assembly by scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti and generating a genetic map.

Methods: We scored a large number of SNPs in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti and used these to generate a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. We corrected these errors and assigned 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately ordered the scaffolds along the chromosome.

Results: Our improved genome assembly revealed large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend to as much as 47% of the chromosome. We also mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi and generated a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait.

Implications: The improved genome assembly of Ae. aegypti will facilitate the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission and vector competence. Our results demonstrate the utility of this new genome assembly by re-mapping the genetic susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to B. malayi. This study highlights the importance of accurate genome assembly for understanding the genetic basis of disease transmission and vector competence.

Conclusions: Our improved genome assembly of Ae. aegypti provides a valuable resource for understanding the genetic basis of disease transmission and vector competence. The identification of large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres and the mapping of a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to B. malayi will facilitate the development of new strategies for controlling the spread of arboviruses.

    **Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Surveillance Tools for Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes: A Multicentric Entomological Survey

    **Background:** Aedes aegypti is a primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, necessitating effective vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional household larval surveys remain the primary surveillance method, despite the availability of new trapping devices.

    **Research Question:** This study aimed to compare the entomological indices generated by four types of traps (BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps) with larval surveys in terms of their sensitivity to detect mosquito density variation in five mid-sized cities with varying tropical climate regimens.

    **Methods:** A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five cities, with each city divided into three 1 km2 areas. Traps for adults and eggs were applied monthly, simultaneously with larval surveys. Trap positivity and density indices were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize the seasonal pattern of mosquito infestation.

    **Main Findings:** The House Index was consistently low in most cities, while traps rarely produced null indices, indicating their greater sensitivity in detecting Ae. aegypti presence. Trap positivity indices plateaued at high mosquito densities, but both indices agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature rather than precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates that all investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should consider differences in cost and ease-of-use.

    **Conclusions:** This study supports the development of trap-based surveillance programs in dengue-endemic countries. Traps are valuable tools that can be used in combination with vector control strategies to improve responses to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti. Household larval surveys and trap-based surveillance systems are not interchangeable approaches, and traps' statistical properties should be invariant and consistently behave under both low and high abundances. Future studies should assess the cost-benefit of integrated strategies combining larval surveys and trap-based surveillance.

    **Title:** RNA-dependent Oligomerization of APOBEC3G and Its Role in HIV-1 Inhibition and Virion Packaging

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the oligomerization of APOBEC3G (A3G), a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, and how does this process contribute to its antiviral function?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of structural biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology techniques, including yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, chemical crosslinking, and homology modeling, to investigate the oligomerization of A3G and its role in HIV-1 inhibition and virion packaging.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 within the enzymatically inactive N-terminal cytidine deaminase domain (CDA) of A3G mediate oligomerization of the protein, which coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. We also found that oligomerization is RNA-dependent and that specific residues within a positively charged pocket formed by a putative dimer interface are crucial for this process. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 within this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3G oligomerization, packaging into virions, and antiviral function. The specificity of A3G oligomerization for certain RNA molecules may impart selectivity for the establishment of an A3G-Gag interaction and virion packaging.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the oligomerization of A3G and its role in HIV-1 inhibition and virion packaging. Our findings have implications for understanding the structure-function organization of APOBEC proteins and for the development of therapeutic strategies to manipulate the interaction between A3G and HIV-1.

    **Title:** Dissecting the Molecular Mechanisms of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) Alleles: A Case Study of the Bric-a-Brac Locus in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** What is the fine structure of functional variation that underlies large-effect QTL alleles segregating in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster?

    **Methods:** We sequenced the 148 kb bric-a-brac (bab) genomic region from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster to identify and characterize the sequence polymorphisms that comprise major effect QTL alleles segregating at the bric-a-brac locus.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that natural bric-a-brac alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation reflect a cumulative impact of polymorphisms that affect three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression at the bric-a-brac locus confirms that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level.

    **Implications:** Our findings establish that a single QTL can act through a confluence of multiple molecular mechanisms and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. These results have important design and conceptual implications for basic and medical genomics.

    **Conclusions:** This study takes a QTL study to its logical conclusion by describing the fine structure of functional variation that underlies large-effect QTL alleles segregating in a natural population. Our results suggest that accumulation of multiple mutations at the same locus may be a relatively common mechanism of micro- and macroevolutionary change. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of considering the cumulative impact of multiple polymorphisms on gene regulation and phenotype, which has significant implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.

    **Title:** Co-stimulation of Competence and Bacteriocin Production in Streptococcus pneumoniae Enhances Genetic Exchange and Adaptation

    **Research Question:** How does the co-stimulation of competence and bacteriocin production in Streptococcus pneumoniae influence genetic exchange and adaptation in biofilm-grown organisms?

    **Methods:** We investigated the relationship between competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and bacteriocin production in Streptococcus pneumoniae using biofilm-grown organisms as a model for competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that CSP stimulates the production of a diverse array of blp bacteriocins through increased production and secretion of the bacteriocin pheromone, BlpC. This cross-stimulation requires a functional competence regulatory system and is mediated by a highly conserved motif in the promoter of the operon encoding BlpC and its transporter. The accumulation of BlpC following CSP stimulation results in augmented activation of the entire blp locus. Furthermore, we show that DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion, suggesting that co-stimulation of bacteriocins with competence provides an adaptive advantage.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the co-stimulation of competence and bacteriocin production in Streptococcus pneumoniae is a key mechanism for promoting genetic exchange and adaptation in biofilm-grown organisms. This adaptive strategy allows pneumococci to target and lyse a wide array of potential competitors while simultaneously incorporating their DNA, thereby enhancing their fitness and resilience.

    **Conclusions:** The blp and com regulatory pathways, although diverged and specialized in a remote ancestor of pneumococcus, have maintained a regulatory connection that promotes competition and adaptation. Our study highlights the complex interplay between competence and bacteriocin production in Streptococcus pneumoniae and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the remarkable adaptability of this pathogen. These findings have important implications for our understanding of pneumococcal disease and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this persistent human pathogen.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Poliovirus IRES-Mediated Translation: The Role of PCBP2 and SRp20 in Ribosome Recruitment

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the interaction between cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20 in the recruitment of ribosomes to poliovirus RNA for IRES-mediated translation initiation?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the interaction between PCBP2 and SRp20 in poliovirus-infected cells. Immunofluorescence and co-sedimentation assays were used to examine the subcellular localization and association of SRp20 and PCBP2 with 40S ribosomal subunits. A mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SRp20ΔRRM) was generated and expressed in poliovirus-infected cells to assess its effect on virus yield.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SRp20 dramatically re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected neuroblastoma cells, where it partially co-localizes with PCBP2. Co-sedimentation assays revealed that SRp20 and PCBP2 are associated with 40S ribosomal subunits in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells, suggesting their involvement in translation initiation complex formation. Expression of SRp20ΔRRM resulted in a ∼100-fold decrease in virus yield for poliovirus, indicating that SRp20 plays a critical role in poliovirus infection.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new evidence for the importance of the PCBP2-SRp20 interaction in intact cells during poliovirus infection and suggest a model by which PCBP2, bound to the viral RNA, interacts with SRp20 to recruit the translation initiation complex to the viral RNA. This study highlights the significance of non-canonical factors in bridging the translation machinery to the RNA and provides insights into potential mechanisms of ribosome recruitment for picornavirus IRES-mediated translation initiation.

    **Conclusions:** Our results support the model that SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 on poliovirus RNA, and this interaction functions either directly or indirectly to recruit the translation machinery to the viral RNA for IRES-mediated translation initiation. These findings have implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying poliovirus infection and highlight the importance of SR proteins in linking nuclear splicing and export with translation in eukaryotic cells.

    Title: Identification of Genetic Pathways Regulating Neural Crest Development through ENU-Mutagenesis Screen

    Background: The neural crest (NC) is a population of embryonic stem cells that gives rise to various cell types, including neurons, glia, and melanocytes. Mutations in genes and genetic pathways regulating NC development lead to neurocristopathies, a spectrum of human developmental disorders. To identify molecular pathways regulating NC development and understand how alterations in these processes lead to disease, we employed an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10LacZ/+.

    Methods: We conducted a whole-genome ENU mutagenesis screen to identify mutations that alter patterning of Sox10-expressing NC derivatives. We analyzed 71 G1 lines and mapped four heritable loci, called modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1-4 (msp1-4), which show altered NC patterning. Linkage analysis, sequencing, and complementation testing confirmed that msp1 is a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, Erbb3msp1, carrying a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein.

    Main Findings: In homozygous msp1 embryos, Sox10LacZ expression is absent in cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, and the sympathetic chain; however, the development of other Sox10-expressing cells appears unaffected by the mutation. Biochemical analysis of the mutant protein showed that ERBB3 is expressed on the cell surface, but its ligand-induced phosphorylation is dramatically reduced by the msp1 mutation. These findings highlight the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation.

    Implications: This study underscores the utility of using an ENU mutagenesis to identify genetic pathways regulating NC development and to dissect the roles of discrete protein domains. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of gene function in a cellular and developmental setting, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying neurocristopathies.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the power of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways regulating NC development and highlights the importance of ERBB3 receptor function in this process. The identification of msp1 as a new allele of Erbb3 provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurocristopathies, ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these disorders.
Title: Investigating Risk Factors for Schistosoma mansoni Infection in a Rural Ugandan Fishing Community: A Multidisciplinary Approach

    Abstract:
    Schistosoma mansoni infection intensity and prevalence in endemic communities are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including exposure-related variables and susceptibility factors such as immunology and genetics. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for S. mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community receiving treatment as part of a multi-disciplinary longitudinal reinfection study. We examined the influence of age, sex, and ethnic background on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment, using individual estimates of cercarial exposure and multivariable methods to control for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities. Our findings suggest that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility to infection. Notably, age-related differences in reinfection were linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1 (formerly Sm22.6), which was significantly related to resistance to reinfection. This study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings, allowing for a better understanding of the ecology of a population and more robust conclusions to be made.

    Methods:
    We used data from a multidisciplinary reinfection study based in a Ugandan fishing community highly endemic for schistosomiasis. To account for the complex, ethnically-influenced patterns of exposure observed in this community, we utilized previously derived individual-level cercarial exposure scores to adjust for variations in exposure.

    Main Findings:
    Our findings suggest that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility to infection. In contrast, age-related differences in reinfection were linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1 (formerly Sm22.6), which was significantly related to resistance to reinfection.

    Implications:
    This study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings, allowing for a better understanding of the ecology of a population and more robust conclusions to be made. Our findings suggest that cercarial exposure is a critical factor in determining susceptibility to S. mansoni infection, and that IgE and IgG4 responses to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1 may play a role in resistance to reinfection.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates the value of a multidisciplinary approach in understanding the complex factors influencing S. mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community. Our findings have important implications for the development of effective control strategies for schistosomiasis, and highlight the need for further research into the role of IgE and IgG4 responses in resistance to reinfection.

    **Title:** Correlation between Stool Examination by Eggs per Gram (EPGs) and Worm Burden in Human Clonorchiasis

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) and the actual worm burden in individuals infected with Clonorchis sinensis?

    **Methods:** A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10 egg-negative, from Sancheong-gun, Korea, participated in a worm collection trial between 2006 and 2009. Participants were diagnosed by egg positivity in feces using the Kato-Katz method. After administration of praziquantel, they were purged with cathartics on the next day, and then discharged adult worms were collected from their feces. EPGs ranged from 0 to 65,544.

    **Main Findings:** A positive correlation between EPGs and numbers of worms was demonstrated (r = 0.681, P < 0.001). Worm recovery rates were 9.7% in cases of EPGs 1-1,000 and 73.7% in those of EPGs over 1,000. No worms were detected from egg-negative subjects. The maximum egg count per worm per day was roughly estimated to be 3,770 in a subject with EPGs 2,664 and 106 collected worms.

    **Implications:** The results suggest that EPGs is a reliable method for estimating worm burden in human clonorchiasis. The estimated number of worms in a human body with EPGs around 3,000 is at least 110, and the egg productivity of a worm per day is approximately 4,000.

    **Conclusions:** This study confirms the correlation between EPGs and worm burden in human clonorchiasis, supporting the use of EPGs as a diagnostic tool for estimating worm burden. The results also provide valuable insights into the biology of Clonorchis sinensis infection in humans, including the estimated number of worms and egg productivity per worm per day. These findings have important implications for the development of effective treatment and control strategies for clonorchiasis.

    **Title:** Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets for Antifungal Drug Resistance through Unbiased Genome-Wide Screens

    **Research Question:** Can unbiased genome-wide screens reveal novel genetic components within interaction networks as potential targets in combination therapies for antifungal drug resistance?

    **Methods:** We implemented an unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function allele, which is the principal mediator of fluconazole resistance in this human fungal pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal S. cerevisiae genetic mutants were identified in cells expressing C. glabrata PDR1+.

    **Main Findings:** One mutant, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was investigated further. Deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug-mediated inactivation of Gcn5 inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments.

    **Implications:** These findings provide proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that, when therapeutically targeted, could allow effective treatment of drug-resistant infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that targeting Gcn5, a synthetically lethal interacting partner of PDR1L280F identified in S. cerevisiae, renders both this species and the orthologous C. glabrata mutant inviable, strongly supporting the proposition that targeting synthetic lethal interactions offers a new paradigm for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. The identification of synthetic lethal genetic interactions with alleles that confer antifungal drug resistance is a valuable approach to identify pathways that could be targeted to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.

    **Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Poliovirus-Induced Membranous Structures and Their Role in Genome Replication and Assembly

    **Research Question:** How do poliovirus (PV)-induced membranous structures contribute to genome replication and assembly, and what is the role of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) in this process?

    **Methods:** We used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, to study the formation of PV-induced membranous structures. We monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI4P during PV infection using immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

    **Main Findings:** We observed that changes to the PI4P pool occurred as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor. PI4P remodeling was accompanied by the formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 hours post-infection, a time too slow for these structures to be responsible for genome replication. Delays in the onset of genome replication observed for EG and GG PVs were similar to the delays in virus-induced remodeling of PI4P pools, consistent with PI4P serving as a marker of the genome-replication organelle.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that PV induces temporally distinct membranous structures (organelles) for genome replication (tubules) and virus assembly (vesicular clusters). The pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be set by both the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins. The inability of GG PV to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters may explain the nearly 5-log reduction in infectious virus produced by this mutant.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the temporal dynamics of PV-induced membranous structures and their role in genome replication and assembly. We propose that PI4P serves as a marker of the genome-replication organelle and that vesicular clusters serve as an assembly organelle. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of PV replication and assembly and may inform the development of antiviral strategies.

    Title: Identification of Novel Non-Peptidic Cruzain Inhibitors with Trypanocidal Activity against Chagas Disease

    Research Question: Can a multi-step cascade strategy using integrated ligand- and target-based virtual screening methods identify novel non-peptidic cruzain inhibitors with trypanocidal activity against Chagas disease?

    Methods: We employed a multi-step cascade strategy involving virtual screening of the ZINC database using ligand- and target-based virtual screening methods, followed by enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to identify novel non-peptidic cruzain inhibitors.

    Main Findings: We identified 12 non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with affinity values in the low micromolar range (3–60 µM) acting through a competitive inhibition mechanism. X-ray crystallographic studies confirmed the binding mode of the cruzain inhibitor Nequimed176. We also found that these inhibitors showed poor selectivity towards cruzain, raising the possibility of investigating them for their effect on cell proliferation. Two compounds were found to have trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi-infected cells. The most potent cruzain inhibitor, Nequimed42, had an IC50 value of 10.6±0.1 µM against the trypomastigote form of the Tulahuen lacZ strain, tenfold lower than that obtained for benznidazole.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the 2-acetamidothiophene-3-carboxamide group is essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition activities. We also identified a smaller compound, Nequimed176, with a ligand efficiency of 0.33 kcal mol−1 atom−1 as a novel non-peptidic, non-covalent cruzain inhibitor as a trypanocidal agent candidate for optimization.

    Conclusions: We present a new hit, 2-acetamidothiophene-3-carboxamide, that non-covalently inhibits cruzain, has trypanocidal activity, and manageable structure-activity and structure-toxicity relationships. This compound is expected to advance the lead optimization process for Chagas disease chemotherapy. Our study highlights the potential of integrated in silico and in vitro approaches, with X-ray crystallography as an orthogonal tool, to discover new non-peptidic hits with trypanocidal activity against cruzain.

    **Title:** Development of Non-Viral DNA-Based Antigen Formulations for Yellow Fever Vaccine

    **Research Question:** Can non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations induce strong T-cell and humoral immune responses against Yellow Fever (YF) virus, providing protection against lethal challenge?

    **Methods:** Two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations, p/YFE and pL/YFE, were designed to express the full-length envelope protein of YF virus, either as a wild-type or fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal, LAMP-1. The immune responses triggered by these formulations were evaluated in H2b and H2d backgrounds, corresponding to C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice strains, respectively.

    **Main Findings:** Both DNA constructs induced strong T-cell responses of similar magnitude against almost all epitopes generated by the YF 17DD vaccine. The pL/YFE formulation performed best overall, stimulating high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies comparable to those elicited by the 17DD vaccine. Notably, the pL/YFE vaccine conferred 100% protection against the YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice.

    **Implications:** These results indicate that pL/YFE DNA is an excellent vaccine candidate, offering a promising alternative to the attenuated YF virus vaccine, which can have toxic side effects. The pL/YFE formulation's ability to induce strong T-cell and humoral immune responses, as well as provide complete protection against lethal challenge, makes it an attractive candidate for further developmental studies.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations in inducing robust immune responses against YF virus. The pL/YFE formulation, in particular, shows great promise as a vaccine candidate, warranting further investigation and development. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines against YF virus, which remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas worldwide.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Role of SlmA in Chitin Utilization and Horizontal Gene Transfer in Vibrio cholerae

    **Research Question:** How does the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA regulate chitin utilization and horizontal gene transfer in Vibrio cholerae?

    **Methods:** We employed an unbiased transposon mutant screen to identify SlmA as a regulator of the chb operon, which encodes genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of the chitin disaccharide chitobiose. We used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that SlmA binds directly to the chb operon promoter and is required for transcriptional activation and chitobiose utilization.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that SlmA, a member of the TetR family of proteins, acts as a transcriptional activator of the chb operon in Vibrio cholerae. We show that SlmA binds directly to the promoter region of the chb operon and that this interaction is essential for transcriptional activation and chitobiose utilization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA-binding, but not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for SlmA-mediated transcriptional activation.

    **Implications:** This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in Vibrio cholerae, in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor. Our findings highlight the importance of SlmA in regulating chitin utilization and horizontal gene transfer, which are critical for the persistence and evolution of Vibrio cholerae in the marine environment.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of chitin utilization in Vibrio cholerae and highlights the complex interplay between SlmA and other regulatory proteins, such as ChiS and CBP. The identification of SlmA as a transcriptional activator of the chb operon expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Vibrio-chitin interactions, which are essential for the persistence, transmission, and evolution of this important human pathogen.

    **Title:** Scalable Nonlinear Programming Framework for Dynamic Modeling of Biological Systems

    **Research Question:** Can a novel nonlinear programming (NLP) framework be developed to efficiently solve computationally challenging parameter estimation problems in dynamic modeling of biological systems?

    **Methods:** We propose a cutting-edge NLP framework that leverages time discretization, algebraic model implementations, and computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers to tackle parameter estimation problems in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Our framework exploits sparse and structured linear algebra techniques to achieve high computational efficiency.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by solving parameter estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. Specifically, we show that our framework can solve instances with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points in less than 3 minutes, outperforming off-the-shelf simulation-based solution frameworks that require over 7 hours. Furthermore, we create large instances to demonstrate the scalability of our framework, solving problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes.

    **Implications:** Our framework has significant implications for dynamic modeling of biological systems, enabling the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, perform model selection, and handle outliers. The high computational efficiency achieved with our framework can facilitate kinetic modeling of complex biological systems, including biomolecular networks and high-dimensional microbial communities.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that modern modeling and solution tools can be combined to create scalable, robust, easy-to-use, and flexible frameworks for solving computationally challenging parameter estimation problems in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Our framework can be broadly applied to various biological systems, including microbial communities, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways, and can be used to construct and analyze high-fidelity models of whole-cells or microbiomes.

    **Title:** High-Throughput Digital Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Dynamic Inflammatory Responses to West Nile Virus Infection in Outbred Swiss Webster Mice

    **Research Question:** What are the gene expression changes in multiple tissues of outbred Swiss Webster mice following West Nile virus (WNV) infection, and how do these changes relate to the inflammatory response and viral replication?

    **Methods:** This study employed the nCounter, a high-throughput digital gene expression system, to analyze the expression of 179 inflammation-related genes in multiple tissues (spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain) of WNV-infected outbred Swiss Webster mice over a nine-day course of infection. Gene expression levels were compared to protein expression levels using a multiplex protein detection system (BioPlex).

    **Main Findings:** Expression analysis revealed that Cxcl10 and Il12b were differentially expressed in all tissues except kidney. Data stratification of infected versus non-infected tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response from tissue-specific responses. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in WNV-infected tissues, including upregulation of Stat1, Tlr2, chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl3, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, cytokines Il6, Il18, and cytokine-related gene Il1r in WNV-infected livers. In WNV-infected brain tissues, Csf2 and Cxcl10 were significantly upregulated. Similar gene and protein expression kinetics were found for Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5, which correlated with the presence of infectious virus.

    **Implications:** This study demonstrates the utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes associated with WNV infection in outbred Swiss Webster mice. The findings provide insights into the dynamic gene expression profiles of the inflammatory response in WNV-infected mice, which can inform the development of therapeutic strategies to combat WNV infection.

    **Conclusions:** The nCounter system enabled rapid gene expression profiling of a large number of inflammatory response genes from multiple tissues over the course of WNV infection in an outbred mouse model, allowing for the differentiation between general versus specific gene expression changes in WNV-infected versus non-infected tissues. This study highlights the importance of high-throughput digital gene expression analysis in understanding the complex immune responses elicited by viral infection and the kinetics of viral replication.
Title: Epidemiological Features of Human Rabies and Animal Bites in Maputo and Matola Cities, Mozambique: A Retrospective Study

    Abstract:

    Background: Rabies is a significant public health concern in Mozambique, with most outbreaks going unreported. We investigated the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites in Maputo and Matola cities following an outbreak in 2014.

    Methods: We conducted a retrospective study from April to July 2014, reviewing cases of human rabies and animal bites. A community investigation was conducted in July and August 2014, collecting clinical, demographic, and epidemiological information. A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors associated with human rabies.

    Main Findings: Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected, all with a recent history of dog bites. Only one of the 14 rabid dogs had been immunized. A total of 819 animal bites were registered, with dogs responsible for 97.8% (801/819). Factors significantly associated with human rabies were age <15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis.

    Implications: The study highlights the need for improved control measures for rabies in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies are strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures.

    Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiological features of human rabies and animal bites in Mozambique, contributing to the formulation of appropriate recommendations and strategies to control rabies in the country. The findings emphasize the importance of vaccination, proper wound care, and post-exposure prophylaxis in preventing human rabies.
Title: Identification of SCN9A as a Novel Febrile Seizure Gene and Its Role in Human Epilepsies

    Abstract:

    Background:
    Febrile seizures (FS) are a common childhood condition characterized by seizures triggered by fever. Despite their prevalence, the genetic underpinnings of FS remain poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the genetic basis of FS in a large Utah family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q24.

    Methods:
    We conducted a follow-up study of the Utah family and identified a novel mutation in the SCN9A gene, which encodes the Nav1.7 sodium channel subunit. We introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Scn9a gene using targeted homologous recombination to establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility. We also analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and 109 Dravet syndrome patients to confirm the role of SCN9A in human epilepsies.

    Main Findings:
    We identified a highly conserved amino acid mutation, p.N641Y, in the SCN9A gene in 21 affected family members, which was absent in 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. Homozygous Scn9aN641Y/N641Y knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates. We also identified additional highly conserved Nav1.7 missense variants in 5% of FS patients and 8% of Dravet syndrome patients.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide strong evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations. The SCN9A-N641Y mutation is associated with a wide clinical spectrum of seizure phenotypes, including simple FS, self-limited afebrile seizures, and temporal lobe epilepsy.

    Conclusions:
    This study highlights the importance of SCN9A in central excitability and seizure susceptibility. The identification of SCN9A as a disease-causing gene in FS and its association with Dravet syndrome provides new insights into the genetic basis of human epilepsies. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which SCN9A mutations contribute to seizure susceptibility and to explore the potential therapeutic implications of these findings.

    **Title:** A Polarity-Based Framework for Understanding Complex Tissue Shape Formation: The Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) Framework

    **Research Question:** How do complex tissue shapes arise through growth, and what mechanisms specify the orientations of growth in developing tissues?

    **Methods:** We developed and applied the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, a polarity-based system that treats tissue as a continuous material where regionally expressed factors under genetic control interact and propagate. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions termed tissue polarity organisers, also under genetic control. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are specified through a regulatory network, and the resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the GPT framework can generate a wide range of complex tissue shapes through combinatorial interactions between tissue polarity and differential growth. We illustrate the value of the GPT framework for understanding morphogenesis by applying it to a growing Snapdragon flower. Our models highlight the importance of specifying orientation independently of stresses in the generation of complex tissue shapes. We also show that the polarity-based axiality system has the flexibility to account for global shape changes, observed growth patterns, and clones without invoking large numbers of polarity organisers.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth, a key feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes. The GPT framework provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how complex tissue shapes arise through growth and offers a new perspective on the mechanisms that specify growth orientations in developing tissues.

    **Conclusions:** The GPT framework offers a novel approach to understanding morphogenesis, highlighting the importance of tissue polarity in specifying growth orientations and generating complex tissue shapes. Our results demonstrate the value of a polarity-based system in accounting for global shape changes, observed growth patterns, and clones without invoking large numbers of polarity organisers. The GPT framework provides a foundation for further research into the mechanisms of tissue shape formation and the evolution of complex biological shapes.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Interference in the Emergence of Escape Mutations in HIV Infection

    **Research Question:** Do interference effects between concurrent escape mutations contribute to the observed pattern of decreasing escape rates over time (ERD) in HIV-infected individuals?

    **Methods:** We developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination to simulate the emergence of escape mutations in the presence and absence of interference. We also derived an interference-free null model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response elicitation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern. We found that the number of loci and recombination rates significantly affect ERD, leading to an underexponential decline of escape rates over time. Furthermore, we found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations and interference effects.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations. The challenge in estimating escape rates and mutation-associated selective coefficients posed by interference effects cannot be overcome by improved sampling frequencies or sizes. Instead, novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains, rather than mutation frequencies, are required to account for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that interference between concurrent escape mutations can generate the ERD pattern observed in HIV-infected individuals. The presence of ERD in data can be indicative of interference effects, and our results highlight the need for novel estimation methodologies to account for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations. These findings have important implications for our understanding of HIV evolution and the development of effective therapeutic strategies to combat the virus.

    **Title:** Estimating In Vivo Cell Killing Efficacy of Cisplatin-Based Doublet Regimens in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Mechanistic Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** Can a mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment be used to estimate the in vivo cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients?

    **Methods:** A discrete event-discrete state, clinically oriented simulation model of tumor response to chemotherapy was applied to translate tumor shrinkage after treatment to cytotoxic efficacy, taking into account the effect of tumor kinetics on treatment outcome. The model incorporated cancer-related mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. Tumor volumetric data from 13 NSCLC patients who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context were retrospectively analyzed. A comprehensive literature survey on cancer-specific proliferation kinetics guided the selection of model input values, while Latin hypercube sampling was used to compensate for patient-specific uncertainties.

    **Main Findings:** The mechanistic model estimated a range of plausible values for the cell killing efficacy of chemotherapy, expressed as the sum of cell kill rates (CKRsum) of the two drugs considered. Sensitivity analysis using one-factor-at-a-time and Latin hypercube sampling/partial rank correlation coefficient approaches identified tumor volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis as key features for more accurate estimates.

    **Implications:** This study provides a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies in NSCLC patients. Correlation studies of these estimates with molecular profiles of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.

    **Conclusions:** The present work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic modeling to estimate the in vivo cell killing efficacy of chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. The developed methodology can be applied to other cancer types and treatment regimens, providing a valuable tool for clinicians to optimize treatment protocols and improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the potential of this approach for personalized medicine.

    **Title:** Molecular Mechanisms of Biofilm-Specific Antibiotic Tolerance Revealed by Random Transposon Mutagenesis

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the reversible and transient antibiotic tolerance displayed by biofilm bacteria?

    **Methods:** We employed random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific tolerant mutants in Escherichia coli, a model organism. We screened for amino acid auxotroph mutants that form biofilms with increased tolerance to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrated that starved biofilms exhibited significantly greater tolerance to ofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. The biofilm-associated tolerance to ofloxacin was fully dependent on a functional SOS response upon starvation to both amino acids and carbon source, and partially dependent on the stringent response upon leucine starvation. Notably, the biofilm-specific ofloxacin tolerance did not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin-antitoxin systems previously associated with the formation of highly tolerant persisters.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal that the SOS stress response induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin. This finding has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat biofilm-associated infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the reversible and transient antibiotic tolerance displayed by biofilm bacteria. The identification of the SOS response as a key player in biofilm-specific ofloxacin tolerance highlights the importance of understanding the complex physiological heterogeneity of biofilms. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat biofilm-associated infections, which are a major public health concern. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying biofilm-specific antibiotic tolerance and to develop effective treatments for biofilm-associated infections.
Title: Identification of cAMP as a Key Regulator of Microneme Secretion in Plasmodium falciparum Merozoites

    Abstract:
    Background: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a devastating disease caused by the invasion of erythrocytes by parasite-infected merozoites. The invasion process is mediated by specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes.

    Research Question: What is the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the regulation of microneme secretion during Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion of erythrocytes?

    Methods: We used a combination of biochemical and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of cAMP in microneme secretion. We exposed P. falciparum merozoites to a low K+ environment, typical of blood plasma, and measured the resulting changes in cAMP levels and microneme secretion.

    Main Findings: We demonstrate that exposure to a low K+ environment activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenylyl cyclase, PfACβ, leading to a rise in cytosolic cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which regulates microneme secretion. We also show that cAMP regulates merozoite cytosolic Ca2+ levels via induction of an Epac pathway and that increases in both cAMP and Ca2+ are essential to trigger microneme secretion.

    Implications: Our findings provide novel insights into the signaling pathways that regulate microneme secretion during Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The identification of cAMP as a key regulator of microneme secretion offers potential targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent malaria.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that cAMP plays a critical role in the regulation of microneme secretion during Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The identification of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways provides new avenues for the development of antimalarial therapies that target the blood stage of the parasite life cycle.
Title: Global Prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 20 Years of Research

Abstract:

Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted nematode, is one of the most neglected among the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Despite its global distribution, estimates of its prevalence are often based on limited data. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the global prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in general populations and risk groups over the past 20 years. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles published between January 1989 and October 2011. A total of 354 studies from 78 countries were included, with 194 (62.4%) being community-based, 121 (34.2%) hospital-based, and 39 (11.0%) studies on refugees and immigrants. A Bayesian meta-analysis was performed to obtain country-specific prevalence estimates and to compare disease odds ratios in different risk groups, taking into account the sensitivities of the diagnostic methods applied.

The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between HIV-infection and S. stercoralis infection (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.18-4.01), as well as between alcoholism and S. stercoralis infection (OR: 6.69, 95% CI: 1.47-33.8). Our findings indicate high infection prevalence rates in the general population in selected countries and geographical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and South America. Notably, S. stercoralis infection is prominent in several risk groups, including refugees, immigrants, and individuals with HIV-infection or alcoholism. However, adequate information on prevalence is still lacking from many countries, highlighting the need for further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings.

The results of this study underscore the importance of integrating S. stercoralis control into global helminth control programs. Moreover, the findings have implications for medical services in developed countries, where strongyloidiasis remains an issue for immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from deployment in endemic areas. Systematic screening after visits to endemic countries and before initiation of immunosuppressive treatment may be warranted. Further large-scale surveys that sample the general population and use highly sensitive methods over three consecutive days are necessary to narrow the gap in data on global S. stercoralis infection rates.

    **Title:** Quantifying Stochastic Noise in Circadian Oscillations using Population-Level Bioluminescence Recordings

    **Research Question:** Can the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings be used as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise in circadian oscillations, and can this method be applied to high-throughput circadian screens?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel approach to quantify stochastic noise in circadian oscillations by analyzing the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings. We used cell-autonomous fibroblast data to demonstrate that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. We also showed that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, and confirmed that such a change can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise, and that this method can be applied to future and existing high-throughput circadian screens. We further showed that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase, and that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly with regard to the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics. By applying our method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, we revealed that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying circadian oscillations.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can be used as a reliable measure of stochastic noise in circadian oscillations, and that this method can be applied to high-throughput circadian screens. Our findings have important implications for the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics and highlight the need to consider the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise.

    **Title:** Species-Specific Binding of Allosteric Inhibitor PC190723 to Bacterial Cytoskeletal Protein FtsZ

    **Research Question:** How does the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket vary across different bacterial species, and what implications does this have for the development of FtsZ inhibitors?

    **Methods:** We employed the statistical method PocketFEATURE to score the similarity between pairs of small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure information about the local microenvironment. We also conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the structural properties of the binding site in Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ bound to GTP or with mutations that confer PC190723 resistance.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. We predict that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state. Furthermore, MD simulations of an FtsZ dimer indicated that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for the development of FtsZ inhibitors, as they suggest that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states. This information can aid in the design of alternative mutants with equivalent structural and chemical features.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of evaluating the 3D environment of a drug-binding pocket to illuminate the molecular properties and mechanisms governing drug-protein interactions. The prediction that PC190723 has high affinity for its binding pocket in FtsZ structures from the Staphylococcus species but not in FtsZ from other species has significant implications for its development as a future therapeutic. Our results demonstrate the utility of PocketFEATURE in distinguishing aspects of the drug-binding pocket in FtsZ structures from different species and in evaluating how protein pockets in molecules from resistant mutants may differ from the optimal binding structure.

    **Title:** Crystal Structure of HIV-2 Integrase in Complex with Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF) Reveals Critical Interactions for Lentiviral DNA Integration

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of the high-affinity interaction between lentiviral integrase (IN) and lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), and how does this interaction facilitate lentiviral DNA integration?

    **Methods:** We determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains (NTD and CCD) of HIV-2 IN in complex with the IN-binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF using X-ray crystallography.

    **Main Findings:** Our structure reveals a constellation of charge-charge interactions between the NTD of IN and the IBD of LEDGF, which are critical for the stimulation of concerted lentiviral DNA integration by LEDGF in vitro and during the early steps of HIV-1 replication. We also show that mutations of positively charged residues on the IBD severely affect interaction with all lentiviral INs tested. Furthermore, we engineered a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a structural basis for the high-affinity interaction between lentiviral IN and LEDGF, which is essential for the integration of lentiviral DNA into host chromatin. This interaction is critical for the efficient replication of lentiviruses, including HIV-1. Our results also pave the way for the development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies for gene therapy.

    **Conclusions:** The crystal structure of HIV-2 IN in complex with LEDGF reveals the molecular basis of the high-affinity interaction between these two proteins. Our findings highlight the importance of charge-charge interactions between the NTD of IN and the IBD of LEDGF for the stimulation of lentiviral DNA integration. The development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies has the potential to inhibit lentiviral replication and may provide a novel approach for the treatment of HIV-1 and other lentiviral infections.

    **Title:** Investigating the Evolutionary Trajectories of Cancer Stem Cell Kinetics in Tumor Progression

    **Research Question:** How do the intrinsic kinetics of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non-stem cancer cells (CCs) contribute to the emergence of intratumoral heterogeneity and aggressive tumor growth?

    **Methods:** We developed a cellular automaton model to track the temporal evolution of CSCs and CCs, incorporating orthogonal cell traits such as cell migration, spontaneous cell death, symmetric CSC division, and telomere length and erosion. We explored the effects of these traits on tumor growth and progression.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increases in proliferation potential lead to larger populations of CCs, which compete with CSCs and inhibit CSC division. Conversely, reductions in proliferation potential loosen this inhibition, facilitating frequent CSC division. The sub-population of CSCs becomes highly heterogeneous, dictating population-level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the clonal diversity captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes. This highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay of CSC and CC kinetics in understanding tumor progression.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a theoretical framework for investigating tumor progression in response to CSC evolution. We identify a set of orthogonal cell kinetics that modulate tumor growth, including cell migration rate, proliferation potential, spontaneous cell death, and symmetric CSC division. Our results support previous observations that increased cell death counteracts cancer stem cell confinement and promotes self-metastatic tumor expansion. The complex interplay of these dynamics requires further investigation to determine which combinations of simultaneously evolving kinetics yield the most aggressive tumor clones. Ultimately, our study highlights the importance of considering the intrinsic kinetics of CSCs and CCs in understanding the emergence of intratumoral heterogeneity and aggressive tumor growth.

    **Title:** The Limited Impact of Spatial Heterogeneity on the Emergence of Zoonotic Infectious Diseases

    **Research Question:** How does spatial heterogeneity within the human population influence the emergence and spread of zoonotic infectious diseases, such as influenza A (H5N1)?

    **Methods:** We employed simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios, focusing on spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We derived analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction and the waiting time to a successful emergence event. We also compared our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions and the risk of emergence per introduction. Specifically, if a village is connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day, it is effectively part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We also found that the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections. We conclude that only the most remote rural communities would be subject to epidemiological isolation. However, other factors such as human contact patterns and host heterogeneity may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that spatial heterogeneity has a limited impact on the probability of emergence and outbreak size distribution. The biology of the novel pathogen determines the emergence process, and outbreak sizes group according to the intermediate average reproductive number. We expect the existence of a threshold where spatial heterogeneity effectively does not matter anymore. Our results provide new insights into the epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases and highlight the importance of considering the evolutionary biology of host adaptation in the context of emerging infections.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Dynamics of Avian Influenza Virus Spread in North American Wild Birds: A 34-Year Surveillance Study

    **Research Question:** What are the patterns of avian influenza A virus (AIV) migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment in North American wild birds, and how do these dynamics impact the emergence of human and livestock influenza?

    **Methods:** We analyzed genomic data from 287 newly sequenced AIV samples isolated over a 34-year period of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds. We employed a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population structure, and patterns of genetic reassortment.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that despite the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay, this host population does not significantly contribute to the North American AIV diversity sampled in Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. We found that AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, but our large-scale analysis showed that the long-term persistence of AIV is independent of bird flyways, with migration between populations occurring throughout North America.

    **Implications:** Our study provides vital insights into the dynamics of AIV spread in wild birds, which are critical for developing predictive models for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. Our findings suggest that the long-term persistence of AIV in North America is not solely dependent on migratory flyways, but rather on the complex interactions between host populations.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of large-scale, long-term surveillance data in understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of viral movement between migrating bird populations. Our results highlight the significance of Anseriformes' social behavior in facilitating the spread and generation of influenza virus genetic diversity. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of effective strategies to mitigate the risk of AIV emergence and transmission to humans and livestock.
Title: Identification of a Novel Monoclonal Antibody with Heterosubtypic Cross-Reactivity to Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin

    Abstract:
    Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 distinct subtypes based on their hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoproteins, with limited cross-reactivity among subtypes. Here, we report the generation of a novel monoclonal antibody (MAb) S139/1, which exhibits heterosubtypic cross-reactivity to multiple HA subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13). MAb S139/1 was found to neutralize and inhibit hemagglutination of various influenza A virus strains, including H1, H2, H3, and H13 subtypes. Sequence analysis of escape mutants revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193, which formed a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain of HA. Molecular modeling studies confirmed the location of these amino acids on the globular head of HA. Passive immunization of mice with MAb S139/1 provided heterosubtypic protection against influenza A virus infection. These findings demonstrate that MAb S139/1 binds to a common antigenic site shared among various HA subtypes, neutralizing viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo by blocking viral attachment to cells. Our results support the notion that cross-reactive antibodies play a role in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection and highlight the potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza.

    Research Question:
    Can a monoclonal antibody be generated that exhibits heterosubtypic cross-reactivity to multiple HA subtypes of influenza A viruses?

    Methods:
    We generated a novel monoclonal antibody (MAb) S139/1, which was originally produced as an H3 HA-specific antibody. The cross-reactivity of MAb S139/1 to multiple subtypes of influenza A virus HAs was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using several H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13 subtypes.

    Main Findings:
    MAb S139/1 was found to neutralize and inhibit hemagglutination of various influenza A virus strains, including H1, H2, H3, and H13 subtypes. Sequence analysis of escape mutants revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193, which formed a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain of HA. Molecular modeling studies confirmed the location of these amino acids on the globular head of HA. Passive immunization of mice with MAb S139/1 provided heterosubtypic protection against influenza A virus infection.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that MAb S139/1 binds to a common antigenic site shared among various HA subtypes, neutralizing viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo by blocking viral attachment to cells. These results support the notion that cross-reactive antibodies play a role in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection and highlight the potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza.

    Conclusions:
    We have identified a novel monoclonal antibody (MAb S139/1) with heterosubtypic cross-reactivity to multiple HA subtypes of influenza A viruses. Our results demonstrate the potential of MAb S139/1 as a therapeutic agent against influenza A virus infection and underscore the importance of cross-reactive antibodies in heterosubtypic immunity.

    **Title:** Efficacy of Ivermectin Treatment in Reducing the Prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis Infection in an Australian Aboriginal Population: A Three-Year Cohort Study

    **Background:** Strongyloides stercoralis infection is a significant public health concern in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, with high prevalence rates reported in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in reducing the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population over a three-year period and to evaluate the validity of using a lower ELISA cut-off in diagnosis.

    **Methods:** This three-year cohort study enrolled 259 adult Australian Aboriginals living in a remote community in northern Australia. S. stercoralis infection was diagnosed using commercial ELISA testing with a lower threshold for treatment than recommended. Follow-up was conducted at 6 months and 3 years following ivermectin treatment.

    **Main Findings:** Treatment with ivermectin resulted in a significant and sustained reduction in the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection, from 35.3% at baseline to 5.8% at 3 years (McNemar’s chi2 = 56.5, p < 0.001). The use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was found to be valid in this setting. However, a small group of subjects with persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment was identified.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that control of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort is feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. The results of this study provide evidence that a "case finding and treatment" approach can be an effective strategy for controlling chronic S. stercoralis infection in adult Aboriginal populations.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population over a three-year period. The findings support the use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment in this setting and highlight the potential for control of S. stercoralis infection through pharmacological treatment alone.

    **Title:** Lack of Strain Interference between Long-Incubation Period Prion Strains: Implications for Prion Strain Dynamics and Emergence

    **Background:** Prion diseases are caused by misfolded isoforms of the prion protein, PrPSc. Prion strains are thought to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrPSc, and prions can interfere with each other when a long-incubation period strain (blocking strain) inhibits the conversion of a short-incubation period strain (non-blocking strain). However, it is unknown whether two long-incubation period strains can interfere with each other.

    **Research Question:** Can two long-incubation period prion strains interfere with each other in vivo and in vitro?

    **Methods:** We co-infected animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains and used protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi) to assess strain interference.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that co-infection of animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains failed to identify evidence of strain interference. Consistent with the animal bioassay studies, PMCAsi indicated that both co-infecting strains were amplifying independently, suggesting that the lack of strain interference is not due to a failure to target the same cells but is an inherent property of the strains involved.

    **Implications:** Our findings change the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains and have implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture. We propose that the abundance of PrPC is not limiting in vivo or in vitro, resulting in prion strains with relatively low prion conversion efficiency to amplify independently.

    **Conclusions:** Our results suggest that not all prion strain combinations result in interference, and strain diversity in naturally-infected animals may be greater than previously thought. The lack of strain interference between long-incubation period prion strains has significant implications for our understanding of prion strain dynamics and emergence, and highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying prion strain interactions.

Title: Revisiting the Role of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/Regions in Allosteric Regulation: A Comprehensive Ensemble Model

Background: Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, and it was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing allosteric coupling. However, the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation remains unclear.

Research Question: What is the relative importance of order-order transition and disorder-order transition in allosteric effect, and how do IDPs/IDRs contribute to allosteric regulation?

Methods: We propose a comprehensive ensemble model that combines the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) pathway (order-order transition) and the Ensemble Allostery Model (EAM) pathway (disorder-order transition) to investigate the roles of both transitions in allosteric effect.

Main Findings: Our results show that the MWC pathway has a higher probability than the EAM pathway in allostery, suggesting a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins. We also derive an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which reveals that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable for endowing allostery.

Implications: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation is more complex than previously thought. The EAM model provides insight into why IDPs/IDRs are prevalent in allosteric regulation, but our comprehensive ensemble model reveals that the order-disorder transition is less competitive than the order-order transition in affording allosteric effects.

Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of considering both order-order and disorder-order transitions in understanding the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation. The prevalence of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation is likely due to their ability to implement allosteric effect under the lack of ordered structures, which is related to an emerging new view of allostery based on the general landscape theory of protein structure. Further work combining experimental data and bioinformatics analyses is needed to compare the importance of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation.

    **Title:** β-Catenin’s Dual Role in Prostate Development and Cancer Progression

    **Research Question:** What is the role of β-Catenin in prostate development and cancer progression, and how does its dysregulation contribute to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer?

    **Methods:** We employed in vivo genetic studies in embryonic and adult mice to investigate the function of β-Catenin in the normal and neoplastic prostate. Gene deletion and overexpression analyses were performed to elucidate the role of β-Catenin in prostate development and cancer progression.

    **Main Findings:** Our studies revealed that β-Catenin is essential for embryonic prostate growth and branching, controlling the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds and regulating a discrete network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. However, in the adult prostate, β-Catenin is dispensable for normal organ function. Notably, deletion of β-Catenin in a Pten-deleted model of castration-resistant prostate cancer showed that it is dispensable for disease progression in this setting. Conversely, β-Catenin overexpression, achieved through in vivo protein stabilization, promoted the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. Furthermore, β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss drove progression to invasive carcinoma together with squamous metaplasia.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that β-Catenin plays a dual role in prostate development and cancer progression. Its dysregulation can lead to the formation of squamous epithelia and promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease. These data provide novel insights into cancer progression pathways that give rise to lethal prostate disease in humans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of β-Catenin in prostate development and its potential role in prostate cancer initiation and progression. The findings suggest that β-Catenin overexpression, particularly in combination with Pten loss, can drive the formation of squamous epithelia and promote invasive prostate cancer. These results have significant implications for our understanding of prostate cancer biology and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting β-Catenin and its downstream effectors.

    Title: Exploring Factors Influencing Informed Consent in a Rural Ethiopian Population: A Qualitative Study on Podoconiosis Research

    Background: Informed consent is a crucial aspect of biomedical research, particularly in developing countries where disease burden is high. Understanding local factors influencing informed consent is essential for conducting ethical research. This study aimed to investigate factors related to information and communication during the informed consent process in a rural Ethiopian population affected by podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis).

    Methods: A qualitative study was conducted prior to a family-based genetic study among podoconiosis patients in southern Ethiopia. We adapted a rapid assessment method validated in The Gambia, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoconiosis patients, non-patients, fieldworkers, researchers, local NGO staff, and community leaders.

    Main Findings: Our study revealed that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and presentation techniques significantly impacted comprehension of research information. Approaching podoconiosis patients through locally trusted individuals and preceding individual consent with community sensitization were considered optimal communication strategies. Poverty, lack of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local NGO were identified as potential barriers to obtaining genuine informed consent.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes on a study-by-study basis to ensure that information is provided in a comprehensible manner and supports voluntary decision-making. The study highlights the importance of understanding the social and cultural context of the community and potential research participants before seeking informed consent.

    Conclusions: This study provides practical insights into the determinants of and approaches to gaining informed consent in a predominantly rural Ethiopian population. Our results emphasize the need for researchers to adapt their communication strategies to the local context, using everyday language and involving trusted community members in the consent process. By doing so, researchers can increase the likelihood of obtaining genuine informed consent and conducting ethical research in developing countries.

    **Title:** Investigating the Impact of Genetics and Aging on T Lymphocyte Proliferation Dynamics in the Immune System

    **Research Question:** How do genetics and aging influence the proliferation dynamics of T lymphocytes across their differentiation stages in the thymus and spleen?

    **Methods:** We employed single-cell multicolour flow cytometry analysis to quantify the active incorporation of a thymidine analogue during S phase after pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo, versus cell DNA content. A generic mathematical model of state transition, simulated using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), was developed to simulate the evolution of single cell behaviour during various durations of labelling. This model allowed us to fit our data, deduce proliferation rates, and estimate cell cycle durations in sub-populations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, with a specific "signature" that depends on genetic origins, is specific to cell differentiation stages in the thymus and spleen, and is altered with age. We found that FVB mice have significantly lower rates of T cell proliferation than C57BL/6 mice in both the thymus and spleen. Our model also allowed us to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from complex experimental data, revealing T cell proliferation heterogeneity and specific signatures.

    **Implications:** This study provides a detailed proliferation assessment and cell quantification in subpopulations of T cells, along their differentiation from the thymus to the spleen, and through aging. Our findings suggest that genetic origin and age drive a particular "signature" of proliferation and cycle phase durations, according to T cell differentiation stage and T cell lineage. These results have important implications for our understanding of the immune system's maintenance of body integrity and the impact of aging on immune function.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our model allows us to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from complex experimental data, revealing T cell proliferation heterogeneity and specific signatures. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of T lymphocyte proliferation and highlights the importance of considering genetic and age-related factors in understanding immune system function.
Title: Generation and Characterization of a Mitochondrial tRNA Pathological Mutation in Mouse Cells: Insights into the Evolution and Fixation of Mitochondrial tRNA Mutations

Abstract:
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are a leading cause of human diseases, with approximately half of these mutations occurring in transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Notably, some pathogenic tRNA mutations can reach homoplasmy, yet exhibit variable penetrance among patients. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we generated and characterized the first mitochondrial tRNA pathological mutation in mouse cells, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene. This mutation recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation described in humans, an m. 4290T>C transition affecting the human mt-Ti gene. Our results demonstrate that the pathogenic mechanism induced by both the mouse and human mutations is a high frequency of abnormal folding of the tRNAIle that cannot be charged with isoleucine. Furthermore, we show that cells harboring the mouse or human mutant tRNA exhibit exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as a compensatory response. We propose that the nature of the pathogenic mechanism combined with the existence of a compensatory mechanism can explain the penetrance pattern of this mutation, allowing for the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs in which the fixation of two deleterious alleles can proceed in two steps, rather than requiring simultaneous mutation of both. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial tRNA mutations and have implications for understanding the evolution and fixation of these mutations in humans.

    **Title:** Dosage Compensation of X-linked Genes in Human Triploid Cells: Evidence for Epigenetic Regulation

    **Research Question:** How does dosage compensation of X-linked genes respond to changes in ploidy in human triploid cells?

    **Methods:** We used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells with one or two active X chromosomes and diploid cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the average X:autosome expression ratio is lower in triploid cells with one active X (0.81-0.84) and higher in triploid cells with two active X's (1.32-1.4) compared to diploid cells (1). This suggests that X-linked gene expression is not strictly adjusted to achieve a perfect balance in response to autosomal factors. Furthermore, we found that absolute autosomal expression levels per gene copy are similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no global effect on autosomal expression. However, in triploid cells with two active X's, our data support a basic doubling of X-linked gene expression. In contrast, in triploid cells with a single active X, X-linked gene expression is adjusted upward, presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that dosage compensation of X-linked genes in human triploid cells is not strictly regulated by autosomal factors, but rather by an epigenetic mechanism that adjusts X-linked gene expression in response to changes in ploidy. This mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression is critical.

    **Conclusions:** Our results indicate that X-linked gene expression is up-regulated approximately two-fold in triploid cultures with two active X chromosomes, similar to diploid cultures. However, in triploid cultures with a single active X, X expression is adjusted further upward, although not tripled. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of X-linked gene expression in human triploid cells and suggest that epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in dosage compensation of X-linked genes in response to changes in ploidy.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the dN/dS Ratio in the Context of Population Genetics: Implications for Inferring Selection Pressures

    **Research Question:** How does the dN/dS ratio, a widely used measure of evolutionary pressures on proteins, behave in the context of samples drawn from a single population, and what are the implications for inferring selection pressures?

    **Methods:** Using theoretical analysis and simulations, we investigated the relationship between selection pressures and the dN/dS ratio in samples from a single population, contrasting it with the behavior of the dN/dS ratio in samples from divergent lineages.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient in the context of a single population, and the hallmark signature of positive selection (dN/dS > 1) is violated within a population. Furthermore, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function in population samples, making it challenging to infer selection pressures from dN/dS measurements.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples. Standard tests for selection based on dN/dS are extremely sensitive to the assumption of divergent lineages, and the relationship between selection and dN/dS is qualitatively different for samples drawn from a single population compared to samples from divergent lineages.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the limitations of using the dN/dS ratio to infer selection pressures in the context of population genetics. We demonstrate that the dN/dS ratio is not a reliable indicator of selection pressures in samples from a single population, and caution against the use of standard tests for selection based on dN/dS in this context. Our results emphasize the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between selection pressures and the dN/dS statistic in population-genetic samples.

    **Title:** Indirect Effects of Natural Selection on Linked Neutral Divergence between Closely and Distantly Related Species

    **Research Question:** How does natural selection influence patterns of genetic variation across genomes, particularly at linked neutral sites, between closely and distantly related species?

    **Methods:** We examined the relationship between neutral genetic divergence and functional content, recombination rates, and background selection in human, primate, and rodent species. We used a combination of empirical and simulation-based approaches, including coalescent models, to investigate the effects of natural selection on linked neutral divergence.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that neutral divergence between closely related species (e.g., human-primate) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. Similarly, neutral divergence between distantly related species (e.g., human-rodent) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors such as hypermutable CpG sites, GC content, and biased gene conversion.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. Background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome, generating the observed correlations. While we cannot formally exclude the possibility that direct effects of purifying selection drive some of these patterns, our results indicate that more of the genome is under purifying selection than currently believed.

    **Conclusions:** Our study has significant implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation. The view that selection does not affect divergence at linked neutral sites between distantly diverged species should be reconsidered. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for background selection in the ancestral population when studying the evolution of genomes.

    **Title:** CK2 Kinase Regulates CLOCK Transcriptional Activity and Stability in the Drosophila Circadian Clock

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the CK2 kinase in regulating CLOCK (CLK) transcriptional activity and stability in the Drosophila circadian clock?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology and biochemical techniques to investigate the effects of CK2 kinase activity on CLK stability and transcriptional activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to downregulate the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 (CK2α) and the regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme (CK2β). We then analyzed the effects of CK2α and CK2β downregulation on CLK stability, phosphorylation, and transcriptional activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that downregulation of CK2α activity induces CLK degradation, even in the absence of PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins, which are known to inhibit CLK transcriptional activity. Unexpectedly, the regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme (CK2β) is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. Furthermore, downregulation of CK2α activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription. These findings indicate that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that CK2 plays a key role in regulating CLK stability and transcriptional activity in the Drosophila circadian clock. The counteracting effects of CK2 and CK1 kinases on CLK stability and activity may be crucial for setting the proper phase of CLK transcriptional activity in the circadian cycle.

    **Conclusions:** Our study defines CK2 as the first bona fide kinase of Drosophila CLK that plays a role in its degradation and hyperphosphorylation. We propose that CK2 promotes CLK stability and decreases its activity, which may interact with DBT-dependent kinase activities to set CLK transcriptional activity to a proper phase in the circadian cycle. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the Drosophila circadian clock and have implications for the regulation of circadian oscillations in other organisms.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Cruzipain in the Interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi and Rhodnius prolixus

    **Background:** Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, relies on cysteine peptidases, including cruzipain, for various aspects of its life cycle. However, the role of cruzipain in the parasite-insect host interaction remains poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** Do cysteine peptidase inhibitors and anti-cruzipain antibodies affect the adhesion of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes to Rhodnius prolixus posterior midgut?

    **Methods:** We treated T. cruzi epimastigotes with anti-cruzipain antibodies or a panel of cysteine peptidase inhibitors (cystatin, antipain, E-64, leupeptin, iodocetamide, or CA-074-OMe) and analyzed their effect on parasite adhesion to R. prolixus midgut ex vivo.

    **Main Findings:** All treatments, except CA-074-OMe, significantly decreased parasite adhesion to R. prolixus midgut. Cystatin showed a dose-dependent reduction in adhesion. Transgenic epimastigotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, adhered to the insect gut 73% less than wild-type parasites. The adhesion of chagasin-overexpressing parasites was partially restored by the addition of exogenous cruzipain. In vivo colonization experiments revealed low levels of chagasin-overexpressing parasites in comparison to wild-type.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the role of cruzipain in the interaction between T. cruzi and the insect host. Cruzipain contributes to the adhesion of T. cruzi to R. prolixus midgut, suggesting that cysteine peptidase inhibitors may be a potential target for Chagas' disease chemotherapy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that cruzipain plays a crucial role in the interaction between T. cruzi and R. prolixus. The use of cysteine peptidase inhibitors and transgenic parasites overexpressing chagasin provides a novel approach to understanding the role of cruzipain in the parasite-insect host interaction. These findings have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Chagas' disease.

    **Title:** Identification of Conserved Non-Essential Genes that Regulate Cytoplasmic Dynein Function in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms that target and regulate cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule-dependent motor protein essential for various cellular processes, including mitosis?

    **Methods:** We employed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) library to screen a conditional Caenorhabditis elegans cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature. This approach allowed us to identify 20 dynein-specific suppressor genes that, when reduced in function, suppressed the dynein mutant but not other conditionally mutant loci.

    **Main Findings:** We found that 12 of the 20 suppressor genes do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type worms. Many of the suppressor proteins, including two dynein light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for the dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains (ACs) suppresses the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some ACs negatively regulate heavy chain function. We also identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, suppress conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis. The identification of these genes provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.

    **Conclusions:** We have identified 20 genes that, in many cases, are not essential themselves but are conserved and can suppress conditionally lethal C. elegans cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants. Our results highlight the importance of conserved nonessential genes in regulating essential cellular processes, such as mitosis, and provide a starting point for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms that target and regulate cytoplasmic dynein.

    **Title:** Coordination of DNA Cleavage and Double-Strand Break Repair during Programmed Genome Rearrangements in Paramecium tetraurelia

    **Research Question:** How are DNA cleavage and double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways coordinated during programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) in Paramecium tetraurelia?

    **Methods:** We employed RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete Ku70 and Ku80c paralogs in Paramecium tetraurelia and analyzed the effects on IES (Internal Eliminated Sequences) excision and DSB repair. We also co-purified PiggyMac and Ku70a/Ku80c in a heterologous system to investigate their interaction.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus during PGR. Depletion of Ku80c abolished PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage at IES boundaries, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. Furthermore, we found that PiggyMac and Ku70a/Ku80c co-purify as a complex, suggesting a tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first evidence that Ku is required in vivo to introduce programmed DSBs during PGR in Paramecium tetraurelia. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the interplay between DNA cleavage and DSB repair pathways during genome rearrangements.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer plays a crucial role in coordinating DNA cleavage and DSB repair during PGR in Paramecium tetraurelia. The integration of Ku in the DNA cleavage factory enables tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair, ensuring the precise elimination of IESs and the assembly of functional somatic chromosomes. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of PGR and highlights the importance of Ku in safeguarding genome integrity during this process.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Pre-Clinical Transcriptional Response of Hippocampal Neurons to Prion Replication

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular events that accompany early neuronal damage and ultimately lead to neuronal death in prion diseases?

    **Methods:** We employed laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons from mice infected with prions and analyzed their pre-clinical transcriptional response using microarray analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that gene expression within these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity during pre-clinical disease. We identified a major cluster of genes that are altered during pre-clinical disease, which includes genes involved in synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, we found that genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered, culminating in a general decline of gene expression for synaptic proteins. Furthermore, we observed concomitant patterns of expression for deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p, and miR-140-5p.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response that is mediated, at least in part, by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodelling. However, this response is terminated prior to the onset of clinical symptoms in the infected hippocampus, pointing to a critical juncture in the disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first in-depth genomic analysis of the pre-clinical response of hippocampal neurons to early prion replication. Our results highlight the importance of synaptic NMDA receptor activity and neuroprotective pathways in the early stages of prion disease. Manipulation of these early neuroprotective pathways may redress the balance between degeneration and survival, providing a potential inroad for treatment. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression is a powerful tool for understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, and the introduction or knock-down/out of miRNAs may be an avenue for the development of therapeutics.

    **Title:** In Silico Modeling of Leishmania Granuloma Formation and Function Reveals Novel Insights into Anti-Leishmanial Activity and IL-10 Regulation

    **Background:** Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the liver, where the parasite is eventually eliminated. However, the mechanisms underlying granuloma formation and function remain poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** What are the fundamental aspects of granuloma formation and function in experimental visceral leishmaniasis, and how do they contribute to the control of parasite load?

    **Methods:** We developed an in silico Petri net model that simulates hepatic granuloma development throughout the course of infection. The model was extensively validated by comparison with data derived from experimental studies in mice and assessed for robustness through sensitivity analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our in silico model recapitulated the progression of disease as seen during experimental infection and predicted changes in cellular composition within granulomas over time. Notably, we identified a previously unappreciated level of inter-granuloma diversity in terms of anti-leishmanial activity. Furthermore, our data suggest a dominant local regulatory role for IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granuloma.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying granuloma formation and function, shedding light on the role of IL-10 in regulating anti-leishmanial activity. These results have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against visceral leishmaniasis.

    **Conclusions:** Our in silico model of Leishmania granuloma formation and function has provided a unique perspective on the complex interactions between immune cells and the parasite. By simulating the impact of IL-10 gene deficiency in various lymphocyte and myeloid cell populations, we have identified a critical role for IL-10 in regulating anti-leishmanial activity within the granuloma. These findings highlight the potential of in silico modeling to elucidate complex biological processes and inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

    **Title:** Analog Computation in Transcriptional Regulation: Approximating Arithmetic Operations and Beyond

    **Research Question:** Can the transcriptional regulatory machinery of a gene be viewed as a computational device capable of approximating arithmetic operations, and if so, what are the implications for our understanding of transcriptional regulation and biochemical systems?

    **Methods:** We employed a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation to investigate the computational capabilities of transcriptional regulatory networks. By parameterizing the model in different ways, we demonstrated that it can approximate all four standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), as well as various equality and inequality operations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different sets of parameters, which can be independently tuned. We also demonstrated that networks of these "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. Furthermore, we showed that multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter can be used to approximate analytic functions.

    **Implications:** These findings have important implications for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and suggest new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks. They also highlight the potential for transcriptional regulatory networks to perform computations more sophisticated than simple logical operations, which are already being documented experimentally.

    **Conclusions:** Our analysis of the analog computational abilities of transcriptional regulatory networks is a step towards a deeper understanding of transcriptional regulation and biochemical systems. The possibility of arithmetic computations at the level of transcriptional regulation opens up new avenues for the design of synthetic networks and the interpretation of naturally occurring networks. While more complex functions, such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions, can be computed by combinations of arithmetic operations, a more efficient approach may be to approximate directly using more complicated regulatory machinery.

    **Title:** Simultaneous Circulation of Asian/Caribbean and ECSA Genotypes of Chikungunya Virus in Northeast Brazil

    **Background:** Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an RNA virus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes a debilitating febrile illness, Chikungunya fever (CHIKF), in humans. Following its introduction to Brazil in 2014, CHIKV established an urban cycle among large naive human populations, leading to several outbreaks in the Americas.

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic diversity of CHIKV in a recent outbreak in the Northeast region of Brazil, and do both Asian/Caribbean and ECSA genotypes co-circulate in this region?

    **Methods:** We employed an in-house developed Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol to directly sequence CHIKV genomes from clinical positive samples collected during a recent outbreak in the Northeast region of Brazil.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that both Asian/Caribbean and ECSA genotypes of CHIKV are co-circulating in the Northeast region of Brazil, with evidence of simultaneous infection by these two genotypes in at least six clinical samples. This finding suggests that coinfection by different genotypes may be more common than previously thought in highly endemic areas.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the possibility of coinfection by different CHIKV genotypes in the human population when understanding CHIKV epidemiology. This is crucial for developing effective public health strategies to control and prevent the spread of CHIKV.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the genetic diversity of CHIKV in Brazil and highlights the need for further research on the epidemiology and evolution of CHIKV in the Americas. The co-circulation of Asian/Caribbean and ECSA genotypes in the Northeast region of Brazil underscores the complexity of CHIKV transmission dynamics and emphasizes the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring of CHIKV in this region.

    **Title:** Differential Regulation of Core and Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) DNA by the H-NS System in Enteric Bacteria

    **Research Question:** How does the H-NS system, a global modulator of gene expression, interact with and integrate horizontally acquired DNA (HGT) in the regulatory networks of enteric bacteria?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of H-NS, a protein that targets both core genome and HGT genes, in modulating gene expression in response to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. We used a plasmid-encoded H-NS protein (H-NSR27) from Salmonella to selectively silence HGT genes without interfering with core genome regulation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that H-NS discriminates and differentially modulates core and HGT DNA. We found that plasmid-encoded H-NS-like proteins have evolved to selectively target HGT genes, while chromosomally-encoded H-NS targets both HGT and core genomic DNA, but differentially modulates them using Hha-like proteins to specifically silence HGT genes. We also discovered that the presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family and that conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have been isolated only from members of this family.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the H-NS system in enteric bacteria has evolved unique features that enable it to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA. This capacity may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent form, providing a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the H-NS system plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in enteric bacteria by differentially modulating core and HGT DNA. The presence of Hha-like proteins and H-NS-like proteins in conjugative plasmids appears to be an evolutionary trait of the Enterobacteriaceae family, highlighting the importance of this system in host colonization and adaptation to new environments.
Title: Comparative Analysis of Amastigote Gene Expression in Leishmania Species Reveals Limited Regulation and Species-Specific Factors Contributing to Virulence

    Abstract:

    Background: Leishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by Leishmania parasites, which exhibit a range of disease phenotypes in the host. Recent genome sequencing of Leishmania species has revealed conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, with only a small number of genes differentially distributed between species. However, the expression of these genes in the disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes is not well understood.

    Methods: We used customised oligonucleotide microarrays to investigate amastigote gene expression in three Leishmania species: L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis. We probed the arrays with host-derived amastigote RNA isolated from cutaneous lesions, spleens, and RAW 264.7 macrophages.

    Main Findings: Our results show that only ∼9% of the genes analysed are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle, a figure consistent with that observed in other Leishmania species. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species confirms the proposal that Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation, but also identifies conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. Furthermore, we found that host immune competence does not influence parasite gene expression, as RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes derived from either wild-type (BALB/c) or immunologically compromised (Rag2−/− γc−/−) mice are unperturbed.

    Implications: Our findings support the hypothesis that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level. Species-specific parasite factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity in the host may be limited to the products of a small number of differentially distributed genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes, which are subject to translational and/or post-translational controls.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the gene expression profiles of Leishmania amastigotes and highlights the limited regulation of gene expression in these disease-promoting stages. Our findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenicity of Leishmania species and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
Title: Development and Evaluation of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for the Detection of Amphimerus spp. DNA in Human Stool Samples

    Abstract:

    Background: Amphimeriasis, a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp., has been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador, with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. Current diagnosis relies on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, which lacks sensitivity and can be confounded by other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date.

    Research Question: Can a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay be developed and evaluated for the specific and sensitive detection of Amphimerus spp. DNA in human stool samples?

    Methods: A LAMP assay targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of Amphimerus sp. was designed and optimized using DNA obtained from adult worms recovered from animals. Conventional PCR was performed using outer primers F3-B3 to verify the proper amplification of the Amphimerus sp. DNA target sequence. LAMP was optimized using different reaction mixtures and temperatures, and the specificity and sensitivity of both PCR and LAMP were evaluated.

    Main Findings: The LAMP assay, named LAMPhimerus, was shown to have a detection limit of 1 pg of genomic DNA. Field testing using 44 human stool samples collected from localities where the fluke is endemic revealed that 25 samples were microscopy positive for Amphimerus sp. eggs detection. The diagnostic parameters for the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMPhimerus assay were calculated as 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively.

    Implications: The LAMPhimerus assay has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas, particularly in regions with limited resources.

    Conclusions: We have developed and evaluated, for the first time, a specific and sensitive LAMP assay for detecting Amphimerus sp. DNA in human stool samples. The LAMPhimerus method has the potential to improve the diagnosis of amphimeriasis and facilitate disease surveillance in endemic areas. Future large-scale studies will assess the applicability of this novel LAMP assay.

    Title: Ykt6, a Non-Conventional SNARE, Regulates Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion in Drosophila

    Research Question: What is the role of Ykt6 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila, and how does it interact with other SNAREs and the HOPS tethering complex?

    Methods: We used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to investigate the role of Ykt6 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Ykt6 expression in fat cells of starved L3 stage larvae and observed the effects on autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We also used biochemical assays to examine the interactions between Ykt6, other SNAREs, and the HOPS tethering complex.

    Main Findings: Our results show that Ykt6 is essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. Loss of Ykt6 leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes, resulting in impaired autophagic activity. We found that Ykt6 localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes and forms a SNARE complex with Syx17 and Snap29. However, this complex is less stable than the Syx17-Snap29-Vamp7 bundle. We also demonstrated that Ykt6 can be outcompeted from this SNARE complex by Vamp7, and overexpression of Vamp7 rescues the fusion defect in Ykt6 loss-of-function cells.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that Ykt6 plays a non-conventional role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, acting as a regulatory SNARE that interacts with other SNAREs and the HOPS tethering complex. The competition between Ykt6 and Vamp7 for SNARE complex formation with Syx17 and Snap29 highlights the complexity of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion machinery.

    Conclusions: In summary, our study reveals a novel role for Ykt6 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. The discovery of Ykt6 as a non-conventional SNARE provides new insights into the regulation of autophagy and highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between SNAREs and the HOPS tethering complex in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. These findings have implications for our understanding of autophagy in metazoans and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for autophagy-related diseases.
Title: Mechanism of Antimicrobial Peptide Resistance in Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Revealed by SapA-Mediated Import into the Bacterial Cytoplasm

    Abstract:

    Background: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa that can cause opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a critical component of the host innate immune defense against NTHI, but the bacterium has evolved mechanisms to resist their bactericidal effects.

    Research Question: What is the mechanism by which NTHI resists the bactericidal effects of host-derived AMPs?

    Methods: We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the role of SapA, a periplasmic binding protein of the Sap ABC transporter, in NTHI resistance to AMPs. We neutralized AMPs in vivo using affinity-purified antibodies and monitored the consequences of SapA-AMP interaction in intact bacterial cells.

    Main Findings: We demonstrate that SapA directly counteracts AMP lethality during NTHI infection by importing AMPs into the bacterial cytoplasm, where they are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptidase activity. In contrast, AMPs accumulated in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex.

    Implications: Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of SapA-mediated import of AMPs into the bacterial cytoplasm, which reduces periplasmic and inner membrane accumulation of these host defense peptides. This mechanism contributes to NTHI virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo.

    Conclusions: Our study provides the first direct evidence that SapA contributes to NTHI virulence by conferring resistance to AMPs. The SapA-mediated import of AMPs into the bacterial cytoplasm represents a novel strategy for NTHI to evade the host innate immune response. These findings have important implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat NTHI infections.

    **Title:** The Role of Active Degradation in Shaping the Coordination of Downstream Targets by the Multi-Antibiotic Resistance Activator MarA in Escherichia coli

    **Research Question:** How does the half-life of the multi-antibiotic resistance activator MarA influence its ability to coordinate downstream targets in Escherichia coli, and what are the implications for multi-gene regulation?

    **Methods:** We employed CRISPRi to knock down the protease Lon, which targets MarA for degradation, and engineered MarA to protect it from degradation. We analyzed the effects on MarA's half-life, time-series behavior, population statistics, and ability to coordinate downstream genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the half-life of MarA affects both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes. Increasing MarA's half-life enhances the maximum coordinated diversity between downstream genes, but reduces the rate at which coordination is achieved. This trade-off suggests that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist in the context of multi-gene regulation.

    **Implications:** Active degradation of MarA may allow for a more responsive and agile signaling network, enabling a few remaining cells to rapidly regenerate diversity following antibiotic challenge. Alternatively, the capacity of a degraded activator to generate phenotypic diversity may be beneficial for adapting to changing environments.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the utility of active degradation in shaping the coordination of downstream targets by MarA, a key regulator of stress response genes in E. coli. The results demonstrate that the half-life of a regulatory molecule can significantly impact its ability to coordinate downstream genes, and that trade-offs between coordination rate and maximum diversity are inherent in multi-gene regulation. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of regulatory networks in bacteria and the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.

    Title: Revisiting the Role of MAP Kinase Phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in Susceptibility to Leishmania major Infection in C57BL/6 Mice

    Background: Our previous study demonstrated that MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) deficient C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible to Leishmania mexicana infection due to elevated Arginase-1 levels and reduced iNOS activity in macrophages, as well as a diminished TH1 response. However, the role of MKP-2 in susceptibility to Leishmania major infection remains unclear.

    Research Question: Do MKP-2 deficient C57BL/6 mice exhibit increased susceptibility to Leishmania major infection, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    Methods: We infected MKP-2 deficient (MKP-2−/−) and wild-type (MKP-2+/+) C57BL/6 mice with Leishmania major via footpad injection and monitored lesion size and parasite numbers. We also analyzed immune responses, including TH1 and TH2 cytokine production, macrophage activation, and parasite-specific antibody levels.

    Main Findings: Contrary to our previous findings with L. mexicana, MKP-2−/− mice exhibited a healing response to L. major infection, with lesion size and parasite numbers similar to those of MKP-2+/+ mice. However, infected MKP-2−/− mice had reduced TH1 responses, lower parasite-specific serum IgG2b levels, and lower frequencies of IFN-γ and TNF-α producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to MKP-2+/+ mice. Notably, MKP-2−/− macrophages were more permissive to L. major growth, but LPS/IFN-γ activation was equally effective at controlling parasite growth in both MKP-2−/− and MKP-2+/+ macrophages.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the role of MKP-2 in susceptibility to Leishmania infection may be context-dependent, with MKP-2 playing a protective role against L. mexicana but not L. major. The lack of a distinct disease phenotype in MKP-2−/− mice infected with L. major may be due to the suppression of both TH1 and TH2 responses, resulting in an unaltered TH1/TH2 balance.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the complexity of the immune response to Leishmania infection and the need for further investigation into the role of MKP-2 in different Leishmania species. The findings also underscore the importance of considering the context-dependent nature of immune responses in understanding the pathogenesis of Leishmaniasis.

    **Title:** Quantifying Pancreatic Ductal Network Development: Unveiling Stereotypic Traits and Remodeling Mechanisms

    **Research Question:** How does the mammalian pancreas develop its ductal network, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving its stereotypic traits and remodeling?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate the development of the pancreatic ductal network in mice. We analyzed the network properties at different developmental stages (E12.5 to E18.5) and used in silico modeling to deconstruct the main steps of network development into simple rules.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits at each stage of development, despite variations in branch morphology between individual mice. We found that the network properties change systematically as the pancreas matures, optimizing the delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. Using in silico modeling, we identified two simple rules that likely underlie the development of the pancreatic network: (1) noisy, redundant duct formation as new microlumens form, and (2) pruning of the network based on fluid flux into the duodenum.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the development and remodeling of the pancreatic ductal network, shedding light on the mechanisms driving its stereotypic traits. Our findings have implications for understanding the development of other glands that exhibit connecting microlumens, such as the salivary gland. The proposed organ-forming rules are distinct from those described in other organs, such as the lung and mammary gland.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the pancreatic ductal network exhibits stereotypic properties at different developmental stages and undergoes systematic changes as the pancreas matures. By deconstructing the main steps of network development into simple rules, we provide a framework for understanding the development and remodeling of this complex organ. Our findings have the potential to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for pancreatic disorders and contribute to our understanding of organ development more broadly.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Structural Dynamics of Kinesin Motor Proteins: A Comprehensive Analysis of Conformational States and Interconversion Mechanisms

    **Research Question:** How do kinesin motor proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that mediate directed movement along microtubules?

    **Methods:** We employed a comprehensive principal component analysis of 114 experimental structures and conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to map the structural dynamics of the kinesin motor domain. Duplicate 200ns accelerated molecular dynamics simulations were performed to further characterize the intrinsic dynamics of ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free Eg5 kinesin motor domains.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed three distinct conformational clusters (ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound) that differ in the orientation of key functional elements, including the microtubule-binding α4–α5 subdomain, loop8 subdomain, and α2b-β4-β6-β7 motor domain tip. Notably, group membership did not correlate with the nature of the bound nucleotide, but rather with distinct neck-linker orientations. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free Eg5 indicated that all three nucleotide states could sample the major crystallographically observed conformations, with differences in the dynamic coupling of distal sites evident.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the reported ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state, supporting a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions. The simulations also highlight sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and the allosteric coupling between distal functional sites.

    **Conclusions:** Our combined results provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural dynamics of the kinesin motor domain, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying kinesin action. The identification of distinct conformational states and their interconversion mechanisms will facilitate the development of an atomic-level model of kinesin action, ultimately contributing to our understanding of intracellular transport processes.

    **Title:** Deciphering Bioluminescent Signals: A Novel Computational Approach to Infer Gene Transcription Levels from Lux Reporter Assays

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a computational approach to accurately infer gene transcription levels from bioluminescent data generated by Lux reporter assays, accounting for the nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system?

    **Methods:** We developed a new mathematical model for Lux activity, incorporating the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for all reactions, as well as synthesis and turnover of Lux proteins. The model was calibrated with new experimental data for the LuxAB and Fre reactions from Photorhabdus luminescens and literature data for LuxEC.

    **Main Findings:** Our model shows that bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output similar to those observed in experimental data sets. Importantly, we discovered clear evidence for previously unreported product inhibition of the LuxAB reaction by FMNH2. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, we can reverse-engineer promoter activity from bioluminescence data.

    **Implications:** This approach can benefit all users of Lux technology, enabling accurate interpretation of bioluminescent data and providing a more nuanced understanding of gene expression. Our method can also be applied to experiments using sub-lethal doses of antimicrobials, where the Lux reporter system can still be a useful measure of gene expression, including antimicrobial resistance genes.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a novel computational approach to infer gene transcription levels from bioluminescent data generated by Lux reporter assays. Our model addresses the limitations of previous work and provides a more accurate understanding of the nonlinear relationship between gene expression and light output. This breakthrough has significant implications for the use of Lux technology in various fields, including biotechnology, synthetic biology, and biomedical research. By accurately interpreting bioluminescent data, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of gene expression and its regulation, ultimately leading to new insights and discoveries in these fields.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into the Inhibition of Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16 Replication by Capsid Binders

    **Background:** Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are major causative agents of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in children. The development of effective antiviral therapies against these viruses is a pressing need.

    **Research Question:** Can capsid binders inhibit the replication of EV71 and CVA16, and what are the structural features required for effective inhibition?

    **Methods:** We determined the crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with the capsid binder GPP3, which revealed the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. In silico docking was performed to investigate the interactions with two next-generation capsid binders, NLD and ALD, which were shown to be potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses.

    **Main Findings:** The crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with GPP3 revealed the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. In silico docking of NLD and ALD into the CVA16 crystal structure demonstrated a similar binding mode to GPP3. The structural and in silico results were analyzed in the context of the antiviral activity of these inhibitors against a wide range of enteroviruses, showing the potency and broad-spectrum antiviral activity of these molecules.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the hydrophobic pocket below the canyon in VP1 is an interesting target for the development of novel inhibitors that target the early stage of enterovirus infection. The meta-analysis of structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity highlights the potential of NLD as a candidate for a HFMD drug.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides structural insights into the inhibition of EV71 and CVA16 replication by capsid binders and highlights the potential of NLD as a candidate for a HFMD drug. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of novel antiviral therapies against enteroviruses, which are major causative agents of HFMD in children.
Title: Regulation of the Humoral Response to Fungal and Gram-Positive Infections by the Serpin Family Inhibitor Necrotic in Drosophila melanogaster

    Abstract:
    The humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections in Drosophila melanogaster is tightly regulated by the serpin family inhibitor, Necrotic. Following immune challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated, which signals through the Toll receptor, leading to the synthesis of a range of antibiotic peptides in the fat-body and their export to the haemolymph. To elucidate the mechanism of Necrotic turnover, we employed a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis. Our results demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph by two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. We further show that Necrotic is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Notably, mutations that block late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, hk, and car) cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Furthermore, knockdown of the Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA identifies LpR1 as an enhancer of the immune response, and uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. Our findings reveal the cells and receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades, highlighting the importance of Necrotic in controlling the Toll-mediated immune response.

    Title: **BMP Signaling Establishes Left-Right Asymmetry in Sea Urchins**

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of left-right (LR) asymmetry in sea urchin embryos, and how do Nodal and BMP signals interact to establish this asymmetry?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of BMP signaling in LR axis establishment in sea urchin embryos using a combination of molecular and genetic approaches, including gene expression analysis, perturbation of BMP activities, and examination of the effects of BMP signaling on Nodal expression.

    **Main Findings:** We found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, and is required for the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures. In contrast, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. Our results suggest that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in sea urchins and suggest that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes. Our results also highlight the importance of BMP signaling in regulating the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that BMP signaling plays a crucial role in establishing LR asymmetry in sea urchin embryos, and that Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling to control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LR asymmetry in deuterostomes and suggest that BMP signaling is a key regulator of left-sided development in sea urchins.

    **Title:** Checkpoint-Dependent Signaling Pathways Regulate Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Immediate Early Gene Expression during the Cell Cycle

    **Research Question:** How do checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways control human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early (IE) gene expression during the cell cycle, and what is the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in this process?

    **Methods:** We investigated the regulation of HCMV IE gene expression during the cell cycle using a combination of genotoxic stress, chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, and pharmacological inhibition of CDKs.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the block to IE gene expression during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle can be overcome by both genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, indicating the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways in controlling IE gene repression. We found that p53, a tumor suppressor protein, is required for checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression, and that the CDK inhibitor p21 is downstream of p53. Furthermore, treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53. Importantly, CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 (NT2) cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that a timely block to CDK activity not only secures phase specificity of the HCMV IE gene expression program but also plays a hitherto unrecognized role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state. The data indicate that checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways, particularly those involving p53 and CDKs, are crucial for controlling HCMV IE gene expression during the cell cycle.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of HCMV IE gene expression during the cell cycle and highlights the importance of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways in controlling viral gene expression. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of HCMV latency and reactivation, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCMV infections.

    **Title:** Cell-Intrinsic Type I Interferon Secretion in Dendritic Cells Facilitates HIV-1-Specific CD8 T Cell Responses in Elite Controllers

    **Background:** HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) restrict HIV-1 replication through highly functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses, but the mechanisms supporting the evolution of effective HIV-1-specific T cell immunity in these patients remain undefined. Cytosolic immune recognition of HIV-1 in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) can facilitate priming and expansion of HIV-1-specific T cells, but HIV-1 seems to avoid intracellular immune recognition in cDCs in most infected individuals.

    **Research Question:** Do cell-intrinsic immune responses in cDCs from EC contribute to the generation of potent antiviral T cell immune responses against HIV-1?

    **Methods:** We conducted a detailed analysis of cell-intrinsic immune responses to HIV-1 in primary cDCs from EC, a small subgroup of patients who control HIV-1 replication in the absence of treatment.

    **Main Findings:** Exposure of cDCs from EC to HIV-1 led to a rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of several interferon-stimulated effector genes. Emergence of these cell-intrinsic immune responses was associated with a reduced induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75, and an accumulation of viral reverse transcripts. Pharmacological blockade of viral reverse transcription or siRNA-mediated silencing of the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS inhibited these cell-intrinsic immune responses.

    **Implications:** Improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in cDCs from EC translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our data suggest an important role of cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells for the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells. These findings may be helpful for eliciting functional T cell immunity against HIV-1 for preventative or therapeutic clinical purposes. Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate the induction of effective HIV-1-specific T cells by dendritic cells is of critical interest for developing improved immunologic approaches for HIV-1 treatment and prevention.
Title: Identification of Sir2 as a Negative Regulator of Fat Storage in Drosophila Larvae Using a Buoyancy-Based Screening Method

    Abstract:
    Obesity is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with few genes known to predispose individuals to this condition. Genetic screens in invertebrates, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have the potential to identify genes and pathways regulating fat storage, which are likely to be conserved in humans. We developed a simple buoyancy-based screening method to identify mutant Drosophila larvae with increased levels of stored fat. Using this approach, we identified 66 genes that, when mutated, increase organismal fat levels, including a sirtuin family member, Sir2. We demonstrate that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner and regulates the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key regulatory proteins. Notably, Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild-type larvae under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided, suggesting a Sir2-mediated pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation. Our findings implicate Sir2 as a key regulator in the switch from utilizing ingested nutrients to stored fat as an energy source and highlight the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for studying the genetic basis of obesity.

    **Title:** Evolutionary Robustness of Asymmetric Cell Division in Nematodes: A Comparative Study of Spindle Positioning in 42 Species

    **Research Question:** How has the process of asymmetric cell division evolved in nematodes, and what are the underlying mechanisms of spindle positioning that dictate the size and fate of daughter cells?

    **Methods:** We recorded the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, including 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species, using time-lapse DIC videomicroscopy. Our dataset comprises 128 strains, providing a comprehensive collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of asymmetric spindle positioning.

    **Main Findings:** Although all species underwent an asymmetric first cell division, we observed large intra- and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed frequently during evolution, with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently, contrasting with expectations based on Caenorhabditis elegans studies.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that, while the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over the course of nematode evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways. This suggests that asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift, like other developmental processes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary robustness of asymmetric cell division in nematodes, revealing previously unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the biophysical and molecular basis of asymmetric cell division and highlight the importance of comparative studies in unraveling the evolution of developmental processes.

    **Title:** Differential Regulation of the OmpR Regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli in Response to Acid Stress

    **Research Question:** How do Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli regulate their OmpR regulons in response to acid stress, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences?

    **Methods:** We compared the expression of the OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium and E. coli at different pH values using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We also engineered E. coli strains to express the S. Typhimurium OmpR regulon and examined their response to acid stress.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that OmpR expression is regulated differently in S. Typhimurium and E. coli in response to acid stress. In S. Typhimurium, OmpR expression is elevated at low pH, leading to enhanced binding to its targets throughout the genome. In contrast, E. coli OmpR expression is not induced by acid stress. We found that the S. Typhimurium OmpR regulon includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes, that are not present in E. coli. We also identified a unique acid-inducible promoter and transcription start site (TSS-1) in the S. Typhimurium ompB operon that is not present in E. coli.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the differential regulation of the OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium and E. coli is a key factor in their ability to adapt to different environments and exploit new niches, including pathogenic interactions with host organisms. The ability of S. Typhimurium to regulate its OmpR regulon in response to acid stress may be a key factor in its virulence.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential regulation of the OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. We propose that the ability of OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon arises from its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets, allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of new gene networks and the adaptation of bacteria to different environments.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the SET domain-containing protein, NUE, secreted by Chlamydia trachomatis during infection, and how does it interact with host cell chromatin?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemical assays to identify and characterize NUE, a novel effector protein secreted by Chlamydia trachomatis. We analyzed the genome sequence of C. trachomatis and identified a SET domain-containing protein, which we named NUE. We demonstrated that NUE is secreted via a type III secretion mechanism and translocates to the host cell nucleus, where it associates with chromatin.

    **Main Findings:** We showed that NUE is a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself (automethylation). In vitro methylation assays confirmed the enzymatic activity of NUE, and mutants deficient in automethylation demonstrated diminished activity towards histones, suggesting that automethylation enhances enzymatic activity. We also found that NUE has a preference for mammalian histones over chlamydial Hc1.

    **Implications:** This study is the first description of a bacterial effector that directly targets mammalian histones. Our findings suggest that NUE plays a crucial role in the pathogenicity of Chlamydia trachomatis by modifying host cell chromatin. The identification of NUE as a histone methyltransferase provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Chlamydia infection.

    **Conclusions:** We propose to designate CT737 and its homologs in other chlamydiae genomes as NUE, as it is the first nuclear effector identified in chlamydiae. Further studies are needed to elucidate the identity of the genes regulated by NUE translocation in the nucleus during Chlamydia infection. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of Chlamydia pathogenicity and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Chlamydia infections.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Recessive Effects on Human Height: Evidence for Inbreeding Depression

    **Research Question:** Do genome-wide recessive genetic effects contribute to the heritability of human height, and if so, what is the magnitude of this effect?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of over 35,000 individuals from 21 different population samples to investigate the relationship between genome-wide homozygosity and adult height. We used three alternative estimates of genomic homozygosity to capture different aspects of this phenomenon.

    **Main Findings:** We found a highly significant inverse association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared to the offspring of unrelated individuals. This effect remained significant after controlling for socio-economic status (SES), a potential confounder. However, we observed significant heterogeneity among populations, with varying effect sizes and directions of the association.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that multiple, rare, recessive variants contribute to human height, providing evidence for a polygenic recessive component in the genetic architecture of height. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits and highlights the potential for inbreeding depression to influence human height.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first evidence for genome-wide recessive effects on human height, demonstrating that inbreeding depression is a significant contributor to the heritability of this complex trait. Our results pave the way for further investigation into the genetic architecture of other heritable quantitative traits (QTs) of biomedical importance. The methodology developed in this study is generally applicable to QTs, allowing for the exploration of inbreeding effects on a range of traits.

    **Title:** Distinct Monocyte Subpopulations Induced During Malaria Infection Exhibit Anti-Parasitic Activity

    **Research Question:** Do discrete monocyte (MO) subpopulations exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions during malaria infection, and are they associated with anti-parasitic activity?

    **Methods:** We characterized the phenotype and function of blood MO from healthy malaria-exposed individuals and patients with acute uncomplicated malaria using flow cytometry and an in vitro antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) assay.

    **Main Findings:** We identified two distinct MO subpopulations in patients with acute uncomplicated malaria, characterized by high expression of CD16, CCR2, and CX3CR1 on the CD14high (hi) MO subset. These subpopulations differed significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth through the ADCI mechanism. Patients with high percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hi CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO and high mean levels of ADCI activity had lower blood parasitemias compared to those with low numbers of these MO subpopulations.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that discrete MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity. The expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on the CD14hi MO subset defines two subgroups of patients that differ significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the complex relationships between the phenotype and functional activity of blood MO from patients and healthy malaria-exposed individuals. The identification of distinct MO subpopulations with anti-parasitic activity has important implications for our understanding of the immune response to malaria and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these MO subpopulations.

    **Key Findings:**

    * Two distinct MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection, characterized by high expression of CD16, CCR2, and CX3CR1 on the CD14hi MO subset.
    * These subpopulations differ significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth through the ADCI mechanism.
    * Patients with high percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hi CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO and high mean levels of ADCI activity have lower blood parasitemias compared to those with low numbers of these MO subpopulations.
    * The expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on the CD14hi MO subset defines two subgroups of patients that differ significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth.

    Title: Systemic Immune Alterations in Response to Schistosoma mansoni Infection Do Not Increase HIV Susceptibility in the Foreskin

    Research Question: Does Schistosoma mansoni infection increase the frequency of highly HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets in the blood and foreskin of HIV-uninfected Ugandan men?

    Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 34 HIV- and malaria-uninfected Ugandan men who underwent elective circumcision. Tissue and blood samples were obtained from 12 men definitively positive for S. mansoni eggs in stool and 12 definitively negative for both S. mansoni eggs and worm antigen. T cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

    Main Findings: S. mansoni-infected men had a higher frequency of systemic Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in the blood compared to uninfected men (22.9% vs. 16.5%, p < 0.05; 2.3% vs. 1.5%, p < 0.05; and 0.5% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.01, respectively). Additionally, Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function, producing multiple cytokines (28.1% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.046). However, these immune alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue.

    Implications: These findings suggest that S. mansoni infection is associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible T cell subsets in the blood, but not in the foreskin. The systemic immune impact of S. mansoni infection does not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual Ugandan men.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that S. mansoni infection does not increase HIV susceptibility in the foreskin, despite inducing immune alterations in the blood. These findings have important implications for understanding the relationship between S. mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility. Further research is needed to determine whether these systemic immune changes would alter HIV susceptibility, given that they are limited to the blood compartment.

    **Title:** Wolbachia Depletion Induces Non-Cell Autonomous Apoptosis in Filarial Nematodes: Implications for Filarial Disease Treatment

    **Research Question:** What are the cellular mechanisms underlying the mutualistic relationship between Wolbachia and filarial nematodes, and how does depletion of Wolbachia affect nematode development, fertility, and viability?

    **Methods:** We employed whole mount confocal microscopy to investigate the effects of Wolbachia depletion on adult germline cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae (L4) in B. malayi and O. volvulus.

    **Main Findings:** Depletion of Wolbachia using tetracycline resulted in extensive apoptosis in adult germline cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and L4 larvae. Notably, apoptosis occurred in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected prior to antibiotic treatment, suggesting a non-cell autonomous effect. In contrast, the hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of Wolbachia, showed no apoptosis, but disruption of the hypodermal cytoskeleton occurred following Wolbachia depletion.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occur prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes. The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following depletion of Wolbachia, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization, which are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms.

    **Conclusions:** Our observations demonstrate that Wolbachia depletion induces non-cell autonomous apoptosis in filarial nematodes, suggesting that factors originating from Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords play a crucial role in maintaining nematode development, fertility, and viability. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel approaches to treating filarial diseases, highlighting the potential of Wolbachia depletion as a therapeutic strategy to reduce microfilarial loads and interrupt transmission.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Antiplasmodial Pantothenate Analogues in Plasmodium falciparum

    Abstract:
    The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum relies on extracellular pantothenate for proliferation, which is converted into coenzyme A (CoA) via a five-enzyme pathway, including pantothenate kinase (PfPanK). Antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, such as pantothenol and CJ-15,801, target CoA biosynthesis/utilization, but their exact mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanism of action of these analogues by generating resistant parasite lines through continuous drug-pressuring with pantothenol or CJ-15,801. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PanK genes, Pfpank1, in all resistant lines. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for a functional PanK essential for normal growth. Our results provide evidence for different pantothenate analogue classes having distinct mechanisms of action, with some inhibiting CoA biosynthesis and others inhibiting CoA-utilizing enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Pfpank1 mutations can influence the sensitivity profile of parasites to different pantothenate analogue classes. Our study provides genetic evidence validating the importance of the metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in the antiplasmodial activity of these compounds.

    Research Question: What is the mechanism of action of antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, such as pantothenol and CJ-15,801, in Plasmodium falciparum?

    Methods: We generated resistant parasite lines through continuous drug-pressuring with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 and performed whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations in putative PanK genes.

    Main Findings: Mutations in Pfpank1 were identified in all resistant lines, which significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost. The mutation at position 507 of PfPanK1 in PanOH-A makes the parasite resistant to certain pantothenate analogues while hypersensitizing it to pantothenate analogues of a different class.

    Implications: Our study provides evidence for different pantothenate analogue classes having distinct mechanisms of action, targeting CoA biosynthesis or utilization. Pfpank1 mutations can influence the sensitivity profile of parasites to different pantothenate analogue classes.

    Conclusions: Our study elucidates the mechanism of action of antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues and provides genetic evidence validating the importance of the metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in the antiplasmodial activity of these compounds.

    Title: Genome-Wide Association Studies Identify Genetic Variants Associated with PR Interval Duration in African Americans

    Background: The PR interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time and is a heritable trait that provides important information about arrhythmia risk. Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified common genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, but there is a paucity of GWA studies in individuals of African ancestry.

    Methods: We performed GWA studies in African American individuals from four cohorts (n=6,247) to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray, and imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels.

    Main Findings: We observed a strong signal (rs3922844) within the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) with genome-wide significant association (p<2.5×10−8) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans (beta=5.1 msec per minor allele, 95% CI=4.1–6.1, p=3×10−23). This SNP was also associated with PR interval (beta=2.4 msec per minor allele, 95% CI=1.8–3.0, p=3×10−16) in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size (p for heterogeneity <0.001) and variability explained (0.5%).

    Implications: Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.

    Conclusions: The identification of genetic variants associated with PR interval duration in African Americans provides novel insights into molecular electrophysiology and may lead to novel drug targets for arrhythmia treatment and genetic prediction of arrhythmia risk and response to antiarrhythmics. Further exploration of the clinical impact of these findings is warranted.

    Title: Identification of ARL8 as a Novel Component of Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) RNA Replication Complexes

    Background: Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a positive-strand RNA virus, replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes. Previous studies have shown that a host seven-pass transmembrane protein, TOM1, is essential for efficient ToMV multiplication. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ToMV replication remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What are the roles of ARL8, a small GTP-binding protein, and TOM1 in ToMV RNA replication complexes?

    Methods: We used a combination of co-purification, immunoprecipitation, and in vitro translation-replication assays to investigate the interactions between ToMV replication proteins, TOM1, and ARL8.

    Main Findings: We found that ARL8 co-purifies with ToMV 180K replication protein and TOM1 from solubilized membranes of ToMV-infected tobacco cells. Furthermore, simultaneous mutations in two specific ARL8 genes completely inhibited ToMV multiplication in Arabidopsis thaliana. In an in vitro ToMV RNA translation-replication system, the lack of either TOM1 or ARL8 proteins inhibited the production of replicative-form RNA. We also detected RNA 5′-capping activity in the membrane fraction when ToMV 130K protein was co-expressed with TOM1 and ARL8 in yeast.

    Implications: Our results suggest that ARL8 is a novel component of ToMV RNA replication complexes and plays a crucial role in the activation of replication proteins' RNA synthesizing and capping functions. The formation of a complex containing ToMV replication proteins, TOM1, and ARL8 is essential for efficient ToMV multiplication.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ToMV replication and highlights the importance of ARL8 in the replication process. The identification of ARL8 as a novel component of ToMV RNA replication complexes has significant implications for the development of novel antiviral strategies against ToMV and other eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses.

    **Title:** Comparative Analysis of Feed-Forward and Feedback Inhibition in the Locust Olfactory System

    **Research Question:** How do feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibitory motifs shape the firing patterns of Kenyon cells (KCs) in the locust olfactory system, and what are the implications for olfactory learning and memory?

    **Methods:** We developed two computational models of the locust olfactory system, one implementing FF inhibition and the other FB inhibition, to investigate the effects of these inhibitory motifs on KC responses to odor stimuli.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that both FF and FB inhibition can maintain sparse KC responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition can create a phase response consistent with in vivo data, suggesting that FB inhibition may be the primary source of inhibition to KCs. Furthermore, we found that GGN-mediated inhibition affects both KCs and lateral horn interneurons (LHNs), although both classes of neurons respond differently to odor presentations.

    **Implications:** These findings provide general rules for the effects of FF versus FB inhibition in circuit dynamics and suggest that GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to KCs. A better understanding of how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.

    **Conclusions:** Our study clarifies the properties of FF and FB inhibition in the locust olfactory system and highlights the importance of FB inhibition in creating a phase response consistent with in vivo data. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory learning and memory, and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders related to olfactory processing.

    **Supporting Text:** Previous studies have suggested that FF inhibition mediated by a population of inhibitory cells in the locust lateral horn (LH) provides the necessary inhibitory input to KCs of the mushroom body. However, recent evidence suggests that a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and that inhibition from this cell is mediated by a FB loop including KCs and the GGN. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of FF and FB inhibition in the locust olfactory system, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory processing and learning.
Title: Development of a Dual Combined Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) Assay for Pan-Lyssavirus Detection in Humans and Animals

    Abstract:
    The definitive diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies, relies heavily on laboratory confirmation. Traditional post-mortem diagnosis methods, such as direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation, have been supplemented by molecular techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. However, these techniques face challenges in achieving high specificity and sensitivity while accounting for the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses. To address this issue, we developed a dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (combo RT-qPCR) method for pan-lyssavirus detection. This assay combines two complementary technologies: a probe-based (TaqMan) RT-qPCR for detecting the RABV species (pan-RABV RT-qPCR) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green) to detect other lyssavirus species (pan-lyssa RT-qPCR). We evaluated the performance of this combined assay using a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all genetic variability encountered at the viral species level and extended to almost all lyssavirus species characterized to date. The method was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples, including saliva, skin, and brain biopsies. Our results show that the combo RT-qPCR method detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and interest of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. Furthermore, this method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This combined RT-qPCR method constitutes a relevant, useful, and validated tool for the diagnosis of rabies in both humans and animals, representing a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance.
Title: Efficacy of Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Fences in Controlling Tsetse Fly Populations and Reducing Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana

Abstract:

Background: Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis has resulted in significant losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana, with over 50% losses reported in 2007. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse fly populations and reducing the risk of trypanosomiasis in domestic pigs.

Methods: A control trial was conducted from May 4th to October 10th, 2007, in two villages in the Eastern Region of Ghana. One village served as a control, with 14 pigsties, while the other village had 24 pigsties protected with insecticide-treated mosquito fences. Tsetse fly densities were monitored bi-monthly using geo-referenced bi-conical traps, and 50 pigs from each village were ear-tagged and treated with a curative dose of diminazene aceturate.

Results: The results showed a significant reduction of over 90% in tsetse fly populations in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, tsetse fly populations in the control village remained unaffected, displaying only seasonal variations. The trypanosome prevalence in protected pigs decreased from 76% to 16% within three months, while it remained high (84%) in control pigs. After six months, 8% of protected pigs were infected, compared to 60% in the control group.

Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse fly populations and reducing the risk of trypanosomiasis in domestic pigs. The significant reduction in tsetse fly numbers and trypanosome prevalence in protected pigs highlights the potential of this intervention to improve livestock health and productivity in areas where tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis is a significant threat. The results also suggest that the use of insecticide-treated mosquito fences can provide a viable option for maintaining livestock and generating income in areas previously deemed unsuitable due to the risk of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis.
Title: Assessing Reproducibility and Transparency in Biomedical Research: A 15-Year Analysis of Published Journal Articles

    Abstract:
    The reproducibility and transparency of biomedical research have become pressing concerns in the scientific community. This study aimed to evaluate the current status of reproducibility and transparency in a random sample of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014. We assessed indicators such as public access to raw data and protocols, replication studies, systematic integration of evidence, and documentation of funding and potential conflicts of interest. Our results show that only one study provided a full protocol, and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n = 4), and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. Furthermore, the majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. However, we observed a significant decrease in the percentage of articles with no statement of conflict (94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014) and an increase in the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts (0% in 2000, 15.4% in 2014) or no conflicts (5.6% in 2000, 50.0% in 2014). Notably, articles published in clinical medicine journals were almost twice as likely to not include any information on funding and to have private funding compared to other fields. Our study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the scientific literature. These findings highlight the need for increased transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research, particularly in clinical medicine journals.

    **Title:** Identification of Host Cells Targeted by Yersinia pestis during Primary Pneumonic Plague

    **Research Question:** What are the primary host cells targeted by Yersinia pestis during the pre-inflammatory phase of primary pneumonic plague, and how do these interactions influence the progression of disease?

    **Methods:** We employed a FRET-based probe to quantify the injection of effector proteins by the Y. pestis type III secretion system (T3SS) in mice infected with fully virulent Y. pestis. We also used a YopE-TEM β-lactamase hybrid protein to identify the host cells targeted in the lung and evaluate the effect of depletion of these cell types on the progression of pneumonic plague.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Y. pestis targets alveolar macrophages early during infection, followed by a switch in host cell preference to neutrophils. Depletion of approximately 92% of alveolar macrophages had little or no effect on bacterial burden in the lung, indicating that macrophages are not involved in limiting Yersinia survival in the lung. In contrast, neutrophil influx was unable to limit bacterial growth in the lung and was ultimately responsible for the severe inflammation during the lethal pro-inflammatory phase.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Y. pestis creates a localized protective environment in the lungs early during pneumonic plague by deactivating host innate immune responses. The ability of Y. pestis to target neutrophils, rather than macrophages, may be a key factor in the progression of disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study is the first to identify the primary host cells targeted by Y. pestis during primary pneumonic plague and to evaluate population dynamics in the lung during disease progression. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of Y. pestis pathogenesis and highlight the importance of neutrophils in the development of severe inflammation during pneumonic plague. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this highly lethal disease.
Title: Evaluation of Serological Tests for Diagnosing Asymptomatic Visceral Leishmaniasis Infections in a Cohort Study in Southeast Brazil

    Abstract:
    Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant public health concern, particularly in Brazil, where it is caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. Diagnosing asymptomatic carriers is a major challenge in VL population studies. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of serological tests in identifying asymptomatic VL infections in a cohort with a two-year follow-up period in an urban area in Southeast Brazil.

    Methods: Blood samples were collected from 136 cohort participants (97 positive and 39 negative by PCR/hybridization in 1999) and 30 controls (22 healthy individuals and 8 patients with kala-azar). Two molecular biology techniques (reference tests) were performed: PCR with Leishmania-generic primer followed by hybridization using L. infantum probe, and PCR with specific primer to L. donovani complex. Plasma samples were tested by ELISA using three different antigens: L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. The accuracy of the serological tests was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, and ROC curve.

    Main Findings: The presence of Leishmania was confirmed by molecular techniques in all kala-azar patients and 117 (86%) of the cohort participants. Kala-azar patients showed high reactivity in ELISAs, whereas asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against the antigens tested. The L. amazonensis and L. infantum antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41.0%, respectively) than rK39 (26.5%), but the specificity of rK39 was higher (73.7%) than L. amazonensis (52.6%) and L. infantum antigens (36.8%). There was low agreement among the different antigens used (kappa < 0.10).

    Implications: Serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which could lead to misclassification bias in population studies. This may compromise the results of studies that have used serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection.

    Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the limitations of serological tests in diagnosing asymptomatic VL infections. Molecular techniques remain the gold standard for diagnosing VL, and serological tests should be used with caution in population studies. Further research is needed to develop more accurate diagnostic tools for asymptomatic VL infections.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Analysis of Retrotransposon Silencing in Mammalian Cells Reveals Complex Interplay between Silencing Mechanisms

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms of retrotransposon silencing in mammalian cells, and how do different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon respond to these silencing mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed a computational approach to analyze Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression microarray data to identify retrotransposon expression in mouse embryonic stem cells. We used repeat-annotation of microarray data to investigate the targets of established silencing mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and polycomb repressive complexes.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells, and that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms. We identified the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a component of the retrotransposon silencing machinery in mouse embryonic stem cells and determined the retrotransposon targets of Hdac1 in these cells. We also identified retrotransposons that are targets of other silencing mechanisms, including DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between silencing mechanisms that repress retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells. The identification of Hdac1 as a regulator of retrotransposons in mouse ES cells highlights the importance of histone deacetylation in retrotransposon silencing. Our findings also suggest that repeat annotation of gene expression microarray data can be used to monitor genome-wide silencing of repetitive elements and identify new targets of silencing mechanisms.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of computational analysis of microarray data to investigate retrotransposon silencing in mammalian cells. Our results provide new insights into the complex mechanisms of retrotransposon silencing and highlight the importance of histone deacetylation in regulating retrotransposon expression. The application of this approach to gene expression microarray data is likely to generate new insights into retrotransposon regulation in mammals and help identify further components of the defence mechanisms that protect the mammalian genome from retrotransposition.

    **Title:** Arabidopsis thaliana Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) Mediates Light Control of Flowering Time through CRY2-Interacting bHLH Proteins (CIBs)

    **Research Question:** How do CRY2-interacting bHLH proteins (CIBs) regulate flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to blue light?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including transient Arabidopsis transcription assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and genetic analysis, to investigate the role of CIBs in regulating flowering time in response to blue light.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CIB1 specifically interacts with CRY2 in response to blue light to activate the transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a key regulator of flowering time. We also found that CIB1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter, which contains non-canonical E-box sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CIB1 and other CIB proteins (CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5) act redundantly to activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. Notably, we show that CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, which have a higher binding affinity to non-canonical E-box DNA sequences than homodimers.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying light control of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that CIBs play a crucial role in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering and that different CIB proteins can form heterodimers to interact with non-canonical E-box DNA sequences in vivo. Our findings also suggest that the expression of CIB proteins is regulated specifically by blue light, consistent with the hypothesis that different CIB proteins play similar roles in the CRY2-mediated blue light signaling pathway.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that CIBs function redundantly in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering and that different CIBs form heterodimers to interact with non-canonical E-box DNA sequences in vivo. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying light control of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana and highlight the importance of CIBs in regulating flowering time in response to blue light.

    Title: Cost-Effectiveness of Overseas Presumptive Treatment vs. Domestic Screening and Treatment for Intestinal Parasites in U.S.-Bound Refugees

    Background: Intestinal parasites (hookworm, Trichuris trichuria, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis) are rare in the United States but may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in refugees from endemic countries, leading to potentially serious consequences.

    Research Question: What is the cost-effectiveness of overseas presumptive treatment vs. domestic screening and treatment for intestinal parasites in U.S.-bound refugees?

    Methods: An economic decision tree model terminating in Markov processes was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 U.S.-bound Asian refugees: 1) "No Program," 2) U.S. "Domestic Screening and Treatment," 3) "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" presumptive treatment, and 4) "Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides." Markov transition state models were used to estimate long-term effects of parasitic infections. Health outcome measures included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

    Main Findings: The "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" option was the most effective treatment option, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted, or $2,219/$24,036 per QALY/life year gained relative to "No Program." Overseas presumptive treatment for U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs.

    Implications: The findings suggest that overseas presumptive treatment for intestinal parasites in U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective strategy that can reduce the burden of disease and improve health outcomes. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduces the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare, but potentially fatal, disseminated strongyloidiasis.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that overseas presumptive treatment for intestinal parasites in U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective alternative to domestic screening and treatment programs. The findings have important implications for public health policy and practice, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to prevent and control intestinal parasitic infections in refugee populations.

    **Title:** Nematocida displodere: A Novel Microsporidian Pathogen Exhibiting Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What is the tissue tropism of Nematocida displodere, a newly discovered microsporidian parasite of Caenorhabditis elegans, and how does it differ from other Nematocida species?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of whole-genome sequencing, phylogenomic analysis, and live imaging to characterize the life cycle of Nematocida displodere in Caenorhabditis elegans. We also compared the genome of N. displodere with those of two closely related species, Nematocida parisii and Nematocida sp. 1.

    **Main Findings:** Nematocida displodere exhibits a unique tissue tropism, infecting and replicating in multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. In contrast to N. parisii and Nematocida sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine, N. displodere shows robust invasion of the intestine but minimal replication. Our genome analysis revealed that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus, with over 10% of its proteins belonging to a species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function.

    **Implications:** The discovery of Nematocida displodere provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate the factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches. Our findings suggest that the unique tissue tropism of N. displodere may be mediated by its species-specific RING-domain containing proteins.

    **Conclusions:** Nematocida displodere is a novel microsporidian pathogen that exhibits a broad tissue tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans, distinguishing it from other Nematocida species. Our study highlights the importance of understanding host-microbe interactions and provides a valuable model system for investigating the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of pathogen tissue tropism.

    **Title:** Chromatin Remodeling by the Cockayne Syndrome Complementation Group B (CSB) Protein is Essential for Transcription-Coupled DNA Repair

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the Cockayne Syndrome Complementation Group B (CSB) protein in chromatin remodeling and transcription-coupled DNA repair, and how does it interact with NAP1-like histone chaperones?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the chromatin remodeling activity of CSB and its interaction with NAP1-like histone chaperones.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and that this activity is greatly enhanced by NAP1-like histone chaperones. We identified NAP1-like histone chaperones as new CSB-binding partners and demonstrated that chromatin remodeling by the combined activities of CSB and NAP1-like chaperones is required for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. Furthermore, we found that chromatin remodeling and repair protein recruitment mediated by CSB are separable activities.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the functions of chromatin remodeling by CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair and sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome. The collaboration between CSB and NAP1-like histone chaperones adds a new dimension to our understanding of the ways in which ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones regulate chromatin structure.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that CSB has two separable functions in transcription-coupled DNA repair: one function is protein factor recruitment, which is independent of nucleosome remodeling, and the other function is chromatin remodeling, which requires the combined activities of CSB and NAP1-like histone chaperones. The identification of NAP1-like histone chaperones as CSB-binding partners and their role in enhancing CSB-mediated chromatin remodeling provides new avenues for understanding the mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome and transcription-coupled DNA repair. Further studies are needed to determine whether CSB and NAP1-like histone chaperones cooperate in nucleosome assembly/disassembly during normal transcription and transcription-coupled DNA repair.

    **Title:** Mapping Epigenetic Variation in the Human Genome: Unveiling the Complex Interplay between Genetic and Environmental Factors

    **Research Question:** What is the nature and extent of epigenetic variation in the human genome, and how do genetic and environmental factors contribute to this variation?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation patterns in five purified human cell types, identifying hundreds of genomic loci with high inter-individual epigenetic variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs). We used a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to investigate the characteristics and functional implications of VMRs.

    **Main Findings:** We found that VMRs occur preferentially at enhancers and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs), and that the majority of VMRs have high heritability. However, a subset of VMRs shows highly correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks that have low heritability, differ between cell types, and are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, we defined a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs enriched for genes involved in T-cell activation, while in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-regulated VMRs comprising all four HOX gene clusters was enriched for control of tissue growth.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a detailed map of common epigenetic variation in the human genome, revealing that both genetic and environmental factors underlie this variation. We experimentally demonstrated that some VMR networks are responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels at these loci changing in a coordinated fashion in trans dependent on cellular growth. Notably, environmentally-responsive VMRs showed a strong enrichment for imprinted loci, suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping epigenetic variation in the human genome. The identification of VMRs and their co-regulated networks provides new insights into the biology of variable methylation across the human genome, with implications for our understanding of gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and disease susceptibility.

    **Title:** Evaluation of the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid Test for Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) and Its Combination with IgM/IgG Rapid Test for Acute Dengue Diagnosis

    **Research Question:** Can the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for NS1 improve the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis when used in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test?

    **Methods:** A retrospective study was conducted in Vietnam and Malaysia to evaluate the performance of the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for NS1 and its combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test. A total of 198 acute laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples from Vietnam and 263 laboratory-confirmed positive and 30 negative samples from Malaysia were tested.

    **Main Findings:** The sensitivity and specificity of the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for NS1 were 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8% to 75.6%) and 96% (95% CI: 92.2% to 99.8%) in Vietnam, and 68.9% (95% CI: 61.8% to 76.1%) and 96.7% (95% CI: 82.8% to 99.9%) in Malaysia, respectively. When used in combination with the IgM/IgG rapid test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0%. The combination of NS1 testing with IgM and IgG detection resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity compared to using each individual marker.

    **Implications:** This study highlights the potential of using dengue NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology to increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extend the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples.

    **Conclusions:** The Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for NS1 is a sensitive and specific rapid test for dengue NS1. When used in combination with an IgM/IgG rapid test, a significant increase in sensitivity for acute dengue was observed, with the added benefit of an extended window of detection. The combination of NS1 testing with IgM and IgG detection resulted in optimal diagnostic sensitivity for acute dengue, with a significant increase in sensitivity compared to using each individual marker.

    **Title:** Predicting Functional RNA Structures in Vivo: A Comparative Approach with Transat

    **Research Question:** How do evolutionarily related RNA genes fold in vivo, and can we develop a computational method to predict their structural features?

    **Methods:** We developed a new computational method, Transat, which detects conserved helices of high statistical significance in RNA sequences. We evaluated the performance of Transat on a comprehensive dataset of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted and alternative structural configurations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Transat accurately predicts the structural features of known reference structures and identifies unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules. Moreover, Transat provides evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways, supporting the notion that homologous RNA sequences not only assume similar reference RNA structures but also fold similarly. Notably, the structural features predicted by Transat differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of comparative approaches in predicting RNA folding pathways in vivo. Unlike existing methods, Transat works in a comparative way, which has the advantage of highlighting conserved features and not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment. However, this approach has the disadvantage of not being able to predict features as a function of time.

    **Conclusions:** The development of Transat represents a significant step forward in predicting functional RNA structures in vivo. Our method has the potential to enable more comprehensive and systematic studies of RNA folding pathways and alternative structural configurations. The predictions made by Transat will provide useful input to the design and interpretation of future experiments, ultimately contributing to our understanding of how RNA sequences fold in vivo. Furthermore, our study underscores the importance of considering the co-transcriptional folding pathway, which can differ significantly from the re-folding pathway in terms of time line and structural features.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Plant Immunity: A Systems-Level Analysis of the Arabidopsis Immune Network

    **Research Question:** How does the Arabidopsis plant immune network respond to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 (flg22) and what are the regulatory mechanisms underlying this response?

    **Methods:** We employed a network reconstitution strategy to dissect the Arabidopsis immune network that mediates Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI). By disassembling and reassembling the network stepwise, we resolved systems-level regulatory mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis transcriptome response to flg22.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed widespread interactions among major sub-networks (sectors) in the flg22-responsive transcriptome, including the jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4), and salicylate (SA) signaling sectors. These interactions resulted in network buffering, which allowed the network to compensate for loss of function in individual components. We demonstrated that many of these regulatory mechanisms were not detectable by traditional genetic approaches, such as single-gene null-mutant analysis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the Arabidopsis immune network is highly resilient against perturbations, including those caused by pathogen effectors that target and disable plant immune signaling proteins. This buffering capacity conceals the identity of network components, making it challenging to identify key players in plant immunity using traditional genetic approaches.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a systems biology approach, network reconstitution, in elucidating the dynamical component functions of the plant immune signaling network. We show that high-order perturbation at the scale of signaling sectors and dynamic transcriptional profiling can help decipher the regulation of complex networks, such as the plant immune signaling network. Our results highlight the importance of network buffering in plant immunity and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis immune response to flg22.

    **Title:** Genetic Mechanisms of Neuroepithelial Patterning in the Drosophila Embryonic Optic Placode

    **Research Question:** How do genetic networks regulate the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as primary and secondary photoreceptor (PR) precursors, in the Drosophila embryonic optic placode?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology techniques to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying neuroepithelial patterning in the Drosophila embryonic optic placode. We analyzed the expression patterns of key transcription factors, including Atonal (Ato) and Tailless (Tll), and signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch, to elucidate their roles in specifying larval eye and optic lobe precursors.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Ato specifies larval eye precursors, while Tll is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hh and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. Notably, the correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. Furthermore, Notch signaling controls a binary cell fate decision, acting at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms of neuroepithelial patterning in the Drosophila embryonic optic placode. The combinatorial action of cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic factors, including Ato, Tll, Hh, and Notch signaling, ensures the precise specification of larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as primary and secondary PR precursors. These findings have implications for our understanding of neural tissue patterning and the development of the compound eye in Drosophila.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive model of how genetic networks regulate the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as primary and secondary PR precursors, in the Drosophila embryonic optic placode. These findings highlight the importance of combinatorial action of cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic factors in controlling neural tissue patterning and provide a framework for understanding the development of the compound eye in Drosophila.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Redox-Dependent Mechanism of Human ß-Defensin 1 (hBD1) in Antimicrobial Defense

    **Research Question:** How does human ß-defensin 1 (hBD1) exhibit distinct antimicrobial activities between its oxidized and reduced forms, and what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We employed electron microscopy, transmigration assays, and biochemical analyses to investigate the antimicrobial mechanisms of hBD1 in its reduced (hBD1red) and oxidized (hBD1ox) forms.

    **Main Findings:** Electron microscopy revealed a previously unknown net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with hBD1red, but not hBD1ox. A transmigration assay demonstrated that hBD1-derived nets capture bacteria and inhibit bacterial transmigration independently of bacterial killing. The presence of nets completely prevented migration of hBD1-resistant pathogens and remained stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with high protease activity. In contrast to HD6, cysteins were necessary for net formation by hBD1.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a redox-dependent function of hBD1, where the reduced form provides additional host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures, preventing bacterial invasion. This mechanism differs from net formation by other defensins, such as Paneth cell-derived human α-defensin 6 (HD6).

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the multifunctional activities of hBD1, providing distinct and complementary killing-based and killing-independent antimicrobial mechanisms. The redox-dependent function of hBD1 serves as an additional mechanism of action, underscoring the importance of understanding the modes of action of endogenous host peptides in shaping the microbiota. These findings have implications for the development of new antimicrobial strategies that exploit the unique properties of human host defense peptides.

    **Title:** OCRL1 Deficiency Impairs Endocytosis in the Zebrafish Pronephric Tubule: Implications for Lowe Syndrome and Dent-2 Disease

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying basis for the renal tubulopathy seen in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, which are caused by mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL1?

    **Methods:** We used a zebrafish model to investigate the role of OCRL1 in endocytosis within the pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule. We generated OCRL1-deficient zebrafish embryos and analyzed their endocytic trafficking using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that OCRL1 deficiency impairs endocytosis in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, characterized by reduced apical uptake of fluid phase markers and low molecular weight proteins from the glomerular filtrate. We also observed reduced abundance of early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical region of pronephric cells. Notably, the catalytic activity of OCRL1 is required for renal tubular endocytosis, and suppression of PIP5K rescues the endocytic defect in OCRL1-deficient embryos.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide the first evidence that OCRL1 regulates endocytic trafficking in vivo and support the hypothesis that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. Moreover, our results reveal PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for these disorders.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that OCRL1 is essential for endocytic trafficking in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, and that its deficiency leads to impaired endocytosis. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, and highlight the potential of PIP5K as a therapeutic target for these disorders. Further studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of PIP5K inhibition in the treatment of these diseases.

Title: Post-Epidemic Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in Livestock Populations in Southern Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Sero-Survey

Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that affects both livestock and wild ruminants in Eastern Africa. While RVF outbreaks occur in cycles of 5-15 years, evidence of inter-epidemic transmission has increasingly been reported in parts of Africa. This study aimed to investigate the presence and determinants of inter-epidemic RVF transmission in an area experiencing annual flooding in southern Tanzania.

Methods: A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle, sheep, and goats in the Kilombero river valley from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. The exposure status to RVF virus (RVFV) was determined using two commercial ELISA kits detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. Information about determinants was obtained through structured interviews with herd owners.

Findings: An overall seroprevalence of 11.3% (n=1680) was recorded, with 5.5% in animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22.7% in animals present during the outbreak. A linear increase in prevalence was observed in the post-epidemic annual cohorts. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection. The spatial distribution of seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots, and animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living <5 km (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.04-3.56).

Implications: These findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area, with a constant exposure and presence of active foci of recent transmission preceding the survey. The study highlights the importance of active serological surveillance in detecting inter-epidemic transmissions, which can pass undetected clinically.

Conclusions: This study provides baseline information on the exposure status to RVFV in livestock populations during the inter-epidemic period and assesses the relationship between RVF seropositivity, animal characteristics, and environmental factors. The results suggest that post-epidemic transmission of RVFV is ongoing in the study area, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and control measures to prevent future outbreaks.

    **Title:** Unconventional Trafficking of GPI-Anchored Proteins to the Plasma Membrane of Trypanosoma cruzi via the Contractile Vacuole Complex

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the contractile vacuole complex (CVC) in the trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of Trypanosoma cruzi, an obligate intracellular pathogen that causes Chagas disease?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the contribution of the CVC to the trafficking of GPI-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of T. cruzi. We generated a dominant-negative mutant of TcRab11, a protein that localizes to the CVC, and expressed it in T. cruzi epimastigotes. We also co-localized GPI-anchored proteins, including trans-sialidase (TcTS), mucins, and trypomastigote small surface antigen II (TcTSSA II), with GFP-TcRab11 in different stages of the T. cruzi life cycle.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that GPI-anchored proteins, including TcTS, mucins, and TcTSSA II, are trafficked to the plasma membrane of T. cruzi via an unconventional pathway involving the CVC. The CVC is enriched in lipid rafts and is essential for the trafficking of TcTS to the plasma membrane. Expression of the dominant-negative TcRab11 mutant prevented TcTS from reaching the plasma membrane and reduced the infectivity of T. cruzi trypomastigotes. However, incubation of these mutants with exogenous recombinant active TcTS and a sialic acid donor partially rescued their infectivity.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of GPI-anchored protein secretion in eukaryotic cells and highlight the importance of the CVC in the trafficking of TcTS to the plasma membrane of T. cruzi. This study provides new insights into the biology of T. cruzi and has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against Chagas disease.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that the CVC plays a crucial role in the trafficking of GPI-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of T. cruzi, and that TcRab11 is essential for this process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the biology of T. cruzi and the development of novel therapeutic strategies against Chagas disease.
Title: Evaluation of a Purified Chick-Embryo Cell Rabies Vaccine Administered via a Shortened Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Regimen: A Phase III Clinical Trial

    Abstract:
    This phase III clinical trial aimed to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen compared to the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross (TRC) regimen. A total of 443 participants received the 4-site/1-week regimen, while 442 participants received the 2-site/TRC regimen. The primary objective was to assess the non-inferiority of the 4-site/1-week regimen to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of the percentage of participants with rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL at day 49 post-first vaccination.

    Methods:
    This controlled, open-label, multi-center study enrolled healthy individuals ≥1 year of age and randomized them into four groups to receive intradermal PCECV according to one of the two regimens, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) administration at the first visit (in adults only). Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations and percentages of participants with RVNA concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL were assessed up to day 365 post-first vaccination.

    Main Findings:
    The results showed that the 4-site/1-week regimen was non-inferior to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of the percentage of participants with RVNA concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL at day 49. The elicited immune responses peaked at day 14 and subsequently declined up to day 365. RVNA concentrations were consistently lower in individuals with concomitant HRIG administration compared to adults not receiving HRIG. The two regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious adverse events reported.

    Implications:
    The findings suggest that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, offering potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination. This regimen could be particularly useful in resource-limited settings where intradermal vaccination is preferred due to its cost-effectiveness.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, this phase III clinical trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of the 4-site/1-week PEP regimen to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of immunogenicity and safety. The results support the use of the 4-site/1-week regimen as an alternative to current recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies, particularly in resource-limited settings.
Title: Unveiling the Dynamic Spatiotemporal Organization of the Salience Network: A Novel Graph-Theoretical Analysis of Large-Scale Brain Dynamics

Abstract:
The salience network (SN), a critical component of the human brain, plays a pivotal role in detecting and attending to goal-relevant events in a flexible manner. Leveraging the subsecond resolution of large multisession fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project, we employed novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. Our results reveal that the SN exhibits distinctive and robust properties, including high temporal flexibility, spatial diversity, and node centrality. Notably, time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN are distinct from all other prefrontal control systems, including the frontoparietal network (FPN), cingulate-opercular network (CON), and ventral and dorsal attention networks (VAN and DAN). Furthermore, we found that temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicts individual differences in cognitive flexibility. Importantly, these findings were replicated in a second retest dataset, demonstrating the robustness of our results. Our study provides fundamental new insights into the dynamic functional architecture of the SN and highlights its unique position in facilitating interactions with multiple functional systems, thereby supporting a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.

Research Question:
What are the dynamic spatiotemporal properties of the salience network (SN) in the human brain, and how do they relate to cognitive flexibility?

Methods:
We analyzed large multisession fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project using novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the dynamic functional interactions of the SN at subsecond temporal resolution. We focused on the spatial and topological properties of SN interactions within a whole-brain system, including key nodes of the SN and a large set of brain regions implicated in various cognitive paradigms.

Main Findings:
1. The SN demonstrated the highest levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, including the FPN, CON, VAN, and DAN.
2. Dynamic functional interactions of the SN were among the most spatially varied in the brain.
3. SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time, indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network interactions.
4. Time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from all other prefrontal control systems.
5. Temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility.

Implications:
Our findings provide novel insights into the dynamic functional architecture of the SN and highlight its unique position in facilitating interactions with multiple functional systems, thereby supporting a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible cognitive behaviors and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cognitive disorders.

Conclusions:
Our study demonstrates that the SN exhibits distinctive and robust properties, including high temporal flexibility, spatial diversity, and node centrality.

    **Title:** VP4: A Novel Viroporin Mediating SV40 Viral Release through Membrane Perforation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of VP4, a late-expressed SV40 gene product, in the release of nonenveloped viruses from host cells?

    **Methods:** To investigate the function of VP4, water-soluble VP4 was expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein from bacteria. Purified VP4 was then tested for its ability to bind and disrupt biological membranes using flotation assays and release of fluorescent markers encapsulated into large unilamellar vesicles or liposomes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that VP4 efficiently binds and disrupts biological membranes, forming pores of ∼3 nm inner diameter in mammalian cells, including permissive SV40 host cells. The central hydrophobic domain of VP4 is essential for membrane binding and disruption. VP4 displays a preference for membranes comprised of lipids that replicate the composition of plasma membranes over nuclear membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid found at high levels in bacterial membranes, inhibits the membrane perforation activity of VP4.

    **Implications:** These findings support a central role of VP4 as a viroporin in the perforation of cellular membranes to trigger SV40 viral release. The release of viral particles by cell lysis after adequate numbers of viral particles have been assembled ensures the efficient spread of the virus. The identification of VP4 as a viroporin provides new insights into the poorly understood process of nonenveloped viral release.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that VP4 is a novel viroporin that plays a crucial role in the release of nonenveloped viruses, such as SV40, from host cells. The membrane disruption properties of VP4 are mediated by its hydrophobic domain, which interacts with the membrane bilayer to form pores of ∼3 nm inner diameter. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of viral release mechanisms and may provide new targets for the development of antiviral therapies. Further studies are needed to determine the specific cellular membranes that VP4 interacts with during viral infection.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Immune Response to a DNA Vaccine Candidate Against Dengue Virus (DENV)

    **Research Question:** What is the contribution of cellular and humoral responses elicited by a DNA vaccine candidate, pcTPANS1, encoding the DENV2 NS1 protein, to protective immunity against DENV?

    **Methods:** We investigated the immune response to pcTPANS1 in Balb/c mice challenged with DENV2. Mice were immunized with pcTPANS1, and their immune responses were characterized by measuring anti-NS1 antibodies, T cell responses, and cytokine production.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that pcTPANS1 induces a robust protection against DENV, characterized by significant levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and T cell responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies conferred partial protection in mice infected with low virus load, but not with high virus load. The vaccine also induced activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ and exhibiting cytotoxic activity. However, the contribution of CD8+ T cells to protection was not evident compared to CD4+ cells. Depletion of CD4+ cells in immunized mice completely abolished protection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the protective immune response induced by pcTPANS1 requires cooperation between CD4+ T cells and humoral immunity. Transfer experiments revealed that animals receiving CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antiserum, both obtained from vaccinated mice, survived virus infection with survival rates not significantly different from pcTPANS1-immunized animals.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the immunity elicited by DENV NS1 antigen and highlights the importance of CD4+ T cells and humoral responses in protection against DENV. These findings have significant implications for the development of an effective anti-dengue vaccine, which is urgently needed to control the spread of DENV in tropical and subtropical regions. Our results suggest that a DNA vaccine encoding the NS1 protein, such as pcTPANS1, may be a promising approach for inducing protective immunity against DENV.
Title: Elucidating the Structure-Function Relationship of the Transcription Factor ComR: A Novel Member of the RNPP Family in Streptococci

    Abstract:
    In Gram-positive bacteria, cell-to-cell communication relies heavily on extracellular signaling peptides that regulate various biological processes, including sporulation, conjugation, and virulence. The RNPP family of proteins, comprising Rgg and original regulators Rap, NprR, PrgX, and PlcR, plays a crucial role in these processes. Here, we investigate the structure-function relationship of ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, which positively controls competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. Our study reveals that ComR is directly activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, leading to the release of its sequestered HTH domain and dimerization, allowing DNA binding. We propose an original molecular mechanism of ComR regulation, which is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues. Our findings demonstrate that ComR is not an Rgg protein, but rather a new member of the RNPP family. Furthermore, we identify XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation, providing a crucial step towards designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci.

    Methods:
    We employed a combination of crystal structure analysis, mutational analysis, and in vivo assays to elucidate the structure-function relationship of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that XIP binding induces the release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization, allowing DNA binding. This activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, distinguishing ComR from Rgg proteins. We also identify XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation.

    Implications:
    Our study provides a detailed molecular mechanism of the ComR activation process, offering opportunities to engineer well-controlled peptide-based expression systems in streptococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. The identification of XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation constitutes a crucial step towards designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our research elucidates the structure-function relationship of ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, and provides insights into the molecular mechanism of its regulation. Our findings have significant implications for the development of new antibacterial agents and the control of gene exchanges among streptococci.

    Title: Functional Characterization of the Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channel ELIC

    Research Question: What are the activating ligands and functional properties of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC, and how does it relate to other ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors?

    Methods: This study employed a combination of electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography to investigate the functional characterization of ELIC. A library of molecules was screened to identify agonists of ELIC based on the chemical features of the ligand binding site. A bound ligand was located in a crystal structure, and the functional properties of the channel were characterized by electrophysiology.

    Main Findings: ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, at high micro- to millimolar concentrations. The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. ELIC forms cation-selective channels with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The high single-channel conductance and simple functional behavior of ELIC make it an attractive model system for studying general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors.

    Implications: The identification of activating ligands for ELIC has made it amenable for detailed structural and functional investigations. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which the binding of ligands induces channel activation over a large distance in a different part of the protein. ELIC's ion conduction properties are closely related to those of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, and GLIC.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ELIC is a cation-selective channel that is essentially impermeable to anions. The crystal structure of ELIC, which shows a non-conducting conformation of the channel obtained in the absence of ligands, is likely closer to the desensitized state of the channel. Further investigation is needed to determine its relationship to the resting state of eukaryotic receptors.

    **Title:** Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) Drives the Atopic March from Atopic Dermatitis to Allergic Asthma

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the progression from atopic dermatitis (AD) to allergic asthma, also known as the atopic march?

    **Methods:** We used a mouse model with skin-barrier defects to study the development of AD-like skin inflammation and allergic asthma. We generated mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j, which resulted in high systemic levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). We also used outbred K14-TSLPtg mice that maintained high systemic levels of TSLP without developing skin pathology.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mice with skin-barrier defects develop AD-like skin inflammation and are susceptible to allergic asthma. We found that TSLP, overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, is the systemic driver of bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Antigen-induced allergic challenge to the lung airways of RBP-j-deficient animals resulted in a severe asthmatic phenotype not seen in similarly treated wild-type littermates. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels are required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that epidermal-derived TSLP is sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be a key strategy to block the development of asthma in AD patients. We propose that in addition to early treatment of primary skin-barrier defects, targeting TSLP signaling could prevent the progression from AD to asthma.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a novel molecular mechanism for the atopic march, highlighting the role of TSLP in driving the progression from AD to allergic asthma. These findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent asthma in individuals with AD.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Genome Organization of Thermotoga maritima: A Hyperthermophilic Bacterium with Distinctive Properties

    **Research Question:** How does the genome organization of Thermotoga maritima, a phylogenetically deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium, differ from other bacteria, and what are the implications of these differences for our understanding of microbial life on Earth?

    **Methods:** We developed an integrated approach that combines multiple omics datasets (whole-genome resequencing, transcription start site determination, transcriptome profiling, and proteome profiling) with bioinformatics tools to characterize the genome of T. maritima. This approach enabled the improvement of gene annotation, elucidation of transcription units, identification of putative non-coding RNAs, and determination of promoters and ribosome binding sites.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed several distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome, including a high number of genes per transcription unit (3.3), a paucity of putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome binding sites showed increased sequence conservation relative to other bacteria. The 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) followed an atypical bimodal length distribution, and transcriptional regulation was limited by a lack of intergenic space for the majority of transcription units. Furthermore, a high fraction of annotated genes were expressed independently of growth state, and a linear correlation between mRNA and protein abundance was observed (Pearson r = 0.63, p < 2.2 × 10^(-16)).

    **Implications:** These distinctive properties are hypothesized to be a reflection of T. maritima's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and could yield novel insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on Earth. The integrated approach described here enables an experimentally anchored annotation of several bacterial genomic features, including protein-coding genes, functional RNAs, non-coding RNAs, transcription units, promoters, ribosome binding sites, and regulatory sites.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of integrating multiple omics datasets with bioinformatics tools to elucidate the genome organization of a hyperthermophilic bacterium. The distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome provide a unique perspective on the evolution of microbial life on Earth and highlight the potential of this approach for studying the genomes of other microbial species.

    **Title:** Contextual Influences on Visual Perception: A Bayesian Model of Visual Inference

    **Research Question:** How do contextual inputs influence visual object recognition and sensitivity to image features, particularly in the presence of weak or missing input contrast at the target location?

    **Methods:** In this study, human observers judged the presence or absence of a target bar at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location, with or without a context of other bars. We used simple visual stimuli of bars familiar in psychophysical and physiological studies of input sensitivities.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context can perceptually group well with the would-be target, weak contrast contextual bars bias the observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without contexts, as if to fill in the target. In contrast, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they group well with the target, bias the observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference is shown to account for the data well, illustrating that the context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence, thereby suggesting that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and highlights the importance of contextual influences on visual object recognition.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that contextual inputs can significantly influence visual perception, particularly in the presence of weak or missing input contrast at the target location. The Bayesian model of visual inference provides a framework for understanding these contextual influences and highlights the role of prior beliefs and internal models in shaping visual perception. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and may inform the development of new models of visual processing.

    **Title:** Defectors Can Rescue Cooperation in Structured Populations

    **Research Question:** Can the presence of defectors, individuals that exploit common goods without contributing fairly, lead to the persistence of cooperation in structured populations?

    **Methods:** We employed an individual-based approach to model stochastic birth, death, migration, and mutation events in a structured population. We used a combination of deterministic differential equations and stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of defectors on cooperation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that defectors can create conditions that rescue cooperation in three ways. Firstly, during defector-induced population collapse, defectors occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperator-only populations to grow. Secondly, defectors cause population extinction, creating empty locations that support cooperator but not defector migrants. This leads to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors can sometimes improve the survival of cooperators. Thirdly, resource limitation, precipitated by defectors, selects for rare cooperator and defector mutants adapted to this limitation, further reducing local population size and favoring cooperation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that defectors can provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation in structured populations. By creating small population sizes, defectors increase variability in cooperator frequency across different locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location. This challenges the conventional wisdom that cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the presence of defectors can have a paradoxical effect on cooperation, leading to its persistence in structured populations. We predict that in a structured population, small population sizes precipitated by defectors provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of cooperation in natural populations and highlight the complex interplay between cooperation and exploitation.

    **Title:** Dead Cell Tropism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: A Novel Host Defense Mechanism against Opportunistic Pathogens

    **Research Question:** How does Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, interact with the epithelial barrier, and what role does efferocytosis play in eliminating this pathogen?

    **Methods:** We investigated the interaction between P. aeruginosa and a polarized epithelium using confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. We observed that P. aeruginosa adheres almost exclusively to sites of multi-cellular junctions, where it binds to extruded apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies. We further demonstrated that P. aeruginosa is internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which surrounding epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that P. aeruginosa exhibits dead cell tropism, binding to both apoptotic and necrotic cells. We found that P. aeruginosa is internalized by surrounding epithelial cells through efferocytosis, where it inhabits an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features. Intracellularly, P. aeruginosa is eliminated after 24 hours.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that efferocytosis is a host defense mechanism that eliminates P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen. This mechanism is particularly relevant in contexts where the epithelial barrier is compromised, such as in cystic fibrosis, where an exacerbated number of apoptotic cells and ineffective efferocytosis may facilitate P. aeruginosa colonization.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel interaction between P. aeruginosa and the epithelial barrier, highlighting the importance of efferocytosis in eliminating this opportunistic pathogen. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat infections in individuals with compromised epithelial barriers.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of the Hedgehog Pathway in Primordial Germ Cell Migration during Drosophila Embryogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) in directing primordial germ cell (PGC) migration during Drosophila embryogenesis?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of loss- and gain-of-function experiments to investigate the role of shf in PGC migration. We also examined the expression of shf and other hh pathway genes, including hmgcr, qm, and gγ1, in the gonadal mesoderm and their effects on PGC migration.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that shf is required for PGC migration and is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm. We also found that the production of the PGC attractant depends on shf and a second hh pathway gene, gγ1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into and through the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. Finally, we show that potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend on cholesterol modification.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the role of the hh pathway in PGC migration during Drosophila embryogenesis. The results suggest that shf plays a crucial role in directing PGC migration by facilitating the long-distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix. Our study also highlights the importance of the hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in generating the PGC attractant.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study demonstrates that shf is essential for PGC migration and that the hh pathway plays a critical role in directing PGC migration during Drosophila embryogenesis. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PGC migration and have implications for our understanding of the development of the Drosophila gonad.
Title: Enhanced Cytotoxic Capacity of HIV-Specific CD8+ T-Cells in Recipients of a Replication-Incompetent Adenovirus Serotype 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 Recombinant Vaccine: Implications for HIV Vaccine Design

    Abstract:

    Background: Understanding the mechanisms underlying protection from HIV infection or immune control over HIV replication is crucial for the development of effective HIV vaccines. Long-term nonprogressors (LTNP), individuals with durable control over HIV replication, exhibit increased cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells, which efficiently eliminate HIV-infected CD4+ T-cell targets.

    Methods: We investigated the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in response to primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T-cell targets in samples from HIV-negative individuals vaccinated with a replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 recombinant vaccine. We compared these responses with those of HIV-negative individuals and chronically infected patients, including a group of LTNP.

    Main Findings: We observed readily detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses in vaccinees at a median of 331 days following the last immunization. The magnitude of these responses was not related to the number of vaccinations or the percentages of cytokine-secreting T-cells determined by ICS assays. However, vaccine recipients carrying the HLA class I alleles B*27, B*57, or B*58, associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection, exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic responses.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles may lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses. These results have significant implications for HIV vaccine design, highlighting the importance of considering HLA class I allele associations in vaccine development.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first direct measurements of recall cytotoxic capacity assessed by granzyme B target cell activity and infected CD4+ T-cell elimination in recipients of an HIV vaccine. Our results demonstrate that HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses can be induced by a replication-incompetent Ad5 HIV-1 recombinant vaccine, and that protective HLA class I alleles may enhance these responses. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV immune control and have important implications for the development of effective HIV vaccines.
Title: Modeling the Coevolution of Jointly Intentional Behavior and Cumulative Culture: A Unified Mechanism for the Emergence of Shared Intentions and Collaborative Behavior in Humans

Abstract:

The evolution of modern human cognition is hypothesized to have been catalyzed by the development of jointly intentional modes of behavior, where individuals collaborate to achieve common goals. This shared intentionality hypothesis suggests that the emergence of complex cognitive abilities in humans was facilitated by a high degree of collaborative behavior among early hominins relative to other great apes. We formally model the coevolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, demonstrating that rapid techno-cultural advance is closely linked to the emergence of the ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant techno-cultural improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. Our results provide a unified mechanism for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior.

Methods:

We employed a computational model to simulate the evolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture in a population of individuals with varying levels of cognitive abilities. The model allowed us to investigate the effects of jointly intentional behavior on the speed of convergence to improved technological norms.

Main Findings:

Our results show that the emergence of jointly intentional behavior is closely linked to rapid techno-cultural advance. When individuals can share intentions and adjust their choice of strategy in tandem with their neighbors, the population converges to improved technological norms more quickly. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant techno-cultural improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against.

Implications:

Our findings provide a unified mechanism for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans. The model suggests that the evolution of jointly intentional behavior is closely tied to the emergence of complex cognitive abilities, and that rapid techno-cultural advance is a key driver of this process. The results also provide a potential explanation for inter-species diversity in the prevalence of collaborative behavior.

Conclusions:

Our study provides a formal model of the coevolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, demonstrating that rapid techno-cultural advance is closely linked to the emergence of the ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior. The results have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of human cognition and the emergence of complex social behavior.

    **Title:** Identification of miR-34 Family as Critical Regulators of Spermatogenesis and Male Fertility

    **Research Question:** What is the role of microRNA (miRNA) in regulating spermatogenesis and male fertility?

    **Methods:** We conducted an expression screen to identify miRNA loci specifically and highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells. We then generated mice deficient in the miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci to study the effects on spermatogenesis and fertility.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the miR-34 family, specifically miR-34b/c and miR-449, is highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and plays a critical role in regulating spermatogenesis. Deletion of both miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci resulted in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm count, aberrant sperm morphology, and impaired motility. Analysis of miR-34bc−/−;449−/− pachytene spermatocytes revealed a small cohort of genes deregulated, which were highly enriched for miR-34 family target genes.

    **Implications:** Our study identifies the miR-34 family as the first functionally important miRNAs for spermatogenesis, whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility. The loss of miR-34bc/449 did not block spermatogenesis per se, but impaired several developmental transitions, resulting in a low sperm count and sperm of aberrant morphology and motility.

    **Conclusions:** Our results suggest that the miR-34 family plays a crucial role in regulating meiosis and the final stages of spermatozoa maturation. The deregulation of miR-34b/c and miR-449 is a definitive causal event in the genesis of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, the most common cause of reduced male fertility or infertility in humans. This study highlights the importance of miRNAs in regulating spermatogenesis and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of miR-34 family in spermatogenesis and to explore potential therapeutic strategies to restore fertility in individuals with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.

    **Title:** Decoupling the Antagonistic and Genotoxic Activities of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)

    **Background:** Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used therapeutically for over a century, yet the determinants of its probiotic properties remain unclear. EcN produces two siderophore-microcins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae and the genotoxin colibactin, encoded by the pks island, which is a virulence factor and putative pro-carcinogenic compound.

    **Research Question:** Can we decouple the antagonistic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of the pks-encoded ClbP peptidase in the antagonistic activity of EcN. We generated a series of ClbP mutants and analyzed their ability to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria while producing beneficial secondary metabolites.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that ClbP is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN, and that this activity is linked to the transmembrane helices of ClbP, not the periplasmic peptidase domain. We also found that a single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivates the genotoxic activity but maintains the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this point mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild-type strain, whereas the clbP deletion mutant could neither protect nor outcompete the pathogen.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the antagonistic activity of EcN is due to siderophore-Mcc, and that the ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect is also observed in other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. This interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2.

    **Conclusions:** Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity of EcN by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN as a probiotic. Our study highlights the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity and underscores the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Nucleotide Sugar Transporters in Cryptococcus neoformans Glycan Biosynthesis and Virulence

    Abstract:

    Background: Cryptococcus neoformans is a deadly opportunistic pathogen responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually due to its ability to cause fungal meningitis. Glycans play a crucial role in the survival and pathogenesis of C. neoformans, with the polysaccharide capsule being a major virulence factor.

    Research Question: What is the role of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) in C. neoformans glycan biosynthesis and virulence?

    Methods: We investigated the subcellular localization, expression patterns, and kinetic parameters of two NSTs, Uxt1 and Uxt2, which are specific for the xylose donor, UDP-xylose. We also examined their ability to transport the galactofuranose donor, UDP-galactofuranose.

    Main Findings: We found that Uxt1 and Uxt2 exhibit distinct subcellular localization, expression patterns, and kinetic parameters. Both proteins transport UDP-xylose and UDP-galactofuranose, and are required for xylose incorporation into capsule and protein. Furthermore, Uxt1 and Uxt2 are necessary for C. neoformans to cause disease in mice, although surprisingly not for fungal viability in the context of infection.

    Implications: Our findings provide a starting point for deciphering the substrate specificity of an important class of transporters, elucidate a synthetic pathway that may be productively targeted for therapy, and contribute to our understanding of fundamental glycobiology.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the critical role of NSTs in C. neoformans glycan biosynthesis and virulence. The identification of Uxt1 and Uxt2 as UDP-Xyl/UDP-Galf transporters expands our understanding of cryptococcal glycan biosynthesis, including the sequence and localization of capsule synthetic events, and sets the stage for studies of an unusual mutant that may help elucidate mechanisms of cryptococcal pathogenesis and host response. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against C. neoformans infections.

    **Title:** Development of a Global Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) Database for Spatial Disease Risk Modeling and Control

    **Research Question:** Can a georeferenced global database be developed to provide open-access to available survey data for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), enabling researchers and disease control managers to support control interventions and monitoring?

    **Methods:** We systematically searched peer-reviewed journals and grey literature, contacted Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistosomiasis-endemic countries, and extracted location-specific prevalence data and survey details for schistosomiasis in Africa. The data were georeferenced and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface, allowing free database access and data management.

    **Main Findings:** Our database currently contains over 12,000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations from 35 African countries, available at http://www.gntd.org. The database has been expanded to include other NTDs, such as soil-transmitted helminthiasis and leishmaniasis. An open-access, spatially explicit NTD database offers unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance.

    **Implications:** The development of a global NTD database enables detailed geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time, facilitating informed decision-making for disease control and elimination efforts. This database can be used to identify high-risk areas, monitor disease trends, and evaluate the effectiveness of control interventions.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing and running a global NTD database, with an initial focus on schistosomiasis in Africa. Our database provides a valuable resource for researchers, disease control managers, and other stakeholders to support the control and elimination of NTDs. We recommend expanding the database to include other NTDs, such as lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma, to further enhance its utility and impact.
Title: Chronic Helminth Infections Do Not Exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection in Cotton Rats

    Abstract:

    Background: Chronic helminth infections are known to induce a Th2 immune shift, which can suppress Th1 immunity necessary for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. We hypothesized that chronic helminth infections may exacerbate the course of MTB infection.

    Methods: Co-infection studies were conducted in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis and an excellent model for human MTB. Immunological responses, histological studies, and quantitative mycobacterial cultures were assessed two months after MTB challenge in cotton rats with and without chronic L. sigmodontis infection.

    Main Findings: Contrary to our hypothesis, MTB loads and the occurrence and size of lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals. Spleen cell proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to purified protein derivative were similar between co-infected and MTB-only infected animals.

    Implications: These findings suggest that chronic filaria infections do not exacerbate MTB infection in the cotton rat model. While these results suggest that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MTB control, they indicate that it may be possible to develop worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases that do not substantially increase the risk for infections.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that chronic filarial infection does not alter control of MTB in the cotton rat model. Histological examinations and quantitative MTB cultures from two independent experiments clearly demonstrated equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burden in co-infected animals compared to those infected with only MTB. These results have significant implications for the development of worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases and suggest that filaria eradication programs may not be necessary for MTB control.

    **Title:** The DEG/ENaC Channel PPK23 Contributes to Male Courtship Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** What is the physiological function of the DEG/ENaC channel PPK23 in Drosophila melanogaster, and how does it contribute to male courtship behavior?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of molecular biology and behavioral assays to investigate the expression and function of PPK23 in Drosophila melanogaster. We examined the expression of PPK23 in chemosensory neurons and its role in male courtship behavior, as well as its response to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7,11-HD.

    **Main Findings:** We found that PPK23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting PPK23 or inhibiting activity of PPK23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses, but delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Furthermore, mutations in PPK23 altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7,11-HD.

    **Implications:** Our data indicate that PPK23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. We propose that PPK23 is a potential candidate for a pheromone receptor or a key component of the pheromonal signaling cascade.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel physiological function for the DEG/ENaC channel PPK23 in male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate that PPK23 contributes to processes underlying male sexual behavior, including attraction to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7,11-HD. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-related behaviors in Drosophila and highlight the importance of DEG/ENaC channels in sensory functions. Future studies will investigate the genetic and physiological interactions between PPK23 and other receptors implicated in Drosophila courtship behaviors.

    **Title:** Mitochondrial tRNA Import in Chlamydomonas: A Co-evolutionary Adaptation to Mitochondrial Codon Usage

    **Research Question:** How does mitochondrial tRNA import adapt to changes in mitochondrial codon usage in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas?

    **Methods:** We manipulated the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing point mutations to modify its codon usage, specifically replacing the GGC and GGT Glycine codons with the GGG codon. We then analyzed the effects on mitochondrial translation, tRNA levels, and respiratory complex activities.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the modification of mitochondrial codon usage leads to reduced levels of mitochondrial translation, decreased tRNA levels, and impaired respiratory complex activities. These effects are linked to the limitations of the tRNA pool in mitochondria, indicating that tRNA mitochondrial import is not a dynamic process that can rapidly adapt to changes in mitochondrial codon usage.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutionary adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. This implies that the information residing in the mitochondrial DNA defines the levels of imported tRNAs to ensure optimal mitochondrial translation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that mitochondrial tRNA import in Chlamydomonas is not a dynamic process that can rapidly adapt to changes in mitochondrial codon usage. Instead, it is a co-evolutionary adaptation that ensures the optimal translation of mitochondrial genes. These findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of mitochondrial translation and the evolution of mitochondrial genomes in plants. Future work should focus on characterizing the tRNA import machinery and the first stages of tRNA import to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this co-evolutionary adaptation.

    **Research Question:** Can continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) be used to identify specific patterns of glycemic responses, or "glucotypes," that reveal heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation, and do these patterns predict the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes?

    **Methods:** We conducted a study using CGM to evaluate glycemic responses to standardized meals in individuals with normoglycemia, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. We developed an analytical framework to group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses, or glucotypes, and compared these patterns to traditional measures of glucose intolerance and diabetes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. We identified four distinct glucotypes, each characterized by unique patterns of glycemic responses to standardized meals. Notably, severe glucose variability was present in 25% of normoglycemic individuals, and within this subgroup, glucose reached prediabetic or diabetic glucose levels 15% and 2% of the time, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that glucose dysregulation, as characterized by CGM, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures. We propose that an increase in glucose variability might precede the currently used measures defining abnormal glucose levels and thus represent an even earlier stage of "prediabetes." Our results also highlight the personal nature of glucose regulation, with individual glucotypes reflecting variable underlying physiology.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the utility of CGM in identifying specific patterns of glycemic responses that reveal heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. Our findings have important implications for the early detection and prevention of type 2 diabetes, and we propose that identification of severe glucotypes via CGM may have greater predictive value for the development of type 2 diabetes than traditional tests.
Title: EDR1 Negatively Regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 Kinase Cascade in Arabidopsis to Fine-Tune Plant Innate Immunity

    Abstract:

    Background: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascades play crucial roles in regulating plant defense responses. The Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) EDR1 has been identified as a negative regulator of plant defense responses and cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EDR1's function and its impact on MAPK cascades remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: How does EDR1 regulate the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in Arabidopsis, and what are the implications for plant innate immunity?

    Methods: We employed a combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches to investigate the role of EDR1 in regulating the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in Arabidopsis. We generated edr1 mutants, MKK4 and MKK5 loss-of-function mutants, and overexpressed MKK4 and MKK5 in Arabidopsis.

    Main Findings: We found that edr1 mutants exhibit highly activated MPK3/MPK6 kinase activity and higher levels of MPK3/MPK6 proteins compared to wild-type plants. EDR1 physically interacts with MKK4 and MKK5, and this interaction requires the N-terminal domain of EDR1. EDR1 also negatively affects MKK4/MKK5 protein levels. Furthermore, the mpk3, mkk4, and mkk5 mutations suppress edr1-mediated resistance, and overexpression of MKK4 or MKK5 causes edr1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death.

    Implications: Our data indicate that EDR1 negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade through direct interaction with MKK4 and MKK5 to modulate plant defense and cell death. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying EDR1's function and highlights the importance of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in plant innate immunity.

    Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that EDR1 directly associates with MKK4 and MKK5, and negatively affects protein levels of MKK4, MKK5, MPK3, and MPK6, which may represent an important mechanism that fine-tunes plant defense responses. The identification of mkk4 and mkk5 loss-of-function mutants and the demonstration of their enhanced susceptibility to powdery mildew provide direct genetic evidence that MKK4 and MKK5 are key players in plant immunity responses.

**Title:** Spatiotemporal Prediction of Infectious Diseases using Gaussian Processes: A Novel Computational Framework

**Research Question:** Can a computational framework based on Gaussian processes be developed to accurately predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms?

**Methods:** We developed a novel computational framework that leverages Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. Our framework exploits the special structure of similarity matrices to obtain an efficient implementation. We tested our framework on the problem of modeling Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases in Turkey between 2004 and 2015.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that the Gaussian process formulation outperformed two standard machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted regression trees, under temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. Our framework's ability to capture highly nonlinear dependencies enabled it to make more reliable predictions.

**Implications:** The development of this computational framework has significant implications for public health policy makers. By providing accurate spatiotemporal predictions, our framework can inform decision-making and resource allocation, ultimately contributing to the control and prevention of infectious diseases.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of Gaussian processes in spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. The proposed framework's efficiency and accuracy make it a valuable tool for public health policy makers. By leveraging the strengths of Gaussian processes, our framework can help mitigate the impact of infectious diseases, saving lives and reducing the economic burden on healthcare systems. Future work will focus on applying this framework to other infectious diseases and exploring its potential for real-time surveillance and outbreak detection.

Title: Investigating the Transmission Dynamics of Rift Valley Fever Virus among Ruminants in Northeastern Africa: A Three-Patch Model Approach

Abstract:
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that causes significant economic losses and human deaths in Africa and the Middle East. This study proposes an almost periodic three-patch model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVF virus (RVFV) among ruminants with spatial movements in Northeastern Africa. Our findings indicate that human activities, including those associated with the Eid al-Adha feast, combined with climatic factors such as rainfall level and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen. We show that sporadic outbreaks may occur when two events occur together: (1) abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the religious festival, and (2) abundant numbers of mosquitoes emerge.

Our numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease pathogen over both short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival time. We investigate the impact on patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch brought by festival- and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, the animal transportation speed from patch to patch, and the death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices. Our simulations show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in patch 3 (the place where the religious ceremony will be held).

This study highlights the importance of considering human activities and climatic factors in understanding the transmission dynamics of RVFV among ruminants in Northeastern Africa. Our findings have implications for predicting and controlling RVF outbreaks, particularly in areas where the Eid al-Adha feast is celebrated. The model can be extended to consider disease latencies in both hosts and vectors, and the importation of livestock carrying RVFV during disease latency, which also impact the pattern of disease outbreaks.
Title: Temporal and Spatial Changes in Human Anthrax Occurrence in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010: Implications for Disease Control and Management

    Abstract:
    We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of human anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010 using a combination of spatial analysis, cluster detection, and weighted least squares segmented regression. Our results revealed a significant increase in human anthrax incidence (+11.95%) from 1984 to 1995, followed by a substantial decline (-35.24%) after the initiation of preemptive livestock vaccination in 1996. Notably, the geographic distribution of human anthrax shifted eastward over time, with cases initially concentrated in the west and south during Soviet governance, and later primarily reported in eastern and northern Azerbaijan during the vaccination period. These findings underscore the importance of an integrated "One Health" approach that considers the changing geographic distribution of the disease. Our study highlights the need for continued control measures in livestock to mitigate the occurrence of human anthrax, particularly in regions with high incidence rates. The shifting patterns of human anthrax in Azerbaijan emphasize the importance of dynamic surveillance strategies and targeted interventions to prevent the spread of this zoonotic disease.

    Methods:
    We analyzed data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax incidence in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. Spatial analysis, cluster detection, and weighted least squares segmented regression were employed to evaluate changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of anthrax.

    Main Findings:
    Our results indicate a significant increase in human anthrax incidence from 1984 to 1995, followed by a substantial decline after the initiation of preemptive livestock vaccination in 1996. The geographic distribution of human anthrax shifted eastward over time, with cases initially concentrated in the west and south during Soviet governance, and later primarily reported in eastern and northern Azerbaijan during the vaccination period.

    Implications:
    The findings of this study have important implications for disease control and management. Continued control measures in livestock are necessary to mitigate the occurrence of human anthrax, particularly in regions with high incidence rates. The shifting patterns of human anthrax highlight the need for an integrated "One Health" approach that considers the changing geographic distribution of the disease. Dynamic surveillance strategies and targeted interventions are essential to prevent the spread of this zoonotic disease.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal changes in human anthrax occurrence in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. The results emphasize the importance of continued control measures in livestock and the need for an integrated "One Health" approach to prevent the spread of this zoonotic disease.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Modulation of the Shaker Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel

    Abstract:
    Voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels play a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of refractory epilepsy. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to modulate the gating mechanism of KV channels, including the Shaker channel, by shifting the voltage dependence of channel activation. However, the exact molecular mechanism of PUFA-channel interactions remains elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we employed microsecond molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the Shaker KV channel in open and closed states and a PUFA-enriched lipid bilayer. Our results reveal a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the channel, located at the protein-lipid interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). Specifically, the lipophilic PUFA tail engages in non-specific hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group interacts with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices, encompassing the S3-S4 linker. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) exhibit increased conformational flexibility in their polyunsaturated carbon tails compared to saturated carbon chains, which may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of PUFA modulation of the Shaker KV channel and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for refractory epilepsy.

    Research Question:
    What is the molecular mechanism of polyunsaturated fatty acid modulation of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel?

    Methods:
    We employed microsecond molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the Shaker KV channel in open and closed states and a PUFA-enriched lipid bilayer.

    Main Findings:
    Our results reveal a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the channel, located at the protein-lipid interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the VSD. The lipophilic PUFA tail engages in non-specific hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group interacts with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices, encompassing the S3-S4 linker.

    Implications:
    These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of PUFA modulation of the Shaker KV channel and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for refractory epilepsy.

    Conclusions:
    Our study elucidates the molecular mechanism of PUFA modulation of the Shaker KV channel, revealing a putative PUFA binding site and specific interactions between the PUFA and the channel protein. These findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for refractory epilepsy and highlight the importance of further research into the molecular mechanisms of PUFA-channel interactions.

    **Title:** Development of a Novel Assay Pipeline for Evaluating Anti-Cryptosporidial Activity of Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH) Inhibitors

    **Research Question:** Can a genetically engineered Toxoplasma gondii model be used to accelerate the in vivo screening of inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum IMPDH and identify novel anti-cryptosporidial therapeutics?

    **Methods:** We developed a pipeline of tools to evaluate the anti-cryptosporidial activity of IMPDH inhibitors, including a genetically engineered T. gondii model that mirrors the purine pathway of C. parvum and depends on CpIMPDH for survival. We also established a fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay that utilizes automated high-content imaging analysis for enhanced throughput.

    **Main Findings:** We used these assays to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors emerging from our ongoing medicinal chemistry effort and identified a subset of 1,2,3-triazole ethers that exhibit excellent in vivo selectivity in the T. gondii model and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. Two promising candidates, A103 and A110, were identified as >100× more potent than paromomycin, the current standard for anticryptosporidial activity.

    **Implications:** The development of this assay pipeline has overcome a significant roadblock in the discovery of novel anti-cryptosporidial therapeutics, which has been hampered by the poor experimental tractability of C. parvum. The T. gondii model provides a rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and a quantitative read of target specificity, allowing for the identification of promising candidates that can be further evaluated in C. parvum.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a genetically engineered T. gondii model to accelerate the in vivo screening of IMPDH inhibitors and identify novel anti-cryptosporidial therapeutics. The development of this assay pipeline has the potential to accelerate the discovery of effective treatments for cryptosporidiosis, a significant disease burden among children in developing countries and a life-threatening condition in AIDS patients.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Loci Regulating Primary Dentition in Humans

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic loci associated with time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year of age in humans?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966) and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We tested for associations between genetic variants and time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year of age.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 5 loci at P<5×10−8 and 5 with suggestive association (P<5×10−6). The identified loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development, such as KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. Notably, genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in the development of cancer. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster was associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and suggest that genetic determinants of early tooth eruption may associate with dental occlusion later in life. The identified genes have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and mutations in three of these genes (KCNJ2, EDA, and IGF2BP1) lead to altered organogenesis and development.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first detailed insight into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and has implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes. The identification of genetic loci associated with tooth development may lead to a better understanding of the genetic basis of tooth agenesis, a common developmental anomaly in humans. Furthermore, the association between genetic determinants of early tooth eruption and dental occlusion later in life highlights the importance of considering the interplay between tooth development and other growth and developmental processes.

**Title:** Dosage-Sensitive Genes in the Hspa13-App Interval Contribute to Locomotor Deficits in Down Syndrome and Monosomy 21 Mouse Models

**Research Question:** What is the role of the Hspa13-App interval in the regulation of locomotion, muscle strength, and energetic balance in Down syndrome (DS) and monosomy 21 (M21) mouse models?

**Methods:** We generated two new mouse models, Ts3Yah (trisomy) and Ms3Yah (monosomy), carrying a tandem duplication and deletion of the Hspa13-App interval syntenic with 21q11.2-q21.3, respectively. We evaluated locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance in these mice and performed expression profiling of skeletal muscles to identify genes involved in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that trisomy and monosomy of the Hspa13-App interval alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance in mice. Expression profiling revealed global changes in the regulation of genes involved in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Notably, these genes were downregulated in Ts3Yah mice and upregulated in Ms3Yah mice. The shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlated with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in respiratory function. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a consequence of changes in the dose of Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j. These findings suggest that the copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.

**Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into the genetic basis of DS and M21 phenotypes and highlight the importance of the Hspa13-App interval in regulating locomotion, muscle strength, and energetic balance. The identification of dosage-sensitive genes involved in these phenotypes may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for DS and M21.

    Title: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Basal and Agonist-Evoked GIRK Channel Activity: A Quantitative Modeling Approach

    Background: G protein-gated K+ channels (GIRK; Kir3) play a crucial role in regulating heartbeat and neuronal excitability. Both neurotransmitter-evoked (Ievoked) and neurotransmitter-independent basal (Ibasal) GIRK activities are physiologically important, but the mechanisms of Ibasal and its relation to Ievoked are unclear.

    Research Question: What are the underlying mechanisms of basal and agonist-evoked GIRK channel activity, and how are they interrelated?

    Methods: We developed a quantitative model of GIRK1/2 function and characterized single-channel and macroscopic GIRK1/2 currents, as well as surface densities of GIRK1/2 and Gβγ in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons.

    Main Findings: Our model accurately recapitulates Ibasal and Ievoked in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons, and correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ. We found that between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel, while available Gαi/o decreases from ~2 to less than one Gα per channel as GIRK1/2's density increases. Our analysis suggests a maximal stoichiometry of 4 Gβγ but only 2 Gαi/o per one GIRK1/2 channel.

    Implications: The unique, unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits, and the cooperative nature of GIRK gating by Gβγ, underlie the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities and allow GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα.

    Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of basal and agonist-evoked GIRK channel activity, shedding light on the complex interactions between GIRK1/2 and G protein subunits. The developed model can be used to predict GIRK channel behavior in various physiological and pathological conditions, and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting GIRK channels.

    **Title:** A Novel Approach for Predicting Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) Targets in Plant-Pathogenic Xanthomonas Bacteria

    **Research Question:** Can a novel computational model, PrediTALE, accurately predict transcription activator-like effector (TALE) targets in plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria, enabling the identification of novel virulence targets?

    **Methods:** We developed PrediTALE, a computational model that accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths and flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. We trained the model on a wealth of quantitative data and benchmarked it using RNA-seq data from Xanthomonas-infected rice.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that PrediTALE outperforms previous approaches in predicting TALE targets. We identified several novel putative virulence targets using PrediTALE, which were not predicted by previous methods. However, we also observed that some TALEs, which we term "orphan TALEs," were not predicted by any tool, suggesting incomplete gene annotations. To address this, we propose replacing promoterome-wide scans with genome-wide scans for target boxes.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of accurate computational predictions of TALE target boxes for elucidating virulence targets of TALEs that support bacterial infection of host plants. We demonstrate that genome-wide prediction of target boxes using PrediTALE enables the identification of novel targets independently of existing gene annotations, including previously missing non-coding RNAs.

    **Conclusions:** Our results show that PrediTALE is a valuable tool for predicting TALE targets in plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. We propose that genome-wide scans for target boxes, combined with RNA-seq data, can detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations. This approach has the potential to uncover novel virulence targets and shed light on the complex interactions between Xanthomonas bacteria and their host plants. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm the importance of these predicted targets in the infection process.
Title: Development and Validation of APOGEE: A Machine-Learning Algorithm for Estimating the Pathogenicity of Mitochondrial Non-Synonymous Genome Variants

Abstract:
The human mitochondrial genome harbors 24,189 non-synonymous amino acid changes, of which only a small subset has been functionally evaluated with certainty. The majority of these variants have been assessed in-silico using software predictors, which have shown inconsistent results. To address this limitation, we developed APOGEE (pAthogenicity Prediction thrOugh loGistic modEl trEe), a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms existing prediction methods in estimating the harmfulness of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations. APOGEE is based on a Logistic Model Tree (LMT) classification model, which feeds third-party predictors with features related to the 13 mitochondrial proteins, such as multi-alignments and amino acid conservation estimates. We trained and validated APOGEE using a curated dataset of 864 known mitochondrial variants, which were randomly divided into training and test sets. Our results show that APOGEE outperforms existing predictors in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.95. We also provide a detailed description of the underlying algorithm, the training and test sets, and the classification ability of APOGEE. The APOGEE classifier is freely available and can be used to predict the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variants, providing a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working in the field of mitochondrial genetics.

Research Question:
Can we develop a machine-learning algorithm that accurately predicts the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variants?

Main Findings:
APOGEE outperforms existing predictors in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, with an AUC-ROC of 0.95. We also provide a detailed description of the underlying algorithm, the training and test sets, and the classification ability of APOGEE.

Implications:
APOGEE provides a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working in the field of mitochondrial genetics, enabling them to accurately predict the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variants. This can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial diseases.

APOGEE is a reliable and accurate machine-learning algorithm for estimating the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variants. Its high performance and transparency make it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working in the field of mitochondrial genetics.
Title: Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Triggers Platelet Activation and Thrombocytopenia via Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) Signaling

    Abstract:
    Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from self-limiting dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Thrombocytopenia, characterized by low platelet counts, is a hallmark of both mild and severe dengue disease and is significantly correlated with disease severity. However, the mechanisms underlying DENV-induced thrombocytopenia are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) in triggering platelet activation and thrombocytopenia during DENV infection.

    Methods:
    We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the effects of DENV NS1 on platelet activation and thrombocytopenia. We first demonstrated that DENV, but not Zika virus, cell culture supernatant induced P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine exposure in human platelets, which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were obtained using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that DENV NS1 binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on platelets, triggering its activation, which promotes subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and enhances platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant.

    Implications:
    These findings suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during DENV infection. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and highlight the potential role of DENV NS1 as a viral toxin that contributes to the complex interplay of dengue pathogenesis.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that DENV NS1 plays a central role in triggering platelet activation and thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. The binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets promotes platelet activation, aggregation, and adhesion to endothelial cells, which may contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. These findings have important implications for the understanding of DENV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage.

    **Title:** Mathematical Analysis of Dynamic Control Loops Regulating Vasomotor Tone, Blood Volume, and Mean Arterial Pressure

    **Research Question:** How do the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, atrial natriuretic peptide system (ANP), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) interact to regulate vasomotor tone, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure?

    **Methods:** We performed a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops regulating vasomotor tone, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure using a model that describes the interactions among AVP, ANP, and RAAS systems.

    **Main Findings:** Our loop analysis revealed the concurrent presence of two different regulatory mechanisms that perform the same qualitative function: one affects blood pressure by regulating vasoconstriction, and the other by regulating blood volume. Both systems are candidate oscillators consisting of the negative-feedback loop of a monotone system, admitting a single equilibrium that can either be stable or give rise to oscillatory instability. Furthermore, a subsystem including ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells turned out to be a candidate oscillator composed of a monotone system with multiple negative feedback loops, and we showed that its oscillatory potential is higher when the delays along all feedback loops are comparable.

    **Implications:** Our results provide insight into the physiological mechanisms ruling long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters, which operate based on dynamical loops of interactions among AVP, ANP, and RAAS systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our mathematical analysis suggests that the physiological mechanisms regulating long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters are arranged into a complex of equivalent loop systems, consisting of candidate oscillators with a single equilibrium point. The well-documented AVP-ANP-RAAS endocrine control of body fluids and blood pressure was analyzed using mathematical tools to highlight the loop arrangement and its dynamic function. Our results have implications for understanding the complex interactions among AVP, ANP, and RAAS systems and their role in regulating blood pressure and blood volume.

    Title: Fibrin Network Permeability and Protein Diffusivity Limit Thrombus Growth: A Novel Mechanism of Hemostasis

    Background: Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies have sought to identify mechanisms that regulate thrombus growth. This study investigates the role of fibrin network permeability and protein diffusivity in limiting thrombus growth.

    Research Question: What is the effect of fibrin network permeability and protein diffusivity on thrombin transport and thrombus growth?

    Methods: This study integrated experiments with model simulations to investigate protein transport through a fibrin network, an important component of a thrombus. Experiments were conducted in microfluidic devices, and model simulations were calibrated to account for the permeable structure of the fibrin cap.

    Main Findings: Our results show that network permeability and protein diffusivity are crucial factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. Model simulations demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus is washed downstream through the fibrin network, limiting exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. Furthermore, the fibrin cap restricts the approach of resting platelets in flowing blood to the thrombus core, impairing platelet activation and limiting thrombus growth.

    Implications: The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events by limiting thrombin transport and platelet activation. This novel mechanism of hemostasis highlights the importance of fibrin network permeability and protein diffusivity in regulating thrombus growth.

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for a previously unrecognized mechanism limiting growth of small asymptomatic thrombi. The fibrin network overlaying a thrombus, observed in mice, limits thrombus growth by affecting protein transport and separating resting platelets from regions of high thrombin concentration. These findings have significant implications for understanding the regulation of thrombogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for preventing thromboembolic disease.

    **Title:** Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) Cells Control Mycobacterium tuberculosis Replication through CD1d-Dependent GM-CSF Production

    **Research Question:** How do invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells limit Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth during infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of iNKT cells in controlling Mtb replication using an in vitro co-culture system of iNKT cells and Mtb-infected macrophages.

    **Main Findings:** We found that iNKT cell activation, as measured by CD25 upregulation and IFNγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. However, iNKT cell control of Mtb growth was CD1d-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFNγ. Furthermore, iNKT cells produced GM-CSF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1d-dependent manner during Mtb infection, and GM-CSF was both necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that conventional activation markers (CD25 and IFNγ) do not correlate with iNKT cell effector function during Mtb infection. Instead, GM-CSF production is a novel mediator of iNKT cell antimicrobial activity. This finding has significant implications for understanding the role of iNKT cells in T cell immunity against Mtb.

    **Conclusions:** We have identified GM-CSF production as a novel iNKT cell antimicrobial effector function and uncovered a potential role for GM-CSF in T cell immunity against Mtb. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells control Mtb growth through a non-classical effector function that is independent of cytokines previously identified as antimycobacterial, such as TNF and IL-1β. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of iNKT cell-mediated immunity against Mtb and highlights the importance of GM-CSF in this process.

    **Title:** Regulation of Candida albicans Colonization by the Transcription Factor EFH1

    **Research Question:** How does the transcription factor EFH1 regulate Candida albicans colonization in the intestinal tract and oral cavity of mice?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of EFH1, a putative transcription factor, in regulating C. albicans colonization in the intestinal tract and oral cavity of mice. We generated efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains of C. albicans and analyzed their colonization patterns in murine models of commensal colonization and human mucosal candidiasis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that an efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, whereas an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and oral cavity of athymic mice. Notably, both efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains caused lethal infections when inoculated into the bloodstream of mice. In contrast, other mutants attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that EFH1 regulates the level of colonizing C. albicans, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. The expression of EFH1 may affect the interactions between colonizing C. albicans and the cells of the intestinal tract, resulting in changes such as altered adherence or altered signaling to the immune system. By reducing colonization, expression of EFH1 may also reduce the likelihood of C. albicans infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that EFH1 is a regulator of the level of colonization during growth of C. albicans in the murine intestinal tract. The expression of EFH1 is crucial for determining the population size of C. albicans during colonization, and its dysregulation may contribute to the development of candidiasis. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between commensal microorganisms and their hosts in maintaining health and preventing disease.

    **Title:** Prolonged Antigen Presentation is Essential for Optimal Development of Protective CD8+ T Cell Immunity against Malaria Liver Stages

    **Research Question:** What is the role of antigen persistence in the development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages?

    **Methods:** We used TCR transgenic cells specific for the malaria circumsporozoite protein to investigate the persistence of sporozoite antigen after immunization with irradiated sporozoites. We found that sporozoite antigen persisted for over 8 weeks in lymphoid organs, dependent on the presence of CD11c+ cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that prolonged antigen presentation enhances the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduced the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expanded in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naïve animals. Finally, persisting antigen was able to prime naïve cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the development of effective vaccines against malaria. The irradiated sporozoite model of immunization is one of the few vaccine models where CD8+ T cells play a major protective role. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this protective response is essential for emulating it with a practical and effective vaccine.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent upon the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen. The persistence of antigen for over 8 weeks after immunization is a critical factor in the development of a robust and protective CD8+ T cell response. These findings have important implications for the design of effective vaccines against malaria and highlight the importance of antigen persistence in the development of protective immunity.

    **Title:** Repositioning Polymyxin B as an Antileishmanial and Antimicrobial Agent via Nanoparticle-Based Delivery System

    **Research Question:** Can polymyxin B (polB) be repositioned as an antileishmanial and antimicrobial agent by encapsulating it in polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles (PBCAnp)?

    **Methods:** PBCAnp were fabricated via anionic polymerization and characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, vertical diffusion cell, and in vitro cell viability assays. The efficacy of polB-loaded PBCAnp (PBCAnp-polB) was evaluated against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes in vitro.

    **Main Findings:** PBCAnp-polB exhibited a sustained release profile, with 50% drug release occurring 6-7 times slower than free polB. In vitro evaluations showed that polB alone reduced amastigote infection of macrophages without complete parasite elimination, while PBCAnp-polB demonstrated leishmanicidal activity and surpassed polB activity. Notably, PBCAnp-polB also exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella.

    **Implications:** The PBCAnp-polB system offers a promising therapeutic alternative for treating leishmaniasis, which is often complicated by secondary bacterial infections. The sustained release profile and antimicrobial properties of PBCAnp-polB make it an attractive candidate for adjuvant leishmanicidal therapy or antimicrobial coating of carriers.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of repositioning polB as an antileishmanial and antimicrobial agent via nanoparticle-based delivery. The PBCAnp-polB system presents a sustained release profile, leishmanicidal activity, and antimicrobial properties, making it a valuable therapeutic option for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Future studies should investigate the in vivo efficacy and safety of PBCAnp-polB in animal models of leishmaniasis.
Title: Prognostic Factors for Death from Visceral Leishmaniasis in Belo Horizonte, Brazil: A Historical Cohort Study

Abstract:
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant public health concern in Brazil, with high lethality rates. This historical cohort study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors for death from VL in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, using data from the Reportable Disease Information System-SINAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) from 2002 to 2009. Two multivariate logistic regression models were developed: Model 1 (2002-2009) and Model 2 (2007-2009). Model 1 identified weakness (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.3-6.4), Leishmania-HIV co-infection (OR 2.4; 95%CI 1.2-4.8), and age ≥60 years (OR 2.5; 95%CI 1.5-4.3) as significant predictors of death from VL. Model 2, which included additional variables from the SINAN Net version, revealed bleeding (OR 3.5; 95%CI 1.2-10.3), other associated infections (OR 3.2; 95%CI 1.3-7.8), jaundice (OR 10.1; 95%CI 3.7-27.2), and age ≥60 years (OR 3.1; 95%CI 1.4-7.1) as significant predictors. A prognostic score was developed using the variables associated with death from VL in Model 2, with a predictive performance of 71.4% sensitivity, 73.7% specificity, 28.9% positive predictive value, 94.5% negative predictive value, and 75.6% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. These findings highlight the importance of identifying prognostic factors for death from VL, which may improve clinical management and contribute to lower mortality rates.
Title: Differential Regulation of BAK1-Dependent Signaling Pathways by a Novel Allele of BAK1 Reveals Phosphorylation-Dependent Control of Plant Growth, Innate Immunity, and Cell Death

    Abstract:
    Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play a crucial role in the perception and integration of external and internal stimuli in plants. The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat RLK (LRR-RLK) BAK1 is involved in steroid hormone responses, innate immunity, and cell death control. We investigated the differential regulation of three BAK1-dependent signaling pathways by a novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5. Our results show that innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent RLKs FLS2 and EFR is severely compromised in bak1-5 mutant plants. However, bak1-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or cell death control. We also demonstrate that the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have very low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. Furthermore, we show that kinase activity is dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. Our findings reveal a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by the regulatory RLK BAK1, which may uncover key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD RLKs.

    Research Question:
    How does the novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5, regulate BAK1-dependent signaling pathways in Arabidopsis plants?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the regulation of BAK1-dependent signaling pathways in bak1-5 mutant plants. We analyzed the effects of bak1-5 on innate immune signaling, BR signaling, and cell death control in Arabidopsis plants.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that bak1-5 mutant plants are severely impaired in innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent RLKs FLS2 and EFR. However, bak1-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or cell death control. We also demonstrate that the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have very low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. Furthermore, we show that kinase activity is dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta.

    Implications:
    Our findings reveal a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by the regulatory RLK BAK1. This may uncover key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD RLKs.

    Conclusions:
    Our results demonstrate that the novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5, regulates BAK1-dependent signaling pathways in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This suggests that the kinase activity of BAK1 is essential for the regulation of innate immune signaling, but not for BR signaling or cell death control. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death in Arabidopsis plants.
Title: Elucidating the Antiproliferative Response to Anticancer Treatment: A Novel Experimental/Computational Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: The antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment is a complex phenomenon involving concurrent responses in all cell cycle phases, extending over several cell generations. Current methods fail to capture the intricacies of this process.

    Research Question: Can a novel experimental/computational approach, combining time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data, provide a comprehensive understanding of the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment in human ovarian cancer cells?

    Methods: We developed a framework modeling environment that enabled the application of different types of modules in each phase of the cell cycle. Time-course measures were taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy in X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells, spanning a wide range of doses.

    Main Findings: The final model provided a complete rendering in silico of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, offering separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2/M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. The model reconciled known effects of ionizing radiations and provided new insights into the antiproliferative response.

    Implications: This novel approach enables a detailed study of the mechanisms concurring to build the response to anticancer treatment at the “cell population” level, accounting for inter-cell variability. The method can be applied to other types of cancer cells and treatments, providing a valuable tool for personalized medicine.

    Conclusions: Our experimental/computational approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment, shedding light on the complex interactions between cell cycle phases and subsequent generations. This novel method has the potential to revolutionize the field of cancer research and treatment, enabling the development of more effective and targeted therapies.

    **Title:** Mitochondrial Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis Deficiency in Podocytes Leads to Renal Disease in Mice

    **Background:** Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a crucial electron carrier in the respiratory chain, and its deficiency has been linked to various human mitochondrial diseases. The biosynthesis of CoQ involves a multi-step process, including the production of polyisoprenoid diphosphate by enzymes encoded by PDSS1 and PDSS2. Mutations in these genes have been associated with severe neuromuscular disease and nephrotic syndrome in humans.

    **Research Question:** We investigated the role of CoQ biosynthesis deficiency in the development of renal disease in mice with a missense mutation in the Pdss2 gene (Pdss2kd/kd).

    **Methods:** We generated mice with a conditional knockout of Pdss2 in podocytes (Podocin/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP) and in other tissues (B6.Alb/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP). We also analyzed the levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in kidney homogenates from B6.Pdss2kd/kd mutants and B6 control mice.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in kidney homogenates from B6.Pdss2kd/kd mutants were significantly lower than those in B6 control mice. Disease manifestations originated specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease was seen in Podocin/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6.Alb/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice had no overt disease despite impaired respiratory capacity and altered intermediary metabolism.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to Pdss2 impairment.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that renal disease in Pdss2kd/kd mice results from podocyte-specific Pdss2 dysfunction. The availability of B6.Pdss2loxP/loxP mice will permit future investigations into the specific sites of CoQ deficiency and tissue damage, particularly in the central nervous system and skeletal muscle, which lead to the heterogeneous but severe consequences of primary mitochondrial disease as observed in human PDSS2 patients.

    **Title:** Cell Lineage Robustness: A Novel Mechanism of Phenotypic Robustness in Multicellular Organisms

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism of phenotypic robustness in multicellular organisms, and how does it arise in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the determinative developmental cell lineages of two protostomes and one deuterostome, using computational simulations to investigate the effects of cell deaths and cell division program failure on the resulting cellular compositions of the organisms.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the determinative developmental cell lineages of these organisms are surprisingly robust to cell deaths and cell division program failure, with only modest effects on the resulting cellular compositions. We identified several features of the cell lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types, that underlie this robustness.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness, which manifests at the supracellular level and is a unique feature of multicellular organisms. This mechanism complements subcellular and cellular mechanisms of robustness to form a multi-layer defense system against environmental and genetic perturbations. Our results also provide a novel explanation of the contribution of ontogenesis to phenotypic robustness, which is especially important for species whose development is predominantly determinative.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that cell lineage robustness can arise as an adaptation to certain disturbances in ontogenesis, and provides experimentally testable hypotheses on the organizing principles of developmental cell lineages. These findings have important implications for our understanding of development, evolution, and carcinogenesis, and highlight the need for further research into the systemic properties of complex cell lineages.
Title: EmbryoPhenomics: An Open-Source High-Throughput Platform for Phenomics in Aquatic Embryos

    Abstract:

    Background: Phenomics, the comprehensive study of phenotypes, has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of biological systems. However, its application is hindered by the need for high-throughput technologies capable of generating and analyzing high-dimensional data, particularly in dynamic processes such as embryonic development.

    Research Question: Can we develop an accessible, high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos, enabling the acquisition and analysis of high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development?

    Methods: We present EmbryoPhenomics, an open-source platform consisting of an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) and the Python package Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV). OpenVIM generates high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under tightly controlled environmental conditions, while EmbryoCV extracts phenomic data from these videos.

    Main Findings: We demonstrate the broad-scale applicability of EmbryoPhenomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistressor responses to environmental change (temperature and salinity) in >30 million images of >600 embryos of two species (Radix balthica and Orchestia gammarellus). EmbryoCV successfully extracted phenome-level data from 95% of the images, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral embryo responses.

    Implications: EmbryoPhenomics can acquire and process data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most dynamic life stages, making it a game-changer for studying development and phenomics. This platform has the potential to underpin the generation of data describing whole-organism responses with a scale, diversity, and quality required to study embryonic development in a manner befitting phenomics.

    Conclusions: EmbryoPhenomics is an accessible, high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos, enabling the acquisition and analysis of high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development. Its broad-scale applicability and versatility make it a valuable tool for studying complex organismal responses to environmental change, particularly in the context of current rates of environmental change.

    **Title:** Stage-Specific Metabolic Rewiring in Plasmodium berghei Reveals Key Targets for Transmission-Blocking Interventions

    **Research Question:** What are the stage-specific changes in carbon metabolism in Plasmodium berghei, and how do these changes impact parasite survival in the blood and mosquito stages?

    **Methods:** We employed stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to investigate the metabolic changes in P. berghei during its complex life cycle in the mosquito and human hosts.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that glutamine serves as the primary input into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in both asexual and sexual blood stages, and is essential for complete male gametogenesis. Additionally, glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are crucial for the ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These findings highlight significant metabolic differences between P. berghei and other Plasmodium species, underscoring the importance of integrating metabolomics data with genomics and transcriptomics to inform drug discovery and design.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the metabolic flexibility of P. berghei and identifies potential targets for transmission-blocking interventions. The data suggest that inhibitors of the TCA cycle, currently being investigated for asexual inhibition of the malaria parasite, may also exhibit transmission-blocking capacity. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of considering stage-specific metabolism in the development of antimalarial therapies.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of combining metabolomics and reverse genetics to elucidate the complex metabolic changes that occur in P. berghei during its life cycle. Our results have significant implications for the development of novel transmission-blocking interventions and underscore the importance of integrating metabolomics data with other platforms to better understand the biology of malaria parasites.

    Title: Decoding Oscillatory Signals in Biological Signaling Networks: A Quantitative Modeling Study of Incoherent Feedforward Loops

    Research Question: How do incoherent feedforward loops (IFFLs) process oscillatory signals in biological signaling networks, and what are the constraints that limit their ability to translate pulsatile dynamics?

    Methods: We employed quantitative modeling to examine the properties of IFFLs in processing oscillatory signals. We used computational simulations to analyze the behavior of IFFLs with varying network parameters and input signal characteristics.

    Main Findings: Our results indicate that the ability of IFFLs to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints. Firstly, the kinetics of the IFFL components dictate the input range for which the network is able to decode pulsatile dynamics. Secondly, a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics is required for optimal "counting" of oscillatory signals. We found that the ability of IFFLs to respond to transient signals but not to sustained signals relies on the property of temporal adaptation in response to a sustained signal.

    Implications: Our study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the processing of oscillatory signals in biological networks. The results have implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits that can decode oscillatory signals, which is essential for understanding how cells process information in natural biological systems. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the dynamic constraints of input signals and network parameters in the design of such circuits.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that IFFLs are capable of processing oscillatory signals, but their ability to do so is limited by specific constraints. The results of this study provide a foundation for understanding how cells process oscillatory signals and have implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits that can decode such signals. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the processing of oscillatory signals in natural biological networks and to explore the potential applications of IFFLs in synthetic biology.

    Title: Development of a Standardized Method for Quantification, Propagation, and Storage of Orientia tsutsugamushi, the Causative Agent of Scrub Typhus

    Background: Scrub typhus, caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia. Despite its significant public health impact, research into the basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity of O. tsutsugamushi has lagged behind that of other important human pathogens. This is largely due to the technical difficulties and uncertainties associated with culturing this bacterium in vitro.

    Research Question: Can we develop a standardized method for quantification, propagation, and storage of O. tsutsugamushi that will improve clinical isolation rates and facilitate in vitro cell biology experiments?

    Methods: A clinical isolate of O. tsutsugamushi was grown in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast (L929) cells. Bacterial growth was measured using an O. tsutsugamushi-specific qPCR assay. Conditions leading to improvements in viability and growth were monitored in terms of the effect on bacterial cell number after growth in cultured mammalian cells.

    Main Findings: We present a standardized method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment, and propagation under various conditions. Our results show that a simplified growth assay can be used to compare the growth of this organism across a range of conditions, which will be useful in other areas such as comparing the antibiotic sensitivity of a range of isolates.

    Implications: Our findings have significant implications for the study of O. tsutsugamushi and other obligate intracellular pathogens. The development of a standardized method for quantification, propagation, and storage of O. tsutsugamushi will improve clinical isolation rates and facilitate in vitro cell biology experiments. This will enable researchers to better understand the basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity of O. tsutsugamushi, ultimately leading to the development of more effective diagnostic tools and treatments for scrub typhus.

    Conclusions: In conclusion, we have developed a standardized method for quantification, propagation, and storage of O. tsutsugamushi that will improve clinical isolation rates and facilitate in vitro cell biology experiments. Our results will be useful to other researchers working on O. tsutsugamushi and other obligate intracellular pathogens, and will contribute to a better understanding of the biology and pathogenicity of this important human pathogen.

    Title: Safety and Efficacy of Praziquantel Treatment in Children Aged 1-5 Years Infected with Schistosoma haematobium

    Background: Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma haematobium, is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world. Current control programs exclude children under 5 years of age due to the lack of safety data on praziquantel (PZQ) treatment in this age group. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of PZQ treatment in children aged 1-5 years infected with S. haematobium.

    Methods: A total of 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 years were treated with PZQ tablets, and side effects were assessed by questionnaire administered to their caregivers within 24 hours of treatment. Treatment efficacy was determined 6 weeks after PZQ administration through schistosome egg counts in urine. The change in infection levels in the children aged 1-5 years was compared to that in 6-10 year old children.

    Main Findings: Pre-treatment S. haematobium infection intensity in 1-5 year olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml urine, with a prevalence of 21%. PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in 1-5 year olds, with an egg reduction rate (ERR) of 99% and a cure rate (CR) of 92%. These results were comparable to the efficacy of PZQ in 6-10 year olds, where ERR was 96% and CR was 67%. Side effects reported within 24 hours of treatment were mild and included stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body, affecting only 3.8% of the children.

    Implications: These findings suggest that PZQ treatment is as safe and efficacious in children aged 1-5 years as it is in older children. This has significant implications for the inclusion of pre-school children and infants in schistosome-control programs.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of PZQ treatment in children aged 1-5 years infected with S. haematobium. The results support the inclusion of pre-school children and infants in schistosome-control programs, which could lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with schistosomiasis.

    **Title:** Identification of Novel Cancer Genes and Pathways Cooperating with Ras in Epithelial Tumorigenesis

    **Background:** Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase Ras contribute to approximately 30% of human cancers. However, Ras mutations alone are insufficient for tumorigenesis, highlighting the need to identify cooperating cancer-relevant signaling pathways.

    **Research Question:** What are the novel, evolutionarily-conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis, and can we identify novel prognostic markers for human epithelial tumors?

    **Methods:** We employed an in vivo near genome-wide, functional screen in Drosophila to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. We used RNAi-mediated knockdown to assay the role of a large number of previously unexplored genes in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our screen identified multiple novel, evolutionarily-conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. Human gene orthologs of the fly hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for human epithelial tumors. Among the top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosophila assays, identifying many known cancer genes and multiple novel candidate genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumorigenesis.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a starting point for the identification of novel genes and pathways involved in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers. Low expression of the confirmed hits significantly correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.

    **Conclusions:** Our functional Drosophila screen uncovers multiple novel and evolutionarily conserved epithelial cancer genes, and experimentally confirmed Tsp29Fb as a key regulator of EGFR/Ras-induced epithelial tumor growth and invasion. These findings highlight the potential of Drosophila as a valuable model organism for genetically dissecting cancer-relevant signaling networks and identifying novel biomarkers and new drug targets for a diverse range of epithelial tumors.

    **Title:** A Novel Paradigm for Meiotic Drive Suppression: The wtf Gene Family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe

    **Research Question:** How do meiotic drivers, such as the wtf gene family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, subvert gametogenesis to increase their transmission into progeny, and how are they suppressed by the genome?

    **Methods:** We investigated the wtf gene family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, previously shown to contain meiotic drivers in wild isolates. We discovered that wtf13, found in lab stocks, is a meiotic driver that kills spores that do not inherit it by generating both a diffusible poison and a spore-specific antidote.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrated that wtf13 is suppressed by another wtf gene, wtf18-2, which arose spontaneously in the lab and makes only an antidote. Wtf18-2 rescues only the spores that inherit it, selfishly gaining a transmission advantage while dampening the drive of wtf13. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic drive suppressors and provides insight into the mechanisms and evolution of drive systems.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the prevailing hypothesis that suppressors of killer meiotic drivers act indiscriminately to rescue all gametes. Instead, we show that wtf18-2 molecularly mimics the Sp Wtf13antidote protein, rescuing only the spores that inherit it. This suggests that ancestral wtf genes may have been dual-transcript poison-antidote meiotic drivers, and that novel duplications of these genes could have been selected based on their ability to cause drive and protect spores from the poison of the ancestral driver.

    **Conclusions:** Our study identifies the S. pombe wtf13 gene as an autonomous killer meiotic driver, joining four other proven wtf meiotic drive genes found in wild isolates of the S. pombe group. The dual-transcript poison-antidote mechanism used by Sp wtf13 is homologous to the mechanisms employed by other wtf drivers, providing a novel paradigm for understanding the evolution and suppression of meiotic drive systems.

    **Title:** Predicting Gene Expression Variation among Human Individuals using Multi-SNP Algorithms and Genomic Annotations

    **Research Question:** Can we develop an algorithm that accurately predicts gene expression changes among human individuals using only their genetic variation, and if so, what are the characteristics of the genes that can be predicted?

    **Methods:** We devised two multi-SNP algorithms that use information from multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the local vicinity of the predicted gene to predict gene expression variation among human individuals. We also developed an extension that incorporates heterogeneous sources of genomic annotations of SNPs and assigns higher relevance to variation in SNPs with particular annotations, such as proximity to genes and high regional G/C content.

    **Main Findings:** Our algorithms demonstrated remarkable robustness in predicting gene expression changes among unseen individuals, even when the training and test sets consisted of individuals from distinct populations. We found that a subset of genes were predicted better by our algorithm when incorporating information from populations other than that of the predicted individuals, suggesting that part of the predictive sequence variation is shared across different populations. Notably, genes that were successfully predicted had higher expression and more variability across individuals, providing insight into the characteristics of the types of genes that can be predicted from their cis genetic variation.

    **Implications:** The ability to predict gene expression changes among human individuals using only their genetic variation has significant implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases and phenotypes. Our algorithms can be used to identify genetic variants associated with disease susceptibility and to develop personalized medicine approaches.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting gene expression changes among human individuals using multi-SNP algorithms and genomic annotations. The robustness of our predictions and the characteristics of the genes that can be predicted provide new insights into the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression, and highlight the potential of this approach for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.

    **Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Competitive Suppression between Virulent and Avirulent Plasmodium chabaudi Clones in Immuno-Competent and Immuno-Deficient Mice

    **Research Question:** What is the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent clone of Plasmodium chabaudi (AS) by a virulent clone (AJ) in immuno-deficient and competent mice?

    **Methods:** We employed dynamical-model based Bayesian inference to investigate the mechanisms of competitive suppression between the two P. chabaudi clones. We parameterized six processes, including adaptive immune clearance of merozoites and parasitized red blood cells (RBCs), background loss of merozoites and parasitized RBCs, RBC age preference, RBC infection rate, burst size, and within-RBC interference, in dynamical mathematical models and fitted them to experimental data.

    **Main Findings:** We found that only one parameter, the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature RBCs, needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. Interestingly, this parameter was the same for both clones in single-clone infections but different between the clones in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice, explaining why competitive suppression was alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. We also found that competitive suppression acts early in infection, even before the day of peak parasitaemia.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the innate immune response clearing merozoites is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones. Moreover, in mixed infections, we predict an interaction between the clones and the innate immune response that induces changes in the strength of its clearance of merozoites.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of competitive suppression between virulent and avirulent P. chabaudi clones. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of virulence and drug resistance in malarial infections. Future refinement of the model, challenged with other datasets, may lead to the discovery of the interaction between the clones and the innate immune response.
Title: Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIRA): A Novel Mechanism for Generating Interstitial, Inverted Triplications

    Abstract:
    Interstitial, inverted triplications are a type of copy number variation (CNV) characterized by the duplication of a genomic region in an inverted orientation. These events are thought to arise from replication errors, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we present a novel model, Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIRA), which proposes that a replication error at pre-existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generates an extrachromosomal, inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate. We tested the feasibility of this model using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results demonstrate that the proposed replication error, involving the ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create "closed" forks, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted inverted repeats. Furthermore, we show that the removal of molecules with two closed forks results in a hairpin-capped linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid, which subsequently integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. Our findings support the ODIRA model and suggest that this mechanism can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs, which are pivotal in human health and evolution.

    Methods:
    We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test the feasibility of the proposed replication error and its downstream consequences on chromosome structure in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

These results have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs, which are pivotal in human health and evolution.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides evidence for the ODIRA model as a novel mechanism for generating interstitial, inverted triplications. Further research is needed to unravel the origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs and their role in human health and evolution.

    **Title:** Systematic Analysis of Alternate Translation Initiation in Mammalian Cells Infected with Influenza Virus

    **Research Question:** What is the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation in mammalian cells infected with influenza virus?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of computational and experimental approaches to investigate translation initiation in influenza-infected cells. First, we performed evolutionary analyses to identify signatures of selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts. Next, we used ribosome profiling with the initiation inhibitor lactimidomycin to experimentally delineate translation initiation sites in a human lung epithelial cell line infected with influenza virus.

    **Main Findings:** We identified several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all of which occur at AUG codons that are downstream of canonical initiation codons. One of these candidate downstream start sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N1 neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and a portion of the transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminidase protein is expressed on the cell surface during influenza virus infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. We did not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response, but the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites.

    **Implications:** Our results provide new insights into the landscape of translation initiation during influenza virus infection and shed light on the evolutionary forces shaping this landscape. The identification of a functionally active viral protein produced by alternate translation initiation highlights the importance of considering non-canonical translation initiation in the context of viral infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study systematically maps the landscape of translation initiation during influenza virus infection and provides the first comprehensive analysis of alternate translation initiation in mammalian cells infected with influenza virus. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of viral infection and the evolution of viral proteins, and highlight the importance of considering non-canonical translation initiation in the context of viral infection.

    **Title:** Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) T3SS Effectors NleH1 and NleH2 Bind to Human Ribosomal Protein S3 and Disrupt Host Innate Immune Responses

    **Research Question:** How do EHEC T3SS effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, interact with host proteins to disrupt intestinal epithelial cell function and promote diarrheal disease?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches to investigate the interaction between EHEC T3SS effectors NleH1 and NleH2 and human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3). We co-localized NleH1 and NleH2 with RPS3 in the cytoplasm and demonstrated that the N-terminal region of both effectors is required for binding to RPS3. We also showed that NleH1 and NleH2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr protein kinases, but their binding to RPS3 is independent of kinase activity.

    **Main Findings:** We found that NleH1, but not NleH2, reduced the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without altering the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits or affecting the phosphorylation state or abundance of the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 repressed the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, but did not inhibit the transcription of RPS3-independent reporters. In contrast, NleH2 stimulated RPS3-dependent transcription, as well as an AP-1-dependent reporter. We identified a region of NleH1 (N40-K45) that is at least partially responsible for the inhibitory activity of NleH1 toward RPS3.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that EHEC T3SS effectors NleH1 and NleH2 disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes, specifically RPS3. This interaction may contribute to the development of diarrheal disease and potentially fatal kidney disease (hemolytic uremic syndrome) caused by EHEC infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EHEC T3SS effectors interact with host proteins to promote disease. The identification of NleH1 and NleH2 as RPS3-binding effectors highlights the importance of this interaction in the pathogenesis of EHEC infection and suggests potential targets for the development of therapeutic interventions.
Title: Feature Motif Models: A Novel Probabilistic Approach for Modeling Transcription Factor-DNA Interactions

    Abstract:
    Transcription factor (TF) binding to its DNA target site is a fundamental regulatory interaction in gene expression. The position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is the most common model used to represent TF binding specificities, assuming independence between binding positions. However, this simplifying assumption does not hold in many cases. Here, we present feature motif models (FMMs), a novel probabilistic method for modeling TF-DNA interactions, based on log-linear models. Our approach uses sequence features to represent TF binding specificities, where each feature may span multiple positions. We develop the mathematical formulation of our model and devise an algorithm for learning its structural features from binding site data. We also develop a discriminative motif finder, which discovers de novo FMMs that are enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and on the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al. Our results show that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human, revealing sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. Our FMM learning and motif finder software are available at http://genie.weizmann.ac.il.

    Research Question:
    Can we develop a novel probabilistic method for modeling TF-DNA interactions that captures complex position dependencies and high-level features, such as palindromes?

    **Title:** Evolutionary Regulation of Adrenergic α2C Receptor Expression in Humans and Chimpanzees

    **Background:** The adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system, which plays a crucial role in the fight-or-flight response. Previous studies have shown that knockout mice for the ADRA2C gene exhibit physiological and behavioral alterations associated with the fight-or-flight response.

    **Research Question:** What is the evolutionary regulation of ADRA2C expression in humans and chimpanzees, and what are the implications for sympathetic nervous activity?

    **Methods:** We examined transcriptomic, epigenomic, and population genomic data to identify regulatory variants responsible for human- and chimpanzee-specific repression of ADRA2C. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays to investigate the functional consequences of these variants.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a cis-regulatory region whose DNA sequences have been significantly accelerated in humans and chimpanzees. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each of which harbors a polymorphism. Our genotyping and analysis of population genome data indicate that the derived allele has reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees, but not in bonobos or macaques. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays show that both derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C, likely by increasing NRSF binding.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees. We also detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the evolutionary regulation of ADRA2C expression in humans and chimpanzees. The identification of regulatory variants and their functional consequences sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the evolution of sympathetic nervous activity in these species. These findings have implications for our understanding of human evolution and the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system.

    **Title:** Convergent Evolution of C4 Photosynthesis: Unveiling the Molecular Signatures of Independent Origins

    **Research Question:** To what extent do separate lineages of C4 plants use the same genetic networks to maintain C4 photosynthesis, a highly complex trait with at least 60 independent origins spanning monocotyledons and dicotyledons?

    **Methods:** We developed a new informatics framework to enable deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. We applied this framework to compare gene expression in two independent C4 lineages, Cleome gynandra (dicotyledon) and Zea mays (monocotyledon), whose last common ancestor diverged ∼140 million years ago.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a cohort of 3,335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. Furthermore, we showed that genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes. Despite the wide evolutionary separation and independent origins of the C4 phenotype, we found that these species use homologous transcription factors to both induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain the cell-specific gene expression required for the pathway to operate. We defined a core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation that is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of the monocotyledons and dicotyledons.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is driven by both convergent and parallel changes in gene expression. The parallel evolution of trans-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis, suggesting that exploitation of extant natural variation associated with complex traits can be used to identify regulators. Moreover, the transcription factors that are shared by independent C4 lineages are key targets for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides novel insight into the molecular convergence of highly complex phenotypes and highlights the importance of deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression in understanding the evolution of complex traits. The identification of shared transcription factors between independent C4 lineages opens up new avenues for engineering C4 photosynthesis in crops, potentially leading to increased productivity in tropical and subtropical areas.

    **Title:** Persistence of Ebola Virus RNA in the Respiratory Tract of a Healthcare Worker: Implications for Human-to-Human Transmission

    **Background:** The 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in West Africa highlighted the need for a better understanding of EBOV infection patterns in different body compartments to develop effective countermeasures. We investigated the persistence of EBOV-specific negative sense genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and positive sense RNA (pos-RNA), including replication intermediate (antigenomic-RNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, in the upper and lower respiratory tract, as compared to plasma, in a healthcare worker (HCW) infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone.

    **Research Question:** What is the persistence of EBOV RNA in the respiratory tract of a HCW infected with EBOV, and what are the implications for human-to-human transmission?

    **Methods:** We longitudinally collected specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as plasma, from a HCW infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in a high-isolation facility in Rome, Italy. We analyzed the levels of EBOV neg-RNA and pos-RNA, including mRNAs and antigenomic RNAs, as indicators of viral replication.

    **Main Findings:** We observed the persistence of pos-RNA and neg-RNAs in longitudinally collected specimens of the lower respiratory tract, even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting possible local replication. The decay of EBOV total RNA, neg-RNA, and pos-RNA over time was significantly different in plasma compared to respiratory samples. The detection of pos-RNA together with neg-RNA in sputum supports the concept of active viral replication within the respiratory tract, rather than plasma spill-over or prolonged RNA stability.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that EBOV can replicate in the respiratory tract, which may contribute to human-to-human transmission. The detection of viral replication markers in respiratory samples, combined with the absence of detectable neg-RNA in plasma, supports the hypothesis that EBOV can actively replicate in lung tissues.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the biological features of EBOV that contribute to human-to-human transmissibility. Further investigation is needed to better understand the clinical meaning of viral replication and shedding in the respiratory tract. These findings have important implications for the development of effective intervention strategies to prevent and control EBOV transmission.

    Title: Investigating the Role of Glycoprotein Domains in the Attenuation and Immunogenicity of Machupo Virus

    Background: Machupo virus (MACV), a New World arenavirus, is the etiological agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF). Junin virus (JUNV), a close relative, causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). We previously reported that a recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing glycoprotein from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of JUNV is completely attenuated in a murine model and protects animals from lethal challenge with MACV.

    Methods: To investigate the requirement of different domains of Cd#1 GPC for successful attenuation of MACV, we rescued several rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 either alone (MCg1), along with the TMD F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). We characterized their replication in vitro and in vivo.

    Main Findings: All rMACVs exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality as compared with rMACV. MCg1 was detected in brains and spleens of MCg1-infected mice and the infection was associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, all animals survived MCg2 and MCg3 infection without detectable levels of virus in various organs while producing neutralizing antibody against Cd#1.

    Implications: Our data suggest that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC contributes to the attenuation in rMACV/Cd#1-GPC, although the ectodomain alone is not sufficient for complete attenuation. The TMD mutation alone is not sufficient to fully attenuate JUNV, indicating that other domains of the GPC may also contribute to the attenuation.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the indispensable role of each GPC domain in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC. These findings provide new insights into the development of vaccine candidates not only for MACV but also for other New World arenaviruses. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuation of arenaviruses and the development of effective vaccines against these pathogens.

    **Title:** Single Amino Acid Mutations in the Histone Fold Domain of CENH3 Induce Haploid Production in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** What is the functional constraint of the centromeric histone 3 variant (CENH3) in Arabidopsis, and can single amino acid mutations in the histone fold domain of CENH3 induce haploid production?

    **Methods:** We complemented a null allele of CENH3 in Arabidopsis with six mutant alleles, each inducing a single amino acid change in conserved residues of the histone fold domain. We tested the ability of these mutant alleles to transgenically complement a cenh3-1 null mutation, support fertility, and produce haploids upon crossing with wild-type Arabidopsis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that many of these transgenic missense lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-pollination, but exhibited frequent post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. The failure of centromeres marked by these missense mutations in the histone fold domain of CENH3 reproduces the genome elimination syndromes described with chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that single amino acid mutations in the histone fold domain of CENH3 can induce haploid production in Arabidopsis, providing a simple one-step method for the identification of non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that altering single highly conserved amino acid residues in the histone fold domain of CENH3 results in fit and fertile plants that display post-zygotic incompatibility and produce haploids when crossed to the wild type. Our results provide evidence that a single point mutation is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, and we identify an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86V substitution within the histone fold domain as a non-transgenic haploid inducer. These findings have significant implications for the development of haploid-inducing lines in crop species.

    Title: Alternative Splicing Regulates Human Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal, Pluripotency, and Tissue Lineage Specification

    Research Question: What is the role of alternative splicing in regulating human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage specification?

    Methods: We modified the H9 hESC line to allow selection of pluripotent hESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns.

    Main Findings: We identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. Our data suggest that alternative splicing regulates hESC self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage specification at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying hESC self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage specification. We identified genes that undergo alternative splicing during differentiation and observed several global trends that suggest functional elements, such as protein domains and microRNA binding sites, are coordinately regulated by alternative splicing. These results offer novel targets for driving the expression of pluripotent cells to distinct lineages and inducing pluripotency from adult cells at the level of specific splice isoforms.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that alternative splicing plays a crucial role in regulating hESC self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage specification. By combining genome-wide predictions of alternative splicing with new functional annotations, our data suggest potential mechanisms that may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance. Further experimental validation and comparative genomic sequence analysis will be essential to delineate common and distinct cis-regulatory sequences that may regulate cardiac and neuronal splicing.

    **Title:** Targeting Trehalose Biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Essentiality of T6P Phosphatase and Implications for Antimicrobial Therapies

    **Research Question:** What is the role of T6P phosphatase (OtsB2) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) growth and infection, and can it be targeted for antimicrobial therapies?

    **Methods:** We generated a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis with regulated gene silencing of the otsB2 gene, allowing us to assess the essentiality of OtsB2 in vitro and in vivo. We also performed a genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with otsA, the gene encoding T6P synthase.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that OtsB2 is essential for M. tuberculosis growth in vitro and during the acute infection phase in mice, but not during the chronic infection phase. Blocking OtsB2 resulted in the accumulation of its substrate, T6P, which appears to be toxic and leads to self-poisoning of cells. We also found that blocking T6P production in a ΔotsA mutant abrogated OtsB2 essentiality, suggesting that T6P accumulation is the primary cause of OtsB2 essentiality.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that targeting T6P phosphatase (OtsB2) could be an effective strategy for antimicrobial therapies against M. tuberculosis. We also identified numerous genes that interact synthetically with otsA, providing potential targets for combination therapies that could minimize the emergence of resistance to OtsB2 inhibitors.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of T6P phosphatase in M. tuberculosis growth and infection, and demonstrates the potential of targeting this enzyme for antimicrobial therapies. The identification of alternative pathways for trehalose biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis also suggests that combination therapies targeting multiple pathways could be an effective strategy for combating this pathogen. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the biology of M. tuberculosis and offer potential avenues for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies.
Title: Elucidating the Conformational Dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi Proline Racemase (TcPR): Implications for Structure-Based Drug Discovery Against Chagas’ Disease

    Abstract:
    Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is a life-threatening illness affecting 11–18 million people worldwide. Current treatments are limited, with poor efficacy and safety profiles. Recent studies have identified T. cruzi proline racemase (TcPR) as a promising target for improved chemotherapeutic intervention. To elucidate the conformational dynamics of TcPR, we employed advanced accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, which extended the effective simulation time scale and captured large-scale motions of functional relevance. Conservation and fragment mapping analyses revealed potential conformational epitopes located in the vicinity of newly identified transient binding pockets. Our results provide new insights into the conformational states of TcPR and the mechanism of ligand-induced conformational changes, which modulate the exposure of critical residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response. These findings constitute an important step toward the rationalization of the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR and provide new opportunities for structure-based drug discovery against Chagas’ disease.

    Methods:
    We used the crystal structure of TcPR in complex with 2 molecules of pyrrole-carboxilic acid (PDB code 1W61) to build our model. Initial atomic coordinates of the apo form of TcPR were obtained by removing both inhibitor molecules from 1W61. Basic residues like Arg and Lys were protonated, and acidic residues like Asp and Glu were deprotonated.

    Main Findings:
    Our results indicate that the mitogenic properties of TcPR are likely associated with the exposure of conserved conformational epitopes located around previously unidentified binding pockets. We show for the first time a model for the open form of TcPR obtained through the application of state-of-the-art molecular dynamic simulation. Additionally, our results suggest that the ligand-induced conformational changes in TcPR modulate the exposure of critical residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response.

    Implications:
    Our study provides new insights into the conformational states of TcPR and the mechanism of ligand-induced conformational changes, which modulate the exposure of critical residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response. These findings constitute an important step toward the rationalization of the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR and provide new opportunities for structure-based drug discovery against Chagas’ disease.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates the power of advanced molecular dynamics simulations in elucidating the conformational dynamics of TcPR. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR and highlight the potential of TcPR as a promising target for improved chemotherapeutic intervention against Chagas’ disease.

    Title: Development of an Inducible and Reversible Gene Knockout (iKO) System in Mice for High-Throughput Gene Function Analysis

    Research Question: Can we establish a general method to efficiently produce reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue in mice, allowing for high-throughput gene function analysis?

    Methods: We developed an inducible and reversible gene knockout (iKO) system in mice by combining two genetically modified mouse lines: a KO line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus (TIGRE). We engineered both KO and TIGRE lines for high-throughput, large-scale, and cost-effective production of iKO mice using recombinase-mediated insertion into mouse embryonic stem cells.

    Main Findings: We successfully created iKO mice in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, allowing for sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. Our results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression upon treatment with doxycycline. The iKO system showed stringent regulation and is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications.

    Implications: The iKO system provides a powerful approach for uncovering gene function by allowing for reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue in mice. This system complements existing inducible gene expression approaches and offers advantages in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility. The ability to generate iKOs for a large number of genes in a cost-effective manner makes it an attractive tool for high-throughput gene function analysis.

    Conclusions: We have established a general method to efficiently produce reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue in mice, providing a powerful approach for uncovering gene function. The iKO system is a versatile genetic tool that can be applied to a wide range of applications, including modeling human diseases such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Our results demonstrate the potential of the iKO system for high-throughput gene function analysis and provide a valuable resource for the scientific community.

    **Title:** Congenital Transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi: Unveiling the Placental Environment’s Genetic Response to Infection

    **Research Question:** How does the placental environment respond genetically to congenital infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that can be transmitted through generations?

    **Methods:** We conducted a functional genomics study using microarray analysis in C57Bl/6J mice infected with two different T. cruzi strains: K98 (TcI) and VD (TcVI), isolated from a human case of congenital infection. We compared the gene expression profiles of placentas from infected and uninfected animals to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the "Secretory Granule" pathway was down-regulated in both infected groups, while "Innate Immune Response" and "Response to Interferon-gamma" were up-regulated in VD infection but not in K98. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm showed that metabolic processes, transcription, and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas, and some pathways related to cascade signaling had opposite regulation in VD and K98 groups. Furthermore, we detected a stronger tropism to the placental organ by VD strain, suggesting living parasites.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first description of the genetic response of the placental environment to T. cruzi infection in a murine model. The results suggest that the placenta develops a strong, parasite genotype-dependent immune response to control infection, which may contribute to preventing congenital transmission.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the genetic response of the placental environment to T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of congenital transmission. The results of this study may contribute to the development of strategies to prevent congenital Chagas disease, a significant public health problem in Latin America. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the placental response to T. cruzi infection and to explore the potential of targeting specific pathways to prevent congenital transmission.

    **Title:** Objective Outbreak Markers for Sindbis Virus (SINV) Polyarthritis Outbreaks in Northern Europe

    **Background:** Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes polyarthritis and rash, known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. Outbreaks of SINV have been reported in northern Europe, with a hypothesized seven-year cycle of reoccurring outbreaks.

    **Research Question:** Can mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes serve as objective outbreak markers for SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe?

    **Methods:** We collected vector mosquitoes from the River Dalälven floodplains in central Sweden during 2000-2003 and assayed them for SINV on cell culture. Obtained isolates were partially sequenced and analyzed using Bayesian maximum clade credibility and median joining network analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes was significantly increased in 2002, with 15 strains recovered, compared to 1 strain in 2001 and 4 strains in 2003. The Maximum Likelihood Estimated infection rates were 10.0/1000 in the enzootic vectors Culex torrentium/pipiens and 0.62/1000 in the bridge-vector Aedes cinereus in 2002. Sequence analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I) and showed local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes constitutes the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. The observed increased SINV-I activity in vector mosquitoes during 2002 and 2009 coincides with the hypothesized seven-year reoccurrence of outbreaks.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first objective markers for SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe, based on mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring SINV-I activity in vector mosquitoes to predict and prepare for potential outbreaks. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind the seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and to develop effective control measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe.

    **Title:** Plasticity at AL-MB Synapses Regulates Odor Representation in the Locust Olfactory System

    **Research Question:** How do multiple coding mechanisms interact and integrate in the locust olfactory system to enable the transformation of dense, transiently synchronized spike trains into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory?

    **Methods:** We employed a biologically plausible model to investigate the role of plasticity at the synapses between the antennal lobe (AL) and the MB in regulating the specificity of Kenyon cells' (KCs) responses to familiar or meaningful odors. In vivo recordings from the locust MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in KCs, with typically only a few KCs from the recorded population responding reliably to a specific odor.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and the MB efficiently regulates the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the observed specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how multiple coding mechanisms interact and integrate in the locust olfactory system. The results suggest that plasticity at the AL-MB synapses plays a critical role in regulating the transformation of dense, transiently synchronized spike trains into a sparse representation in the MB, enabling the specificity and reliability of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for a pre-synaptic mechanism of plasticity between Kenyon cells and mushroom body extrinsic neurons as a critical process in olfactory memory. These findings are consistent with recent experimental results and suggest that plasticity at the AL-MB synapses may be a ubiquitous coding strategy exploited by several different modalities across different organisms. The locust olfactory system provides a well-studied preparation for investigating the interaction of neural coding strategies with plasticity and learning mechanisms, and our results make a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses.

    **Title:** Identification of a Functionally Associated Gene Module Important for Coronary Artery Disease Development

    **Background:** Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex disorder influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. The primary aim of the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study was to determine whether functionally associated genes, rather than individual genes, play a crucial role in CAD development.

    **Methods:** We analyzed 278 transcriptional profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, atherosclerotic arterial wall, and unaffected arterial wall) isolated from CAD patients during coronary artery bypass surgery. Two-way clustering was used to identify functionally associated genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed 60 tissue clusters, with two clusters (one in atherosclerotic arterial wall and one in visceral fat) segregating patients into two groups that differed in the extent of coronary stenosis (P = 0.008 and P = 0.00015, respectively). The associations of these clusters with coronary atherosclerosis were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis expression profiles. Notably, 27 genes in the two clusters relating to coronary stenosis were confirmed (n = 16/17, P < 10−27 and −30). The transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway was overrepresented in all three clusters, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module).

    **Implications:** The A-module was found to be genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold (P < 0.004) in a second validation step using three independent cohorts. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and the expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2-deficient arterial wall.

    **Conclusions:** The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis development and, together with LDB2, merits further attention in CAD research. Our findings suggest that functionally associated genes, rather than individual genes, play a crucial role in CAD development. The identification of the A-module and LDB2 as key regulators of atherosclerosis provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CAD and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    Title: Elucidating the Role of KaiC Phospho-states in Circadian Clock Regulation in Synechococcus

    Background: The circadian clock in cyanobacteria, such as Synechococcus, is regulated by the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian oscillator. Recent molecular genetic studies have revealed that KaiC is involved in the activation and repression of its own gene transcription. However, the specific phospho-states of KaiC that promote or suppress kaiBC expression have remained unclear.

    Research Question: Which phospho-states of KaiC are responsible for the activation and repression of kaiBC transcription in Synechococcus?

    Methods: We systematically analyzed various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional feedback regulation by introducing a combined TTFL/PTO model, consisting of a post-translational oscillator that considers all four phospho-states of KaiC and a transcriptional/translational feedback loop. We tested 32 different two-loop feedback mechanisms and found that only one particular mechanism was able to reproduce existing experimental observations.

    Main Findings: Our model simulations suggest that threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress it. We also found that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative components of kaiBC expression is the main factor determining how the different two-loop feedback models respond to removal or overexpression of kai genes.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of the circadian clock in Synechococcus and highlight the importance of the phospho-states of KaiC in controlling kaiBC expression. The proposed TTFL/PTO model can be used to predict how the circadian output pathways allow the KaiC protein to control several hundred rhythmically regulated genes in the cyanobacterial genome.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals that the phospho-states of KaiC play a crucial role in regulating the circadian clock in Synechococcus. The proposed TTFL/PTO model provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between post-translational and transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution and conservation of circadian clock mechanisms across different organisms, including mammals, where similar two-loop feedback structures have been found.

    **Title:** Characterization of HIV-2 Reservoirs in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of HIV-2 Infected Individuals

    **Research Question:** Do HIV-2 reservoirs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-2 infected individuals differ from those of HIV-1 in terms of cellular distribution and co-receptor expression?

    **Methods:** We prospectively enrolled 14 antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 infected individuals, including 12 non-progressors and 2 progressors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sorted into monocytes and resting CD4 T-cell subsets (naive [TN], central-memory [TCM], transitional-memory [TTM], and effector-memory [TEM]). HIV-2 reactivation was tested in 30-day cultures of CD8-depleted PBMCs, and HIV-2 DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Cell surface markers, co-receptors, and restriction factors were analyzed by flow-cytometry and multiplex transcriptomic study.

    **Main Findings:** HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and was quantifiable in TTM from 4 individuals (median: 2.25 log10 copies/106 cells) but in TCM from only 1 individual (1.75 log10 copies/106 cells). HIV-2 DNA levels in PBMCs positively correlated with those in TTM (r = 0.66, p = 0.01) but not TCM. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in cells from only 3 individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor was distributed similarly in cell populations from individuals and donors. TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts (p = 0.002) than TTM, confirmed by FACS analysis, and a higher expression of TRIM5 transcripts (p = 0.004).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and a limited infection of TCM associated with a lower expression of a potential alternative HIV-2 co-receptor, CXCR6, and a higher expression of a restriction factor, TRIM5.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first immunological characterization of HIV-2 peripheral blood cell reservoirs in individuals infected by HIV-2 with a poorly productive HIV-2 infection and a slow or absent disease progression. Our results shed new light on the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection, suggesting mechanisms close to those reported in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the determinants of the atypical distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs among memory CD4 T-cells.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Description of Selective Attentional Processing in Cortex: The Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) Model

    **Research Question:** What is the neural mechanism underlying selective attentional processing in the cortex, and how can it be mathematically described and implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons?

    **Methods:** We developed the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) model, a spiking neuron model that provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in the cortex. The model is mathematically described and implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons, with computations for performing selective attentional processing mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry.

    **Main Findings:** The ARC model demonstrates that with shifts of spatial attention, neurons may exhibit shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features (i.e., response gain), and that the effect on contrast-response functions is better explained as a response-gain effect than as contrast-gain. The model also predicts that the seemingly different forms of attentional modulation are consequences of a single mechanism for selective attentional routing.

    **Implications:** The ARC model overcomes limitations of past models by providing a unified explanation of this set of attentional effects, being implemented in spiking neurons, defining the relationship of attentional modulation across multiple cortical areas, and making several detailed testable predictions. The model's mechanisms for selective routing predict that spatial attention only affects neural spatial selectivity, without altering selectivity for other feature dimensions.

    **Conclusions:** We present a model of visual attention that provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in cortex. The ARC model is fully implemented in spiking neurons, and the computations for performing selective attentional processing have been mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. The model's predictions are consistent with a wide array of available data, and it makes several specific and quantifiable predictions that can be tested experimentally. The ARC model provides a new framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of selective attentional processing in the cortex.

**Title:** Whole Exome Sequencing Reveals Limited Contribution of Coding Variation to Atrial Fibrillation Susceptibility

**Background:** Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex and heritable arrhythmia associated with significant morbidity. Despite the identification of over 35 genes linked to AF, the causal variants and genes underlying this condition remain poorly understood.

**Research Question:** What is the contribution of coding genetic variation to AF susceptibility in a large community-based sample?

**Methods:** We analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 controls from the Framingham Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and NHLBI-GO Exome Sequencing Project. We also examined whether genetic variation was enriched in suspected AF genes (N = 37) in AF cases versus controls.

**Main Findings:** None of the 99,404 common variants evaluated was significantly associated with AF after adjusting for multiple testing. However, a common missense variant in SYNPO2L (rs3812629, p.Pro707Leu) was significantly associated with AF (odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.43, P = 6.6x10-5). We did not observe significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Individuals with AF did not display any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. Efforts to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF may require large sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects, such as those with early onset AF or consanguineous populations.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the complexity of AF and the need for further research to elucidate the genetic contributions to this condition. The identification of a coding variant in SYNPO2L requires further evaluation to determine whether it is causally related to AF. Our findings underscore the importance of large-scale sequencing efforts to clarify the genetic contributions to AF and identify potential therapeutic targets.

    **Title:** Human Alveolar Echinococcosis in Poland: A 20-Year Retrospective Study

    **Background:** Alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is a zoonotic disease with increasing incidence in the Northern Hemisphere. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of human AE in Poland over the past two decades.

    **Methods:** We collected and analyzed data on human AE cases in Poland from 1990 to 2011, including both officially registered and detected cases through active field and laboratory surveillance. Cases were verified using clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria.

    **Findings:** A total of 121 human AE cases were detected, with 83 (68.6%) classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. We observed a continuous increase in detection rate over the two decades. The cases ranged in age from 6 to 82 years (mean 47.7 years), with a male-to-female sex ratio of 0.86:1. The disease was fatal in 23 (19%) patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. Family agglomeration of AE was found in 4 foci, involving 9 patients. The liver was the primary location of AE in all cases, and 30 (24.8%) patients showed spread to other organs. Albendazole treatment was administered to 94 patients, and 73 (60%) underwent surgical operation, including 15 liver transplantations.

    **Implications:** Our study confirms that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, ranking the country as the fourth in Europe with over 120 cases detected. The results highlight the need for a wider national program to implement screening in high-risk areas (north-eastern Poland) and increase public awareness of the risk of contracting E. multilocularis. Furthermore, training of primary care physicians in the recognition of AE risk is essential for early detection of this dangerous disease.

    **Conclusion:** This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology of human AE in Poland, emphasizing the importance of continued surveillance, public awareness, and healthcare provider education to combat this zoonotic disease.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of Zinc-Sensing Zinc Uptake Regulator (Zur) Protein in Escherichia coli: Implications for Gene Regulation and Metal Homeostasis

    Abstract:

    Background: Commensal microbes, whether beneficial or pathogenic, are sensitive to fluctuations in local zinc concentration, which can starve or swamp the prokaryote. To understand how microorganisms coordinate a dynamic response to changes in zinc availability at the molecular level, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli.

    Methods: We solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and demonstrated that this metalloregulatory protein represses gene expression by cooperative binding of two adjacent dimers to the core element of each of the Zur-regulated promoters. We also analyzed the protein-DNA interface and discovered a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly, and the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. We observed a 10,000-fold variation in Zur-DNA binding constants across four Zur-regulon promoters and a 100-fold difference in the degree of Zur repression observed in vivo.

    Implications: These findings provide strong support for the idea that the thermodynamics of an ensemble of protein-DNA interactions play a dominant role in the physiological control of gene regulation networks. Our results open the door to understanding how zinc availability and partial metal occupancy at a subset of the eight zinc binding sites in the repressor complex can fine-tune stress-responsive gene expression across a range of promoters.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals a layer of regulatory tuning based on differential affinities of zinc-saturated Zur dimers for the various promoters in this regulon. These findings have significant implications for understanding how bacteria optimize cellular physiology in the face of dynamic shifts in metal availability and highlight the importance of considering the thermodynamics of protein-DNA interactions in the regulation of gene expression networks.

    **Title:** Understanding the Recurrent Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in Madagascar Highlands

    **Research Question:** What are the key determinants of the recurrent transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) in the Anjozorobe district of Madagascar highlands?

    **Methods:** A spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions using observational data collected in the area. Three scenarios that could explain the RVFV recurrent circulation in the area were analyzed: (i) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, vectors being absent during the winter, (ii) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population, without direct transmission between cattle, and (iii) a combination of both mechanisms.

    **Main Findings:** Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations, with 84% of cattle infections attributed to vector-borne transmission and 16% to direct transmission. Sensitivity analysis showed that these results were robust.

    **Implications:** The study suggests that the recurrent circulation of RVFV in the Madagascar highlands is attributable to both vector-based transmission (for the main part) and direct transmission at calving of viraemic cows. Socio-economic practices of the area, such as agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices, are determinant in virus introduction, spread, and persistence.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the dynamics of RVFV transmission in a temperate and mountainous ecosystem. The results highlight the importance of considering both vector-borne and direct transmission mechanisms in understanding the recurrent circulation of RVFV in the Madagascar highlands. The findings have implications for the development of effective control and prevention strategies for RVFV in this region.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Invasion History and Population Structure of the Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in the Indo-Pacific Region

    **Research Question:** What are the historical and contemporary movements of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in the Indo-Pacific region, and what is its population structure?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 13 nuclear microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences to investigate the population genetics of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was employed to test competing historical routes of invasion of Ae. albopictus within the Southeast (SE) Asian/Australasian region.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or SE Asia. The analysis also supported that the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait Islands was seeded chiefly from Indonesia. Notably, we found evidence of a recently colonized population (the Torres Strait Islands) that has undergone rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be the result of genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the invasion history and population structure of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region. The high spatial genetic structure and high gene flow between some geographically distant populations suggest that the species' genetic structure in the region is driven mostly by human movements. Our findings have significant implications for public health, as Ae. albopictus is a major public health threat throughout its expanding range.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the invasion history and population structure of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the genetic connectivity and population structure of invasive species to inform effective management and control strategies. The use of ABC analysis has allowed us to reconstruct the most probable invasion history of Ae. albopictus in the Australasian region, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of this highly invasive species.
Title: Investigating the Impact of Schistosoma mansoni Infection on Quality of Life and Physical Fitness in Schoolchildren: A Cross-Sectional Study in Tanzania

Abstract:
Schistosoma mansoni infection is a significant public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly among children. This study aimed to investigate the effect of S. mansoni infection on a panel of morbidity indicators, including quality of life (PedsQL) and physical fitness (VO2 max), among 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. We found that 58.7% of the children were infected with S. mansoni, with an arithmetic mean intensity of 207.3 eggs per gram (epg). Most infections were light (56.5%), while 16.4% had heavy infections. Girls had significantly higher arithmetic mean intensities than boys (247.4 epg vs. 153.2 epg; P = 0.004). However, we found no association between S. mansoni prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anaemia, liver or spleen pathology. In contrast, children with S. mansoni infection had a significantly lower score in emotional PedsQL (77.3 vs. 82.7; P = 0.033) and a higher VO2 max (51.4 vs. 50.8; P = 0.042) compared to uninfected children. In multivariable linear regression analyses, age, S. mansoni infection, haemoglobin, and VO2 max were significant predictors for emotional PedsQL, while physical PedsQL, height, age, and haemoglobin were significant predictors for VO2 max. Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection has a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness. These results highlight the need for more in-depth studies to refine the PedsQL tool to focus on aspects of quality of life that may be affected by schistosome infections.
Title: Investigating Leptospira Infection in Rats: A Comparative Study of Subcutaneous, Mucosal, and Intraperitoneal Inoculation Routes

    Abstract:
    Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete Leptospira, is a significant public health concern worldwide. Wild rodents, including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), serve as the primary reservoirs of Leptospira, often harboring asymptomatic infections. To better understand the mechanisms of Leptospira infection in rats, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation routes on renal colonization and urinary excretion compared to the traditional intraperitoneal route. Using Leptospira renal isolation, serology, and molecular and histological analyses, we found that all three inoculation routes resulted in asymptomatic infections with similar antibody production. However, mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. These findings provide valuable insights into the infection modalities in rats and highlight the importance of studying natural infection routes in rat models to increase our understanding of rat-rat disease transmission. Future studies of other natural inoculation routes will facilitate the investigation of infection kinetics and contribute to the development of effective prevention and control strategies for Leptospirosis.

    Research Question:
    What are the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation routes on renal colonization and urinary excretion of Leptospira infection compared to the reference intraperitoneal inoculation route in adult rats?

    Methods:
    Adult rats were inoculated with Leptospira using subcutaneous, mucosal, and intraperitoneal routes. Infection characteristics were studied using Leptospira renal isolation, serology, and molecular and histological analyses.

    Main Findings:
    Leptospira infection was asymptomatic using each inoculation route, and caused similar antibody production regardless of renal colonization. The observed renal colonization rates were 8 out of 8 rats, 5 out of 8 rats, and 1 out of 8 rats for the intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous inoculation routes, respectively. Mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route.

    Implications:
    These findings provide valuable insights into the infection modalities in rats and highlight the importance of studying natural infection routes in rat models to increase our understanding of rat-rat disease transmission. Future studies of other natural inoculation routes will facilitate the investigation of infection kinetics and contribute to the development of effective prevention and control strategies for Leptospirosis.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates that mucosal inoculation is a more efficient route for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induces a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. These findings have significant implications for the development of effective prevention and control strategies for Leptospirosis and highlight the importance of studying natural infection routes in rat models to increase our understanding of rat-rat disease transmission.

    **Title:** Annexin A2 Inhibits Pro-inflammatory Response in Sepsis by Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species and IL-17 Signaling

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in modulating the inflammatory response during sepsis, and how does it interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-17 signaling pathways?

    **Methods:** We employed a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model in AnxA2 knockout (anxa2-/-) mice to investigate the role of AnxA2 in sepsis pathogenesis. We also used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the critical amino acid (aa) responsible for AnxA2's regulation of ROS levels. Additionally, we used CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) strategy to deplete IL-17 in anxa2-/- mice.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that AnxA2 deficiency leads to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance in sepsis models. We found that cysteine 9 of AnxA2 is crucial for regulating ROS levels, and that ROS is responsible for elevated IL-17A levels and subsequent exaggerated inflammatory response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas9 KO strategy down-regulated inflammation and conferred protection against sepsis in anxa2-/- mice.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel role for AnxA2 in inhibiting pro-inflammatory response during sepsis via an AnxA2-ROS-IL-17 axis. This suggests that AnxA2 may mitigate the severity of sepsis by modulating ROS and IL-17A levels. Targeting neutrophils in sepsis may have therapeutic potential, as AnxA2 deficiency-induced neutrophil infiltration contributes to severe local and distant organ injury and higher mortality in sepsis mice.

    **Conclusions:** Our study identifies AnxA2 as a critical mediator in host defense against sepsis, and highlights the importance of the AnxA2-ROS-IL-17 axis in regulating the inflammatory response during sepsis. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of sepsis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.

    **Title:** MicroRNA-155 Mediates Anti-HIV-1 Effects in Macrophages by Targeting HIV-1 Dependency Factors

    **Background:** HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3 and 4, respectively, have been shown to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs).

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism underlying the anti-HIV-1 effects of poly(I:C) and LPS in MDMs?

    **Methods:** We stimulated MDMs with poly(I:C), LPS, or TLR2, TLR7, or TLR9 agonists and assessed HIV-1 infection using CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions.

    **Main Findings:** Poly(I:C) and LPS stimulation abrogated HIV-1 infection in MDMs, while TLR2, TLR7, or TLR9 agonists only partially reduced infection. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed increased microRNA-155 (miR-155) levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4-stimulation. A miR-155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated MDMs, and ectopic miR-155 expression remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection in primary MDMs and cell lines.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the anti-HIV-1 effects of poly(I:C) and LPS in MDMs, involving the upregulation of miR-155, which targets HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events. These findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of HIV-1 restriction in macrophages and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection.

    **Title:** Temporal Integration of Circadian Clock, Light Signaling, and Phytohormone Pathways Regulates Growth in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** How do the circadian clock, light signaling, and phytohormone pathways interact to control growth rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana?

    **Methods:** We employed DNA microarrays to analyze the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling transcriptome under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds. We identified a group of plant hormone-associated genes that are coexpressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a cis-acting element (CACATG) in phytohormone gene promoters is sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo. We also found that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which the circadian clock, light signaling, and phytohormone pathways interact to regulate growth rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine-tune phytohormone responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that the circadian clock acts upstream of light signaling to gate phytohormone gene expression during the early evening. We propose that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between the circadian clock, light signaling, and phytohormone pathways, and highlights the importance of temporal integration in regulating growth and development in plants.

    **Title:** Systemic RNA Interference in Rhodnius prolixus: A Paratransgenic Strategy for Sustainable Vector Control

    **Research Question:** Can the insect microbiota be modified to deliver molecules to the gut of Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas disease, to induce systemic RNA interference (RNAi) and reduce its fitness?

    **Methods:** We used Escherichia coli HT115 (DE3) and Rhodococcus rhodnii, a natural symbiont of R. prolixus, to deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific for the Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT) genes. The bacteria were fed to nymphs and adult stages of R. prolixus, and the effects on gene expression and insect fitness were evaluated.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that feeding E. coli HT115 (DE3) expressing RHBP and CAT dsRNA to R. prolixus nymphs and adults resulted in systemic and temporal RNAi effects. Concentrations of E. coli HT115 (DE3) above 3.35 × 10^7 CFU/mL produced significant RHBP and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. RHBP expression in the fat body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after feeding. CAT expression was reduced by 99% and 96% in the ovary and posterior midgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. Mortality rates increased by 24-30% in first instars fed RHBP and CAT bacteria. Molting rates were reduced by 100% in first instars and 80% in third instars fed bacteria producing RHBP or CAT dsRNA. Oviposition was reduced by 43% (RHBP) and 84% (CAT). Embryogenesis was arrested in 16% (RHBP) and 20% (CAT) of laid eggs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy for sustainable vector control. The E. coli system may be used as an effective high-throughput system to screen for targets to be further tested with the symbiont, R. rhodnii.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that oral delivery of bacteria expressing dsRNA for CAT or RHBP can affect the normal development of nymphs and female fecundity. Our results show that E. coli can express and deliver RHBP and CAT dsRNA into the midgut of R. prolixus, leading to the systemic spread of RNAi to the fat body, anterior and posterior midgut, and ovaries. Modified symbiotic R. rhodnii also were effective at inducing gene silencing with physiological effects.
Title: Investigating the Causes of Fever in Pregnancy on the Thai-Burmese Border: A Prospective Cohort Study

    Abstract:
    Background: Fever in pregnancy is a significant risk factor for maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, particularly in resource-poor populations. Despite the decline in malaria incidence, the etiology of fever in pregnancy remains poorly understood in these settings.

    Research Question: What are the causes of fever in pregnant women attending antenatal clinics on the Thai-Burmese border, and how do these causes impact pregnancy outcomes?

    Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled 8,117 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics from January 2004 to May 2006. Women with fever underwent comprehensive clinical and laboratory screening, including malaria smear, and were followed up weekly until delivery. Convalescent serum was collected on day 21. Delivery outcomes were recorded.

    Main Findings: Febrile episodes occurred in 5.0% (409/8,117) of pregnant women, with malaria being the leading cause (55.5%, 227/409). Arthropod-borne diseases (malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue) and zoonotic diseases (leptospirosis) accounted for nearly half of all febrile illnesses (47.3%, 96/203). Coinfection was observed in 3.9% (8/203) of women, mostly malaria and rickettsia. Pyelonephritis was also a common cause of fever (19.7%, 40/203). Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight.

    Implications: Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy on the Thai-Burmese border. Scrub and murine typhus are also significant causes of fever associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Febrile pregnant women without malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection should be treated with azithromycin, effective for typhus and leptospirosis.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of investigating the causes of fever in pregnancy in resource-poor populations. The findings suggest that arthropod-borne and zoonotic diseases are significant contributors to febrile illnesses in pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border. Early detection and treatment of these diseases are crucial to reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Further research is needed to develop effective diagnostic tools and treatment strategies for febrile pregnant women in these settings.

    **Title:** Maternal Age and Recombination Rate in Humans: A Genome-Wide Analysis

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans, and how does this relationship impact the mechanisms involved in human trisomies?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide analysis of recombination events in 69 French-Canadian pedigrees, genotyping over 600,000 markers to localize crossovers at high resolution. We observed recombination events in 195 maternal meioses and analyzed the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age in humans, which is likely driven by chromosome-specific effects. The effect is localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. We observed a significant decay in crossovers with maternal age, particularly in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the protection against non-disjunction provided by recombination becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age, which can contribute to the higher rates of aneuploidy in older women. We propose a model that reconciles our findings with reported associations between maternal age and recombination in cases of trisomies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans, highlighting the importance of chromosome-specific effects in determining the complex relationship between maternal age and recombination. Our results support the hypothesis that chromosome-specific effects may vary among populations depending on genetic differences in factors regulating the recombination machinery. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in human trisomies and the impact of maternal age on aneuploidy. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans.
Title: Induction of Innate Memory in Macrophages via IFN-γ Priming: A Novel Mechanism for Vaccine-Mediated Protection against Opportunistic Infections

    Abstract:

    Background: Opportunistic infections pose a significant threat to immunocompromised patients, particularly those with deficiencies in the adaptive immune system. Developing effective vaccines against these pathogens is challenging due to the compromised immune status of the target population.

    Research Question: Can IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo induce an innate memory-like phenotype that provides protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells?

    Methods: We utilized an experimental immunization strategy to prime macrophages with IFN-γ in vivo and assessed the resulting innate memory-like phenotype using RNA-seq analysis, cytokine recall responses, and histone modifications.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo induces a rapid up-regulation of IFN-γ and STAT1 signaling pathways following secondary challenge, resulting in complete protection against C. neoformans infection. The enhanced cytokine recall responses were pathogen-specific, dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation, and correlated with increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo is a novel and effective mechanism for inducing vaccine-mediated protection against opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. This approach selectively targets IFN-γ associated genes, leaving residual TLR and CLR functions intact for host-defense mechanisms.

    Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that macrophages can be primed in vivo with C. neoformans/IFN-γ to expediently activate the STAT1 pathway, maintain the innate memory phenotype for at least 70 days, and provide complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. Our results have significant implications for the development of novel immunization strategies that drive memory-like innate immune responses, providing a promising approach for inducing vaccine-mediated protection in immunocompromised patients.

    **Title:** Context-Dependent Regulation of Plant Developmental Programs by Polycomb Repressive Complexes

    **Background:** Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play crucial roles in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. However, the underlying molecular mechanism determining the target specificity and functional diversity of PRCs in plants is not well-characterized.

    **Research Question:** How do different members of PRCs regulate distinct plant developmental programs, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We used a quantitative approach to compare genome-wide changes of H3K27me3 and gene expression profiles in loss-of-function mutants of PRC1 (AtBMI1, AtRING1, and LHP1) and PRC2 (CLF) components in Arabidopsis seedlings.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 in the suppression of distinct plant developmental programs. We found that expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via a non-redundant role of CLF, which specifically associates with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). In contrast, expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that different combinations of PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific transcription factors (TFs). We propose that the context-dependent role of CLF corresponds well with the change in H3K27me3 profiles and is associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of TFs, including MADS box and ABA-related factors.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the target specificity and functional diversity of PRCs in plants. We demonstrate that PRC2 composition regulates differential transcriptional programs, which is analogous to a recent genome-wide study on human blood cell development. Our findings have important implications for understanding the complex regulation of plant development and the role of PRCs in this process.

    **Title:** Dissecting the Trigger Loop of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA Polymerase II at Individual-Residue Resolution

    **Research Question:** What are the functional contributions of individual residues within the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to its dynamics, catalysis, and evolutionary constraints?

    **Methods:** We employed a structural genetics approach to quantitatively phenotype nearly all TL single variants en masse in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allowed us to identify three mutant classes with distinct distributions among TL residues, linked to transcription defects or various stresses.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that mutations disrupting an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed to facilitate substrate-triggered TL folding, confer phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and increased catalysis. Additionally, allele-specific genetic interactions among TL and TL-proximal domain residues support the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices (BH) to TL dynamics.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide high-resolution insights into the functional contributions of individual TL residues to its dynamics, catalysis, and evolutionary constraints. The phenotypic landscape strategy employed in this study expands the scope of existing deep mutational scanning studies and can be generalized to study most, if not all, yeast proteins.

    **Conclusions:** Our structural genetics approach has advanced our understanding of Pol II mechanisms and has identified many predicted gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) TL variants, some of which are predicted to confer epistatic interactions. These findings support a multi-step TL folding model for the promotion of catalysis and highlight the critical role of TL opening in enzyme translocation relative to the DNA template. The dynamic conversion between TL states is essential for its functions, and perturbations result in distinct consequences for transcriptional activity, manifesting as LOF and GOF phenotypes in vivo.

**Title:** Hematogenous Spread of Rabies Virus: A Novel Pathway for Central Nervous System Invasion

**Research Question:** Can certain rabies virus (RV) variants invade the central nervous system (CNS) via hematogenous spread from the periphery, and if so, what are the implications for post-exposure prophylaxis?

**Methods:** We infected mice intramuscularly (i.m.) or intravenously (i.v.) with the dog-associated RV strain DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV strain SB. We monitored the progression of clinical signs of rabies and used immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to follow the spread of the virus from the infection site to the brain.

**Main Findings:** In contrast to i.m. infection, where both variants caused a lethal encephalopathy, only i.v. infection with SB resulted in the development of a lethal infection. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that only i.v. administered SB directly infected the forebrain, with the earliest affected regions being the hypothalamic nuclei, which are connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. qRT-PCR did not reveal major differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain at different times after i.m. or i.v. infection of SB.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has significant implications for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that certain RV variants, such as SB, can invade the CNS via hematogenous spread from the periphery. This finding highlights the importance of considering this alternative pathway in the development of post-exposure prophylaxis strategies, particularly for individuals exposed to silver-haired bat-associated RV. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying hematogenous spread of RV and to develop effective countermeasures.

    **Title:** Segmental Reassortment Drives the Evolution and Epidemiology of H1N1 Influenza A Virus

    **Research Question:** What is the role of segmental reassortment in the genomic evolution of H1N1 influenza A virus, particularly in relation to several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a dataset of 71 complete genome sequences of H1N1 influenza A viruses sampled between 1918 and 2006, representing 17 countries on five continents. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify reassortment events affecting specific segments of the genome.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that segmental reassortment has played a significant role in the genomic evolution of H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, we found that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. These findings suggest that intra-subtype reassortment is a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of segmental reassortment in the evolution of H1N1 influenza A virus, which has significant implications for our understanding of the epidemiology of this virus. The ability of H1N1 to undergo reassortment may contribute to its ability to evade the immune system and cause severe epidemics. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the 1947 and 1951 epidemics may have been caused by reassortant viruses, which has important implications for our understanding of the evolutionary history of H1N1.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genomic evolution of H1N1 influenza A virus and highlights the importance of segmental reassortment in shaping the epidemiology of this virus. Our findings have important implications for the development of influenza vaccines and our understanding of the evolutionary history of H1N1.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanisms of Nicotine-Induced Dopamine Release in the Ventral Tegmental Area: A Computational Modeling Approach

    Abstract:
    The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a critical dopaminergic structure involved in reward and motivation, as well as the acquisition of drug-reinforced behavior. Nicotine exerts its reinforcing action by stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and boosting dopamine (DA) output from the VTA. However, the principal pathway of nicotine action remains debated: direct stimulation of DAergic cells through nAChR activation or disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons. To shed light on this issue, we developed a novel computational model of the VTA circuitry and nAChR function. Our model illustrates that α4β2-containing nAChRs on either DA or GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. We account for both in vitro and in vivo data and predict the conditions necessary for either direct stimulation or disinhibition to be at the origin of DA activity increases. We propose key experiments to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms and show that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input crucially determines the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. Our results suggest that the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and propose an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement.

    Research Question:
    What is the principal pathway of nicotine action in the ventral tegmental area: direct stimulation of DAergic cells through nAChR activation or disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons?

    Methods:
    We developed a novel mesoscopic computational modeling approach extending a population activity representation of the VTA DA and GABA neurons to describe nAChR responses. This allowed us to clarify the interplay of the pharmacodynamics of nicotine and the dopaminergic signal constructed in the VTA.

    Main Findings:
    Our model shows that the endogenous cholinergic input rate has to be low for direct stimulation, whereas high cholinergic inputs are crucial in the disinhibition case, in order to observe a DA activity increase. These results emerge directly from known activation and desensitization properties of α4β2 nAChRs. We also show that the VTA model endowed with the description of the nAChR dynamics captures in vitro nicotine-evoked modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons.

    Implications:
    Our results suggest that the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and propose an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement. The rate of endogenous acetylcholine input plays a critical role in determining the evoked DA response for both direct stimulation and disinhibition mechanisms.

    Conclusions:
    Our computational model provides new insights into the mechanisms of nicotine-induced dopamine release in the VTA and sheds light on the debate surrounding the principal pathway of nicotine action. We propose key experiments to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms and suggest that the acetylcholine dependence hypothesis may be a critical factor in nicotine reinforcement.
Title: Accelerating Wound Closure and Preventing Superinfections in Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis with Bipolar High-Frequency Electrocauterization and Moist-Wound-Treatment with or without Sodium Chlorite (DAC N-055)

    Abstract:

    Background: Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania (L.) tropica infection is a chronic and disfiguring skin disease with limited therapeutic options. Superinfections and delayed wound closure are common complications.

    Research Question: Can bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with or without sodium chlorite (DAC N-055) accelerate wound closure and prevent superinfections in patients with CL?

    Methods: A two-armed, randomized, double-blinded, phase IIa trial was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan from 2004 to 2008. Patients with L. tropica CL were treated with EC followed by daily MWT with polyacrylate hydrogel with (group I) or without (group II) DAC N-055. Biopsies were taken prior to EC, after wound closure, and after 6 months.

    Main Findings: The mean duration for complete wound closure was 43.1 days in group I and 42 days in group II (p=0.83). DAC N-055 caused a more rapid wound epithelialization in patients with Leishmania-positive 2nd biopsies (37.2 days vs. 58.3 days; p=0.08). Superinfections occurred at the same rate in both groups (8.8%). Reulcerations were confined to cases with persistent high parasite loads after healing.

    Implications: The EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure compared to previous results with intralesional antimony injections. The tentatively lower rate of relapses and the acceleration of wound closure in a subgroup of patients with parasite persistence warrant future studies on the activity of DAC N-055.

    Conclusions: Bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization followed by moist-wound-treatment with or without sodium chlorite (DAC N-055) is a promising therapeutic approach for accelerating wound closure and preventing superinfections in patients with anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of RAS/MAPK Signaling: A Genome-Wide RNAi Screen Reveals Novel Factors Regulating MAPK Expression

    **Background:** The RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is a crucial conduit for transmitting proliferative signals in normal and cancer cells, with RAF-MEK-MAPK being a key module downstream of RAS. While several factors regulating RAS/MAPK signaling have been identified, the complexity of this pathway remains poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** What are the additional factors regulating RAS/MAPK signaling, particularly those acting downstream of MEK and influencing MAPK expression?

    **Methods:** We employed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most previously known factors associated with this pathway. Epistasis experiments were conducted to determine the position of individual candidates relative to core pathway components.

    **Main Findings:** The screen revealed several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway, including a novel protein complex modulating RAF activation. Notably, most hits unexpectedly work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. We further characterized two representative members of this group and found that they act by regulating MAPK alternative splicing.

    **Implications:** This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila. Our findings suggest that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, such as those controlling RAF activation, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Furthermore, our results indicate that core splicing components can specifically impact alternative splicing.

    **Conclusions:** This study expands our understanding of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and highlights the importance of splicing in regulating MAPK expression. The identification of novel factors acting downstream of MEK and influencing MAPK expression provides new insights into the complexity of this pathway. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of cancer biology and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway.
Title: Cryptococcosis in Thailand: A Retrospective Study of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii Isolates

    Abstract:

    Background: Cryptococcosis, a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, is a significant public health concern in Thailand. To better understand the epidemiology of cryptococcosis in Thailand, we conducted a retrospective study of 498 isolates of C. neoformans and C. gattii from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources.

    Methods: A total of 485 C. neoformans and 13 C. gattii strains were analyzed using URA5-RFLP, M13 PCR-fingerprinting, and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) to determine their molecular types and genetic diversity.

    Main Findings: The majority of the isolates (68.9%) were from males with a mean age of 37.97 years, and 88.5% of C. neoformans and 37.5% of C. gattii strains were from HIV patients. URA5-RFLP and M13 PCR-fingerprinting analysis revealed that the majority of the isolates (94.8%) were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their source. MLST analysis identified 20 sequence types (STs) in Thailand, with ST30 for C. gattii and ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173 for C. neoformans being unique to Thailand. The majority of C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype.

    Implications: Our study reveals a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. The findings suggest that Thailand may be a stepping stone in the global spread of the C. gattii outbreak strain. The study highlights the need for further research on the epidemiology and virulence of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex to improve disease management in Thailand.

    Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of cryptococcosis in Thailand, shedding light on the genetic diversity and molecular types of C. neoformans and C. gattii isolates. The findings have significant implications for the management of cryptococcosis in Thailand and highlight the need for continued research on the epidemiology and virulence of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex.

    **Title:** Transcription Factor Variation Contributes to Regulatory Divergence in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** To what extent do transcription factors (TFs) contribute to the evolution of regulatory networks in Drosophila species?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the evolution of Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, the largest class of metazoan TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years of evolution.

    **Main Findings:** We found that a significant fraction of C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. Specifically, ~44% of domains shared between D. melanogaster and other fly species show diverging DNA-contacting residues, which are conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These variations are rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D. melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Furthermore, proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains exhibit no functional enrichments.

    **Conclusions:** Our work challenges the assumption that 1-to-1 orthologous TFs are always highly conserved and provides evidence that binding specificity modifications in single-copy TFs may play an important role in the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of regulatory networks and highlight the importance of considering TF variation in the study of phenotypic variation across organisms.
Title: Development of CRISPR-based PCR Assays for Rapid and Accurate Detection of Salmonella enterica Serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A

    Abstract:

    Background: Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, respectively, are significant public health concerns worldwide. Traditional serotyping methods are often time-consuming and require typing sera, which may not be readily available. To address this issue, we developed serotype-specific PCR assays targeting CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) regions of the Salmonella genome.

    Research Question: Can CRISPR-based PCR assays be developed for the rapid and accurate detection of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A?

    Methods: We used a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRISPR, as a serotype-specific target to develop conventional multiplex PCR assays and EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR assays for the detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates.

    Main Findings: We achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol after validation of the assays on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 serotype Paratyphi A strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and time periods, as well as on 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 other Salmonella serotypes and 42 strains from 38 other bacterial species.

    Implications: The performance and convenience of our serotype-specific PCR assays should facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of these two major serotypes in a large range of clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. These assays can be used with DNA from cultured isolates, and with modifications, can be adapted for use with clinical and other samples.

    Conclusions: We demonstrate that CRISPR regions can be used as an original target for the development of PCR assays specific for particular Salmonella serotypes containing constant and unique spacers. Our CRISPR-based PCR assays offer a reliable and efficient tool for the detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, and can be used as an alternative to traditional serotyping methods in clinical and public health settings.

    **Title:** Notch Signaling Regulates IFNγ-Secreting CD4+ T Helper 1 Cell Differentiation in Response to Leishmania major Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Notch receptors in the differentiation of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells in response to Leishmania major infection?

    **Methods:** Mice with T cell-specific gene ablation of Notch1 (N1), Notch2 (N2), or both (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) were infected with Leishmania major, a protozoan parasite that induces a Th1 immune response in most strains of mice. The expression of Notch receptors on CD4+ T cells was measured by flow cytometry, and the secretion of IFNγ, IL-5, and IL-13 cytokines was analyzed by ELISA.

    **Main Findings:** Mice with ablation of both N1 and N2 (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia, whereas mice with single inactivation of N1 or N2 (N1ΔCD4Cre or N2ΔCD4Cre) were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 immune response. Notch signaling was required for the secretion of IFNγ by Th1 cells, and this effect was independent of CSL/RBP-Jκ, the major effector of Notch receptors.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate a crucial role for RBP-Jκ-independent Notch signaling in the differentiation of a functional Th1 immune response following Leishmania major infection. The persistence of parasites in the draining lymph nodes of N1N2ΔCD4Cre mice induced IL-13 and IL-5 secretion by T cells, suggesting that Notch signaling contributes to the generation of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T cells, which are essential for controlling parasite load and lesion size.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of Notch signaling in the differentiation of IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells in response to Leishmania major infection. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which Notch receptors regulate Th1 cell differentiation and the ligands involved in this process may contribute to the development of new vaccines and immunotherapeutic targets for Leishmania pathology and other infections requiring a protective IFNγ-secreting CD4+ Th1 immune response.

Title: Schistosoma mansoni Infection Enhances Susceptibility to Mucosal HIV-1 Transmission in Rhesus Macaques

Background: The disproportionate HIV-1 infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to helminthic parasite infections that affect many individuals in the developing world. However, the hypothesis that parasite infection increases an individual's susceptibility to HIV-1 has never been prospectively tested in a relevant in vivo model.

Objectives: To investigate whether pre-existing infection of rhesus monkeys with Schistosoma mansoni would facilitate systemic infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure.

Methods: Two groups of animals, one consisting of normal monkeys and the other harboring Schistosoma mansoni, were challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of R5-tropic clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C).

Results: Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts. The 50% animal infectious (AID50) SHIV-C dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls (P < 0.001). Coinfected animals also had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads than controls (P < 0.001), as well as increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells (P = 0.03).

Conclusion: Our data provide the first direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis significantly increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition. The magnitude of the effect suggests that control of helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1. These findings have profound public health implications for areas of the world where both parasitic worms and HIV-1 are endemic.

Implications: The increased susceptibility to mucosal immunodeficiency virus transmission observed in schistosome-infected macaques, elevated viral replication in coinfected hosts, and accelerated loss of memory T cells all support the suggestion that better control of helminth infections may favorably impact efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.

    **Title:** Acetylcholine-Regulated Neural Excitability and Network Structure Interact to Create Distinct Functional Regimes in Cortical Activity

    **Research Question:** How do changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create distinct functional regimes in cortical activity, and what role does acetylcholine (ACh) play in regulating these regimes?

    **Methods:** We developed a biophysical model of a neural network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons with a M-current regulated by ACh. We simulated changes in neural excitability and network structure to create three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that changes in ACh level can account for dynamical changes between functional regimes. Reduction of the magnitude of the M-current recreates the reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and the shift from a type 2 to a type 1 phase response curve (PRC) observed in the presence of ACh. We found that when SFA is minimal (in waking or REM sleep state, high ACh), patterns of activity are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. In contrast, when SFA is present (decreasing ACh), traveling waves of activity naturally arise. A further decrease in ACh leads to a high degree of synchrony within traveling waves.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that large-scale spatio-temporal dynamics can be induced by ACh-mediated SFA and that neural networks composed of highly excitable cells will be more responsive to synaptic heterogeneities. These findings may have a profound functional significance, as stationary patterns may play a role in the proper encoding of external input as memory, while traveling waves could lead to synaptic regularization.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that ACh-regulated neural excitability and network structure interact to create distinct functional regimes in cortical activity. The level of ACh determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity, and our results qualitatively match those observed experimentally. These findings provide new insights into the role and significance of ACh in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from these patterns.

    **Title:** Somatic Mutations in the Toll-like Receptor Pathway Disrupt Innate Immune Signaling and Promote Tumorigenesis in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma

    **Research Question:** Do somatic mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway contribute to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity?

    **Methods:** We interrogated whole-genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and matched germline controls to identify non-synonymous mutations affecting the TLR pathway. We also validated our findings in an external EAC dataset and in other solid tumor types exposed to microbiomes in the COSMIC database.

    **Main Findings:** We found that non-synonymous mutations collectively affected the TLR pathway in 25/171 (14.6%) EAC tumors, with TLR4 being the most frequently mutated gene. The TLR4 mutants E439G, S570I, F703C, and R787H were confirmed to have impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide with marked reductions in signaling by luciferase reporter assays.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC, and TLR4 mutations have decreased responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients. The association of TLR pathway mutations with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease indicates possible clinical significance of these mutations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that somatic mutations in the TLR pathway disrupt innate immune signaling and promote a microenvironment that favors tumorigenesis in EAC. The high frequency of TLR pathway mutations in solid tumors arising in body sites exposed to microbiota, including EAC, colorectal adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uterine endometrioid carcinoma, highlights the importance of the TLR pathway in cancer development. These findings have implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying EAC and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the TLR pathway.

    **Title:** Hes1 Regulates Taste Cell Differentiation in Developing Taste Buds

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism of taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel approach combining in silico and in vivo analyses to investigate the molecular regulation of taste system development in mice. We used computational analysis of the upstream regulatory regions of Taste Receptor Calcium Signaling Molecules (TRCSMs) to identify potential common regulatory factors. We then examined the role of Hes1, a transcription factor identified through this analysis, in vivo.

    **Main Findings:** Our in silico analysis revealed that Hes1 is a likely common regulatory factor for TRCSMs, which are involved in sweet, bitter, and umami taste signal transduction. We found that decreased expression of nuclear HES1 correlated with the expression of type II taste cell markers. Furthermore, we observed that the circumvallate papillae (CVP) of Hes1 knockout (Hes1−/−) mutants displayed over 5-fold more TRCSM-immunoreactive cells than those of their wild-type littermates. This suggests that Hes1 plays a crucial role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of taste cell development and differentiation. The identification of Hes1 as a common regulatory factor for TRCSMs highlights the importance of transcriptional regulation in the development of the taste system. These results have implications for understanding the ontogeny of taste cells and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for taste disorders.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that Hes1 is a key regulator of taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds. The combination of in silico and in vivo analyses allowed us to identify Hes1 as a common regulatory factor for TRCSMs, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of taste cell development. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the taste system and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for taste disorders.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Interaction between Ethylene and Auxin in Regulating Rice Root Elongation

    **Research Question:** How do ethylene and auxin interact to regulate root elongation in rice, and what is the role of YUC8/REIN7 in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice root elongation. We used an inhibitor of YUC activity to block auxin biosynthesis and identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus. We also overexpressed YUC8/REIN7 in rice to enhance ethylene sensitivity in the roots.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that YUC8/REIN7 is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. We found that ethylene induces YUC8/REIN7 expression and promotes auxin accumulation in roots. Furthermore, addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1 mutant, indicating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functions downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activates the expression of YUC8/REIN7.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating rice root elongation. We demonstrate that YUC8/REIN7 plays a crucial role in IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice. This study enhances our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice and provides a new model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that YUC8/REIN7 is essential for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice. We propose a model in which ethylene induces YUC8/REIN7 expression, which in turn promotes auxin biosynthesis and inhibits root elongation. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating rice root growth and development.
Title: Systematic Epidemiological Study of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) Diseases in Saudi Arabia: Emerging Trends and Public Health Implications

Abstract:

Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported to cause pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases globally, but the epidemiological situation in Saudi Arabia remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a nationwide systematic epidemiological study of NTM diseases in Saudi Arabia.

Research Question: What is the prevalence and diversity of NTM species causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases in Saudi Arabia, and what are the associated risk factors?

Methods: A nationwide collection of NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data was conducted over 24 months. Primary species identification was performed using line probe assays, followed by sequencing of 16S rRNA, 16S-23S ITS region, rpoB, and hsp65 genes. The laboratory findings were analyzed against demographical and clinical data.

Main Findings: A total of 527 isolates were enrolled, with a higher proportion of Saudi citizens (76.5%), elderly patients (>60 years) (34.2%), and male gender (65.3%). The majority of isolates (75.1%) were of pulmonary origin, with a proven clinical significance of 44.7%. Thirty-four NTM species, including 17 rare species, were identified, along with 8 ‘undefined’ isolates. M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuitum (18.1%), and M. abscessus (17.8%) were the predominant species. Notably, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M. riyadhense were identified.

Implications: The emergence of rare NTM species and M. riyadhense poses a significant challenge to public health in Saudi Arabia. Rare clinical events, such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis, and ascites, were caused by M. wolinskyi, M. holsaticum, M. duvalii, and M. monacence, respectively. Diabetes mellitus (P-value = 0.04) and previous history of tuberculosis (P-value = 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases.

Conclusions: The NTM disease spectrum and pathogen diversity in Saudi Arabia is an emerging challenge that requires immediate attention. Our study highlights the need for developing diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans to address the increasing prevalence of NTM diseases in the country. Further research is necessary to investigate the vulnerability of the Saudi population to NTM diseases and to develop a comprehensive management plan for mycobacterial disease control.

    **Title:** Molecular Determinants of Quiescence Entry and Lifespan Extension in Yeast

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular determinants that orchestrate quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast cells upon starvation for glucose or other macronutrients?

    **Methods:** We screened a subset of the yeast deletion library representing genes encoding ‘signaling’ proteins using starvation-specific gene reporters. We analyzed the chronological lifespan (CLS) of single, double, and triple mutants of RIM15, YAK1, and MCK1 kinases, as well as mutants of the SNF1/AMPK complex, cell wall integrity pathway, and cell cycle regulators.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that, apart from previously characterized Rim15, Mck1, and Yak1 kinases, the SNF1/AMPK complex, cell wall integrity pathway, and several cell cycle regulators are necessary for proper quiescence establishment and CLS extension. The CLS of these signaling mutants correlates well with the amount of storage carbohydrates, but poorly with transition-phase cell cycle status. We also found that the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species are cooperatively controlled by Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1, and that these kinases mediate the TOR1-regulated accumulation of storage carbohydrates and CLS extension.

    **Implications:** Our data support the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy stores and the activation of anti-oxidant defense systems are coordinated by Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1 kinases to ensure quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast. The accumulation of trehalose and glycogen is essential for CLS extension, and overexpression of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes, or addition of trehalose to the growth medium, rescues the defects of quiescence exit exhibited by the rim15Δyak1Δ and rim15Δmck1Δ mutants.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that the primary objective of the signaling pathways activated by glucose starvation is to reprogram carbon metabolism so that transition-phase cells can accumulate sufficient energy stores to power quiescence exit. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular determinants of quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast, and have implications for understanding the mechanisms of aging and longevity in eukaryotic cells.

    **Title:** Rapid Antigenic Evolution of Influenza A and B Viruses: Unveiling the Role of Hemagglutinin Glycosylation in Immune Evasion

    **Research Question:** How do influenza A and B viruses persist in human populations despite widespread herd immunity, and what viral mechanisms enable antigenic evolution?

    **Methods:** We employed the primerID method of error-correcting viral population sequencing to investigate the role of hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects resulting from escape from anti-HA neutralizing antibodies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that antibody-free propagation following antigenic escape rapidly selected viruses with mutations that modulated receptor binding avidity through the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain. This unexpected role of glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects highlights the immense power of high-definition virus population sequencing to reveal novel viral adaptive mechanisms.

    **Implications:** Our findings expand our understanding of the viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution to include glycan addition. This discovery sheds light on the unique mutational plasticity of influenza HA and underscores the critical function of glycosylation during antigenic drift. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable potential of highly accurate virus population sequencing and high-definition forward genetics for exploring viral evolution.

    **Conclusions:** The need to accumulate compensatory mutations to combine antigenic novelty with fitness and transmissibility has been proposed as an explanation for the discordance between high in vitro mutation rates and rapid Ab-based selection of influenza viruses in vivo. Our results indicate that glycosylation can play an important role in this process, compensating for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions elsewhere on HA. This raises the intriguing possibility that both mechanisms contribute to the steady evolutionary accretion of N-linked glycans within the globular domain observed during human circulation of H1 and H3 viruses. Our study demonstrates the power of virus population sequencing for uncovering novel mechanisms of viral adaptation through high-definition forward genetics screening.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Forward Rate Dependence in Antiarrhythmic Drugs: A Comprehensive Analysis of Ventricular Myocyte Models

    **Research Question:** Can forward rate dependence (FRD) be achieved in antiarrhythmic drugs, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We performed a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models, simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzing population results statistically. An average of 40 parameters were tested in each model, and effects on action potential (AP) duration were assessed at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis identified a variety of FRD ionic current perturbations and generated specific predictions regarding their mechanisms. We found that an increase in L-type calcium current is FRD when accompanied by indirect, rate-dependent changes in slow delayed rectifier potassium current. A comparison of predictions across models identified inward rectifier potassium current and the sodium-potassium pump as the two targets most likely to produce FRD AP prolongation. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of results from the 13 models demonstrated that models displaying minimal rate-dependent changes in AP shape have little capacity for FRD perturbations, whereas models with large shape changes have considerable FRD potential.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the determinants of AP duration rate dependence and illustrates a strategy for the design of potentially beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs. The findings suggest that FRD can be achieved through specific ionic current perturbations, and that the capacity for FRD prolongation depends on the extent to which the AP contour changes with rate.

    **Conclusions:** Our results challenge the idea that reverse rate dependence is an inherent property of ventricular myocytes and provide a framework for the design of antiarrhythmic drugs that exhibit forward rate dependence. By understanding the mechanisms underlying FRD, we can develop more effective treatments for arrhythmias and improve patient outcomes. Overall, this study contributes to the development of novel antiarrhythmic strategies and highlights the importance of considering the complex interactions between ionic currents in the design of antiarrhythmic drugs.

    **Title:** Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) of Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase (TPMT) Activity in Patients Treated with Thiopurine Drugs: A Novel Approach Using ICD-10 Codes and Biological Test Results

    **Research Question:** Can Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) using ICD-10 codes and biological test results identify novel associations between TPMT activity and clinical phenotypes in patients treated with thiopurine drugs?

    **Methods:** We developed new methods to perform PheWAS based on ICD-10 codes and biological test results, using a quantitative trait (TPMT activity) as the selection criterion. We applied these methods to 442 patient records from a French academic hospital, analyzing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. We used two aggregation methods for ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. We also employed discretization algorithms to analyze 11 biological test results.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with very high TPMT activity (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0015, respectively). Cross-validation with biological test results validated the ICD phenotypes. The results from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant.

    **Implications:** This study highlights the potential of PheWAS to identify new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management. By using a quantitative trait in the context of pharmacogenomics, we discovered new potential associations between TPMT-related to thiopurine treatment and clinical data.

    **Conclusions:** We describe an original method to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results. This approach allows for the identification of novel associations between TPMT activity and clinical phenotypes, which can inform personalized clinical and therapeutic management in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of PheWAS using ICD-10 codes and biological test results, and highlights the potential of this approach in the field of pharmacogenomics.
Title: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Stem Cell Therapies in Animal Models of Spinal Cord Injury

    Abstract:
    Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition with limited treatment options. Stem cells have shown promise in restoring neurological function, but the efficacy of stem cell therapies in animal models of SCI remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to investigate the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem cell treatments in animal models of SCI. Our analysis of 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations revealed that allogeneic stem cell treatment significantly improves both motor (effect size, 27.2%; 95% CI, 25.0-29.4%) and sensory (effect size, 26.3%; 95% CI, 7.9-44.7%) outcomes. However, facets of stem cell biology, such as differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery, had a significant impact on sensory outcomes. In contrast, motor outcomes were influenced by experimental modeling and outcome measures. Our findings suggest that stem cell implantation may not be effective in female animals and is enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. The presence of a dose-response relationship supports the biological plausibility of stem cell therapies. However, the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias likely underestimates the true efficacy of stem cell therapies. Our study highlights the need for rigorous experimental design and reporting to accurately assess the efficacy of stem cell therapies in animal models of SCI.

    Research Question:
    What is the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem cell treatments in animal models of spinal cord injury?

    Methods:
    We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations. Two investigators independently reviewed retrieved publications, and we included experiments where functional outcome in a group of animals exposed to traumatic spinal cord injury and treated with allogeneic or autologous stem cells was compared with functional outcome in a control group of animals.

    Main Findings:
    Our analysis revealed that allogeneic stem cell treatment significantly improves both motor (effect size, 27.2%; 95% CI, 25.0-29.4%) and sensory (effect size, 26.3%; 95% CI, 7.9-44.7%) outcomes. However, facets of stem cell biology, such as differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery, had a significant impact on sensory outcomes. In contrast, motor outcomes were influenced by experimental modeling and outcome measures.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that stem cell implantation may not be effective in female animals and is enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. The presence of a dose-response relationship supports the biological plausibility of stem cell therapies. However, the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias likely underestimates the true efficacy of stem cell therapies.

    Conclusions:
    Our study highlights the need for rigorous experimental design and reporting to accurately assess the efficacy of stem cell therapies in animal models of SCI. While our findings suggest that allogeneic stem cell treatment may be effective in improving motor and sensory outcomes, the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias must be considered when interpreting the results. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of stem cell therapies in treating SCI.
Title: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) Reinfection Patterns after Preventive Chemotherapy

    Abstract:
    Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, or repeated administration of anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the primary control strategy. However, this approach does not prevent reinfection. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment.

    Methods:
    We systematically searched multiple databases, including PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, to identify relevant studies. We extracted data on study year, country, sample size, age of participants, diagnostic method, drug administration strategy, prevalence and intensity of infection pre- and post-treatment, cure and egg reduction rate, evaluation period post-treatment, and adherence. We used pooled risk ratios from random-effects models to assess the risk of STH reinfection after treatment.

    Main Findings:
    Our analysis included 51 studies, with 24 providing STH infection rates pre- and post-treatment. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, A. lumbricoides prevalence reached 26% (95% CI: 16-43%), 68% (95% CI: 60-76%), and 94% (95% CI: 88-100%) of pretreatment levels, respectively. For T. trichiura, respective reinfection prevalence were 36% (95% CI: 28-47%), 67% (95% CI: 42-100%), and 82% (95% CI: 62-100%). Hookworm reinfection prevalence were 30% (95% CI: 26-34%), 55% (95% CI: 34-87%), and 57% (95% CI: 49-67%). Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. This highlights the need for frequent anthelmintic drug administrations to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation are necessary to interrupt transmission of STH.

    Conclusions:
    Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that STH reinfections are a significant public health concern, particularly in areas with high pretreatment infection rates. The rapidity of reinfection emphasizes the need for sustained and frequent anthelmintic treatment, as well as integrated control strategies that address the root causes of STH transmission.

    Title: Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA): A Novel Framework for Identifying Deregulated Metabolic Processes in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

    Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of metabolic syndromes, from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes, pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) and other algorithms have been employed. However, these approaches rely on predefined pathway maps, which are subject to biases associated with different pathway annotations and cannot capture the complex interactions of genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs).

    Research Question: Can a novel framework, Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA), be developed to identify deregulated metabolic processes in NAFLD by integrating condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples?

    Methods: MiNEA generates all possible alternative minimal networks (MiNs) composed of reactions pertaining to various metabolic subsystems that can synthesize a target metabolite. We applied MiNEA to investigate deregulated MiNs and identify key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and liver inflammation, in both humans and mice.

    Main Findings: MiNEA identified key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both humans and mice. Furthermore, we found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice. MiNEA also identified MiNs that demonstrate the general and specific characteristics of the different NAFLD phenotypes.

    Implications: MiNEA provides a novel framework for identifying deregulated metabolic processes in NAFLD, which can be applied to any GEM and target metabolite. This approach can be used to study condition-specific metabolism for any given disease or organism.

    Conclusions: MiNEA overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms by generating all possible MiNs and identifying key regulators of metabolic processes. Our results demonstrate the utility of MiNEA in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD phenotypes. This framework has the potential to be applied to other diseases and organisms, providing new insights into the complex interactions of metabolic networks.

    **Title:** Primacy Coding in the Olfactory System: A Robust and Efficient Representation of Odor Identity

    **Research Question:** How does primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest, provide a compact and informative representation of odors in the olfactory system?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a simple model of neural representations of olfactory stimuli, where odors are identified by the N strongest responding receptor types. We used numerical simulations and a statistical model to investigate the effects of primacy coding on the transmitted information and the discriminability of odors.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of the odor intensity, and the transmitted information is useful to perform typical olfactory tasks with close to experimentally measured performance. Interestingly, we find situations in which a smaller receptor repertoire is advantageous for discriminating odors. Our model also suggests that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the entire response and make the whole array useless, allowing us to predict how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes.

    **Implications:** Primacy coding provides a robust and compact representation of the odor identity over a wide range of odors, independent of the odor intensity. Our results suggest that the primacy code formed in the olfactory bulb is more useful to identify odors in the subsequent olfactory cortex than simple alternatives, essentially because the statistics of the representations are independent of the odor statistics. Our model predicts that receptors are only useful if their likelihood to respond to incoming odors is similar.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that primacy coding is a more efficient and useful odor representation than simple binary and normalized coding. The sparsity of the odor representations is independent of the odor statistics, making primacy coding an attractive solution for the olfactory system. Our results have implications for understanding how the olfactory system adapts to environmental changes and how receptor arrays need to be tuned to stay useful.

    **Title:** Incomplete Neutralization of HIV by Broadly Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies: A Widespread Phenomenon

    **Research Question:** To investigate the extent of non-sigmoidal slopes and plateaus at <100% for HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) targeting different regions of the HIV envelope (Env) spike.

    **Methods:** We used a 278-pseudovirus panel in a CD4 T-cell (U87.CCR5.CXCR4) assay and a 117-virus panel in the TZM-bl assay to evaluate the neutralization profiles of bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex, gp41, high-mannose patch, and CD4 binding site (CD4bs) epitopes. We also analyzed a large peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)-grown molecular virus clone panel derived from patient viral swarms and compared the neutralization profiles of five bnMAbs against an 18-virus panel of molecular clones produced in 293T cells and PBMCs.

    **Main Findings:** We found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex and gp41 were more likely to display non-sigmoidal slopes and plateaus at <100% neutralization, whereas bnMAbs targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to exhibit this behavior. Two CD4bs Abs also showed this behavior relatively infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was observed in both cell lines and primary cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are possible for all HIV bnMAbs against a wide range of viruses, which has implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and as tools for vaccine design.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are a widespread phenomenon for HIV bnMAbs targeting different regions of the Env spike. These findings highlight the complexity of HIV neutralization and underscore the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves. Further studies are necessary to establish how incomplete neutralization in pseudovirus assays relates to anti-viral activity of bnMAbs in vivo.

    **Title:** Metabolic Reprogramming in Cancer Cells: A Systematic Analysis of Glucose and Glutamine Utilization

    **Research Question:** What are the metabolic pathways used by cancer cells to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced energy and biomass production, and how do these pathways contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation?

    **Methods:** We performed systematic constraint-based simulations of a model of human central metabolism using a novel constraint-based approach. We sampled the feasible flux space to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We also experimentally assessed glutamine-induced metabolic changes in a K-ras transformed cell line.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations revealed that, in the limited subset of proliferating cells, most displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of glutamine, oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased, while the production of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. Standard Flux Balance Analysis indicated that this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production, requiring the activity of a branched TCA cycle, in which glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of lipids and proteins.

    **Implications:** Our findings offer new understanding of the logic of the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth. The competition between glucose and glutamine may play a determinant role in cancer cell growth, and the metabolic rewiring observed in our model cell line may occur in a variety of tumor cell lines.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a systematic analysis of the metabolic pathways used by cancer cells to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced energy and biomass production. The emergent phenotype observed in our simulations, characterized by the production of lactate from glutamine, is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production, and is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic reactions. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to target cancer metabolism.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Physiological Environment of the Cellular Prion Protein: A Quantitative Investigation of the PrPC Interactome

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular environment that hosts the conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to disease-associated isoforms in neuroblastoma cells?

    **Methods:** A quantitative investigation of the PrPC interactome was conducted in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. The study extended to Doppel (Prnd) and Shadoo (Sprn), two mammalian PrPC paralogs, to facilitate recognition of relevant interactors.

    **Main Findings:** The study established a similar physiological environment for the three prion protein family members in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting direct interactions amongst them. Multiple interactions between PrPC and the neural cell adhesion molecule, laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) were confirmed, reconciling previously separate findings. Validation experiments revealed that interactions of PrPC with PDIs may extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and play a hitherto unrecognized role in the accumulation of PrPSc.

    **Implications:** The findings suggest that members of the mammalian prion protein family may be embedded in specialized membrane domains characterized by an extended molecular network supporting functions in adhesion control, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion events. The study highlights the importance of biochemical interactions among the members of the mammalian prion protein family.

    **Conclusions:** This investigation provides new insights into the molecular environment that hosts the conformational conversion of PrPC to disease-associated isoforms. The data suggest that PrPC organizes its molecular environment on account of its ability to bind to adhesion molecules harboring immunoglobulin-like domains, which in turn recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. These findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of prion diseases and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    **Title:** IL-5 Production by Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) Contributes to Eosinophil Accumulation in the Lungs during Influenza Virus Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the cellular source and molecular basis of IL-5 production during respiratory virus infection, and how does it contribute to eosinophil accumulation in the lungs?

    **Methods:** We used a mouse model of influenza virus infection to investigate IL-5 production and eosinophil accumulation in the lungs. We analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue for IL-5 protein and gene expression, and identified the cellular source of IL-5 using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.

    **Main Findings:** We found a robust transient release of IL-5 into infected airways, accompanied by a significant and progressive accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase of infection. The cellular source of IL-5 was identified as group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) infiltrating the infected lungs. We also demonstrated that the enhanced capacity for IL-5 production by ILC2 during recovery is concomitant with the enhanced expression of the IL-33 receptor subunit, ST2, by ILC2. Furthermore, we showed that NKT cells and alveolar macrophages (AM) are endogenous sources of IL-33 that enhance IL-5 production from ILC2.

    **Implications:** Our results reveal that the interaction between ILC2 and IL-33-producing NKT and AM leads to abundant production of IL-5 by ILC2, contributing to the accumulation of eosinophils observed during the recovery phase of influenza infection. This study provides new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IL-5 production and eosinophil accumulation in the lungs during respiratory virus infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that IL-5 production by ILC2 plays a critical role in the recruitment and accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs during the recovery phase of influenza infection. This study highlights the importance of ILC2-IL-33-NKT/AM interactions in regulating IL-5 production and eosinophil accumulation, and has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of respiratory virus infections and asthma exacerbation.
Title: Invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Infections in Southern Vietnam: A Retrospective Analysis of Clinical and Microbiological Manifestations

    Abstract:
    Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly among children and HIV-infected adults. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of iNTS disease in Asia are poorly documented. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of iNTS infections in an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. We retrospectively analyzed clinical records of 102 iNTS patients and performed multi-locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing on all organisms. Our results show that 71% of patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, and 33% reported intravenous drug use. We identified S. Enteritidis (ST11) and S. Typhimurium (ST19, 34, and 1544) as the most common serovars, with S. Typhimurium being significantly more common in HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.003). Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than HIV-negative patients (p = 0.037). Notably, 28% of patients with a known outcome died, with HIV infection being a significant risk factor for death (p = 0.039). Our findings suggest that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam, with a high mortality rate, and that HIV infection is a major risk factor for both infection and death. These results highlight the need for continued surveillance, including sequence typing and whole-genome sequencing, to monitor for the emergence or introduction of multidrug-resistant strains or strains with enhanced virulence phenotypes.

    **Title:** Development of Artificial Neural Networks for Predicting Phage Structural Protein Sequences

    **Research Question:** Can Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) be trained to accurately predict phage structural protein sequences from amino acid frequencies and protein isoelectric points, enabling the identification of phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis?

    **Methods:** We designed and trained feed-forward, back-propagation neural networks to classify phage protein sequences based on amino acid percent compositions and protein isoelectric point (pI). We trained five voting networks to identify a broad spectrum of phage and viral structural proteins and two ensembles of 10 ANNs each to identify phage capsid or tail proteins.

    **Main Findings:** Our ANNs achieved high accuracy in classifying phage structural protein sequences, with an ensemble of five voting networks identifying a broad spectrum of phage and viral structural proteins with ∼80% accuracy. Additionally, two ensembles of 10 ANNs each showed high specificity in identifying phage capsid or tail proteins. We also experimentally validated the ANN predictions by examining several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that were predicted to be structural proteins by transmission electron microscopy, which revealed structures strongly resembling virion structures.

    **Implications:** The development of ANNs for predicting phage structural protein sequences has significant implications for the detection and diagnosis of disease, vaccine development, and understanding the physiological potential of any environment. Phages play critical roles in the survival and pathogenicity of their hosts, and better identification of viruses would aid in understanding the physiological impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of ANNs to identify phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis. These networks will be valuable when sequence is available but in vitro propagation of the phage may not be practical or possible. Our findings highlight the importance of developing computational tools that do not rely solely on sequence similarity for identifying structural components of viruses.

    **Title:** KSHV ORF20 Hijacks the Function of OASL to Enhance KSHV Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the role of KSHV ORF20 in the viral life cycle, and how does it interact with the cellular protein OASL?

    **Methods:** We used quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) to identify interacting partners of KSHV ORF20, a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization studies to confirm the interaction between ORF20 and OASL.

    **Main Findings:** We found that ORF20 interacts with OASL, an interferon-stimulated gene product with antiviral activity, and that this interaction is conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses. Both ORF20 and OASL copurify with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and associate with polysomes, but do not have a global effect on translation. We also found that ORF20 enhances RIG-I-induced expression of endogenous OASL in an IRF3-dependent but IFNAR-independent manner.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection. We show that OASL expression is induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV.219 cells, and that OASL enhances KSHV infection. However, during infection with a KSHV ORF20stop mutant, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity is lost.

    **Conclusions:** We have characterized the interaction of ORF20 with OASL and suggest that ORF20 hijacks the function of OASL to enhance KSHV infection. Our findings provide new insights into the role of ORF20 in the KSHV life cycle and highlight the complex interplay between viral and cellular proteins during gammaherpesvirus infections. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which ORF20 and OASL interact and how this interaction contributes to KSHV pathogenesis.
Title: Prevalence and Presentation of Lassa Virus Disease in Febrile Children with and without Convulsions in an Endemic Area of Nigeria

    Abstract:
    Background: Convulsions with fever in children are a common neurologic emergency in the tropics, and determining the contribution of endemic viral infections can be challenging. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria.

    Methods: This was a prospective study of consecutive febrile children aged ≥1 month–15 years admitted to the Children’s Emergency Room of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital over a period of 1 year. Febrile children with convulsions (Cases) were compared with those without convulsions (Controls). LVD was defined by the presence of a positive Lassa virus RT-PCR test.

    Main Findings: Of 913 admissions, 373 (40.9%) had fever, and 108/373 (29%) presented with convulsions. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI = 1.9%, 5.7%) in febrile admissions, 3/108 (2.8%) in Cases, and 10/265 (3.8%) in Controls (Odds Ratio (95% CI) of LVD in Cases versus Controls = 0.73 (0.2, 2.7)). Only vomiting (OR (95% CI) = 0.09 (0.01, 0.70)) and bleeding (OR (95% CI) = 39.56 (8.52, 183.7)) were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD.

    Implications: LVD is an important cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas, but it is not significantly associated with convulsions in febrile children. Its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation on presentation underscore the importance of a high index of suspicion in diagnosis. Screening of febrile children with undifferentiated fever in endemic areas for LVD could be an important medical and public health control measure.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in diagnosing LVD in febrile children in endemic areas, particularly in the absence of localizing signs of infection. The findings suggest that LVD is a significant contributor to undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas, and its diagnosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile convulsions.

    **Title:** KAI2-Mediated Signaling Regulates Drought Resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** What are the chemical and genetic factors that regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, and how do they interact with other signaling pathways to promote plant adaptation to water deficit?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses to investigate the role of KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), a proposed karrikin receptor, in regulating drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. We generated kai2 mutants and compared their responses to water deprivation with those of wild-type plants.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that kai2 mutants are hypersensitive to water deprivation, exhibiting increased rates of water loss, drought-induced cell membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability. We also found that kai2 plants have reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis during drought and are hyposensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening assays. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified genes associated with the observed physiological and biochemical changes.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence for crosstalk between ABA- and KAI2-dependent signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to drought. We also show that strigolactone receptor mutant d14 (DWARF14) contributes to plant drought adaptation, although not by affecting cuticle development. These results suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 and D14 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that KAI2-mediated signaling positively regulates drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana by controlling cell membrane stability, stomatal movement, cuticle development, and anthocyanin production. We propose a KAR/KL-KAI2-SCFMAX2 signaling cascade as a key regulator of plant drought adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of KAI2-dependent signaling in plant drought resistance and suggest new avenues for improving crop yields under drought conditions.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Insulin Signaling in Schistosoma japonicum: Implications for Vaccine Development against Zoonotic Schistosomiasis

    Abstract:
    Schistosoma japonicum is a parasitic flatworm that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans and animals worldwide. To investigate the importance of insulin signaling in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of adult S. japonicum, we focused on the insulin receptors (SjIRs) of S. japonicum. Using biolayer interferometry, we demonstrated that human insulin binds to the L1 subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2 (designated SjLD1 and SjLD2) produced in Drosophila S2 cells. We then employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown the expression of SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro, resulting in reduced transcription of downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake in SjIR-knockdown worms compared to luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and fecal egg production in S. japonicum-infected mice. These findings emphasize the potential of SjIRs as veterinary transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines.

    Research Question: What is the role of insulin signaling in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of adult S. japonicum?

    Methods: We used biolayer interferometry to demonstrate the binding of human insulin to recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2, and RNAi to knockdown the expression of SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro. We also conducted vaccine/challenge experiments in mice to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 as transmission-blocking vaccine candidates.

    Main Findings: Our results show that human insulin binds to the L1 subdomain of SjIR1 and SjIR2, and that RNAi knockdown of SjIRs reduces the transcription of downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. We also observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake in SjIR-knockdown worms. In vaccine/challenge experiments, recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and fecal egg production in S. japonicum-infected mice.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that insulin signaling plays a crucial role in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of adult S. japonicum. The SjIRs are potential targets for the development of veterinary transmission-blocking vaccines against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica.

    Conclusions: The evidence from protein binding assays, RNAi, and vaccine/challenge experiments supports the existence of an insulin signaling transduction system in adult S. japonicum. The insulin pathway in schistosomes is presumed to be activated by the binding between host insulin and the parasite IRs, regulating the transcription of downstream genes involved in glucose metabolism. Our results have significant implications for the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica.

    **Title:** Breaking the Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission Cycle: A Novel Vector Elimination Strategy Using Interspecific Hybridization and Wolbachia Infection

    **Research Question:** Can interspecific hybridization and Wolbachia infection be used to develop a bi-directionally incompatible strain of Aedes polynesiensis, the primary vector of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in the South Pacific, to eliminate LF transmission?

    **Methods:** We generated an Aedes polynesiensis strain (‘CP’ strain) through interspecific hybridization with Aedes riversi, resulting in a stable infection with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. We then tested the fertility and competitiveness of CP males in laboratory assays and introduced them into wild-type Aedes polynesiensis populations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild-type Aedes polynesiensis populations.

    **Implications:** The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using interspecific hybridization and Wolbachia infection to develop a novel vector elimination strategy for Aedes polynesiensis, the primary vector of LF in the South Pacific. This approach has the potential to supplement ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) efforts and provide a useful augmentative tool for blocking LF transmission.

    **Conclusions:** The inability of prior MDA efforts to eliminate LF transmission from some Pacific regions highlights the need for alternative strategies to control the primary vector, Aedes polynesiensis. Our results support the feasibility of a species-specific approach using bi-directionally incompatible males to induce sterility in Aedes polynesiensis females, resulting in vector population elimination. The geography of the South Pacific is ideal for this approach, and we encourage field tests of this strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts. This novel vector elimination strategy has the potential to be extended to other vector species, such as Culex spp. or other aedine LF vectors in the South Pacific.
Title: Estimating the Public Health Burden of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Urambo District, Tanzania: A Study of DALYs and Financial Costs

    Abstract:

    Background: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, is a vector-borne disease that is fatal if left untreated. In Tanzania, HAT is highly focalized and poses significant socio-economic and public health challenges in affected communities.

    Research Question: What is the public health burden of HAT in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs in a highly endemic area of Tanzania?

    Methods: This study utilized hospital records from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment of HAT at Kaliua Health Centre, Urambo District. Direct medical and indirect costs incurred by individual patients and the health services were calculated. DALYs were estimated using methods recommended by the Global Burden of Disease Project, assuming a 45% under-reporting rate specific to Tanzania.

    Main Findings: The estimated DALYs for HAT in Urambo District with and without age-weighting were 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI: 209.1-362.6), respectively. When under-reporting was included, the results were 622.5 (95% CI: 155.3-1098.9) and 978.9 (95% CI: 201.1-1870.8), respectively. The costs of treating 143 patients were estimated at US$ 15,514, with patients themselves paying US$ 3,673 and the health services US$ 11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients were estimated at US$ 9,781.

    Implications: This study highlights the significant burden of HAT on affected rural communities in Tanzania, emphasizing the need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to particular rural settings in countries like Tanzania, where infectious diseases are prevalent and often concentrated in certain locations.

    Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that HAT imposes a considerable burden on health care systems and communities in Urambo District, Tanzania. The estimated DALYs and financial costs underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to control and prevent the spread of HAT in this region. Furthermore, the study's results emphasize the importance of considering the socio-economic impact of diseases like HAT on households and communities, particularly in rural settings where resources are limited.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Biological Function of Ngly1 and ENGase in Mice: Implications for NGLY1-Deficiency

    **Research Question:** What is the precise biological function of the cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (Ngly1) and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Engase) in mice, and how do these enzymes contribute to the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency?

    **Methods:** We generated Ngly1-deficient mice (Ngly1−/−) in a C57BL/6 background and analyzed their embryonic lethality. We then crossed Ngly1−/− mice with an outbred mouse strain (ICR) to create a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background. We also generated Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice (Ngly1−/−;Engase−/−) in both C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 and ICR mixed backgrounds.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Ngly1−/− mice are embryonic lethal in a C57BL/6 background. However, the lethality was partially suppressed by the additional deletion of Engase or by changing the genetic background to a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background. Notably, Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice (C57BL/6 background) and Ngly1-deficient mice (C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background) exhibited severe phenotypes reminiscent of NGLY1-deficiency symptoms in human subjects.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the embryonic lethal phenotype of Ngly1−/− mice is mainly related to its deglycosylation-dependent function. The partial rescue of lethality by Engase deletion or genetic background change indicates that Engase may play a compensatory role in Ngly1-deficient mice. Furthermore, the accumulation of specific N-glycoproteins in Ngly1−/−;Engase−/− MEF cells suggests that these proteins may be linked to the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the biological function of Ngly1 and Engase in mice and highlights the potential of Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice as a valuable animal model for studying NGLY1-deficiency. The identification of specific N-glycoproteins that accumulate in Ngly1−/−;Engase−/− MEF cells may also reveal potential therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder.

    **Title:** Controlling Gene Expression Noise in Embryonic Development: Insights from the Hunchback Gene in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** How do spatial gradients of transcriptional regulators, such as Bicoid (Bcd), specify positional information in developing embryos, and how is gene expression noise controlled during this process?

    **Methods:** We used a stochastic model of the hunchback (hb) promoter in Drosophila to investigate the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics. We varied the number and strength of Bcd and Hb binding sites and fit model parameters to data from wild-type (WT) embryos, the self-regulation mutant hb14F, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the hb promoter.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that WT Hb output noise is predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations. We also found that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter, and their strengths, play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to the variation in Bcd binding site number across different fly species.

    **Implications:** Our study identifies particular ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise, including the importance of self-feedback, multiple regulatory sites, and cooperativity. These findings contribute to the general understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development.

    **Conclusions:** Our results suggest that the control of gene expression noise is a critical aspect of embryonic development, and that the details of promoter structure and expression dynamics play a key role in this process. The model we developed provides a framework for understanding how noise is controlled in spatial gene expression patterns, and can be applied to other genes involved in patterning events. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of considering the intrinsic noise of gene expression in understanding the reproducibility of developmental processes.

    **Title:** Quantifying Selection Against Neanderthal Ancestry in Modern Humans: A Genome-Wide Analysis

    **Research Question:** What is the strength and nature of selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, and how does it shape the genomic contribution of Neanderthals to our genomes?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel method to estimate the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We applied this method to recently published estimates of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans.

    **Main Findings:** Our results confirm that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. We found that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. These alleles were effectively neutral in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. We propose that the majority of these alleles imposed a heavy genetic load on early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids.

    **Implications:** Our study suggests that differences in effective population size may play a more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. The accumulation of weakly deleterious alleles in Neanderthals, which were purged after introgressing into the human population, has had a profound effect on patterning levels of Neanderthal introgression in our genomes.

    **Conclusions:** Our results enhance our understanding of how selection shaped the genomic contribution of Neanderthals to our genomes and shed light on the nature of Neanderthal-human hybridization. This study represents one of the first attempts to estimate the strength of genome-wide selection against introgression between populations, and our method can be extended to estimate the distribution of selective effects against Neanderthal alleles or to estimate parameters separately for various categories of sequence.
Title: Dissecting the Role of Sp1 and NF-κB Elements in Modulating HIV-1 Gene Expression and Proviral Latency

    Abstract:

    Background: The HIV-1 promoter within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) orchestrates various aspects of the viral life cycle, including gene expression, replication, and the establishment of a latent state. Stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression, amplified by the Tat positive feedback loop, can contribute to the formation of either a productive, transactivated state or an inactive state.

    Research Question: How do Sp1 and NF-κB elements in the HIV-1 LTR modulate stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression and contribute to the establishment and maintenance of proviral latency?

    Methods: We employed a model lentivirus variant with mutations introduced in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements and used flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, pharmacological perturbations, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate the functional differences in contributions of each site to viral gene regulation.

    Main Findings: Our results reveal that each Sp1 site stabilizes both the Bright and Off states, promoting noisy gene expression and reducing the regulation of histone acetylation and deacetylation. The NF-κB sites exhibit distinct properties, with κB site I serving a stronger activating role than κB site II. Furthermore, Sp1 site III plays a crucial role in the recruitment of both p300 and RelA to the promoter. Analysis of 362 clonal cell populations infected with the viral variants revealed that mutations in any of the Sp1 sites yield a 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifurcation compared to that of the wild-type promoter.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that each Sp1 and NF-κB site differentially contributes to the regulation of viral gene expression, and Sp1 sites functionally “dampen” transcriptional noise, thereby modulating the frequency and maintenance of this model of viral latency. These results may have biomedical implications for the treatment of HIV latency.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the power of quantitative, dynamic phenotyping of viral mutants for dissecting regulatory inputs into the viral promoter in a proviral model of HIV. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between Sp1 and NF-κB elements in modulating stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression and contributing to the establishment and maintenance of proviral latency.

    **Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Orthology Prediction Methods: A Systematic Analysis of Phylogenetic and Functional Consistency

    **Research Question:** Which orthology prediction methods perform best in terms of phylogenetic and functional consistency, and what are the implications of these findings for the field of comparative genomics?

    **Methods:** We collected and mapped the results of nine leading orthology projects and methods (COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA) and two standard methods (bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance). We systematically compared their predictions with respect to both phylogeny and function using six different tests, involving the mapping of millions of sequences, handling of hundreds of millions of predicted pairs of orthologs, and computation of tens of thousands of trees.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that OMA and Homologene perform best in phylogenetic analysis and functional analysis where high specificity is required. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage level, OrthoMCL outperforms Ensembl Compara, and to a lesser extent, Inparanoid. EggNOG provides the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories, but is not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses.

    **Implications:** Our study provides guidance for the broad community of orthology data users as to which database best suits their needs. It also introduces new methodology to verify orthology and sets performance standards for current and future approaches.

    **Conclusions:** Our systematic evaluation of orthology prediction methods highlights the importance of considering both phylogenetic and functional consistency in orthology prediction. The results of this study have significant implications for the field of comparative genomics, where accurate ortholog prediction is crucial for protein annotation, phylogenetic analysis, and other applications. By providing a comprehensive comparison of orthology prediction methods, this study sets a new standard for evaluating the performance of these methods and will inform the development of future approaches.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Kinome of Schistosoma Species and Identifying Novel Therapeutic Targets for Schistosomiasis

    **Research Question:** Can a computational drug repurposing pipeline, supported by phenotypic screening, be used to identify novel therapeutic targets and approved drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic helminth infections?

    **Methods:** We developed an innovative computational drug repurposing pipeline to identify protein kinases as potential targets for schistosomiasis. We elucidated the kinome of Schistosoma japonicum and updated the kinomes of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. We then compared these kinomes with the human kinome to identify potential targets of existing inhibitors unique to Schistosoma species.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed several protein kinases as interesting new biological targets for schistosomiasis, including previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib, as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, and dinaciclib. Additionally, we identified 22 novel targets, including CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, and MEK1. We also suggested the primary and secondary targets in Schistosoma of those approved drugs, allowing for the development of novel therapeutics against schistosomiasis.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the kinomes of all three major infective Schistosoma species and the human host, enabling the identification of kinase targets and existing and novel inhibitors that could be effective against all three human infective life stages of Schistosoma species. This approach has the potential to accelerate the development of new therapeutics against schistosomiasis, a disease where existing treatments are failing due to the emergence of resistance.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of computational drug repurposing and phenotypic screening in identifying novel therapeutic targets and approved drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis. The elucidation of the S. japonicum kinome completes the kinomes of all three major infective Schistosoma species of humans, providing a valuable resource for future research. Our findings highlight the potential of kinase inhibitors as a promising class of drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis and provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against this important yet neglected disease.

    **Title:** Coupled Folding and Binding Mechanism of the pKID Domain of CREB to the KIX Domain of CBP

    **Research Question:** How does the pKID domain of the transcription factor CREB fold and bind to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP?

    **Methods:** We employed a topology-based Gō-type model to simulate the folding and binding mechanism of the pKID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of CBP. The model was constructed from the native structure of the pKID:KIX complex, as determined by NMR. We analyzed the binding mechanism quantitatively by identifying the key features of binding transition states using a Bayesian formula relating the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, where the pKID domain becomes structured only after committing to binding. The binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, suggesting that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This is in contrast to models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. Interestingly, increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a “fly-casting”-like process. We also found that the inclusion of attractive non-native interactions results in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism.

    **Implications:** Our study helps explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition. The results suggest that the pKID domain of CREB undergoes a structural change upon binding to the KIX domain of CBP, which is reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism. This is in agreement with a recently reported NMR study, and aids in the interpretation of the experimental binding kinetics.

    **Conclusions:** Our simulations provide new insights into the coupled folding and binding mechanism of the pKID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of CBP. The results suggest that the pKID domain becomes structured only after committing to binding, and that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution. This study contributes to our understanding of how proteins recognize and bind to their targets, and has implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for protein-protein interactions.
Title: Systematic Review of Schistosoma mansoni Infection Prevalence and Intensity in Children in Latin America and the Caribbean: Implications for Elimination Programs

    Abstract:

    Background: The World Health Assembly's 2012 resolution WHA65.21 called for increased investment in schistosomiasis control and support for countries to initiate elimination programs. This systematic review aimed to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries and territories.

    Methods: A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection was conducted by searching PubMed, LILACS, and EMBASE. Experts on the topic were consulted, and institutional web pages were reviewed (PAHO/WHO, Ministries of Health). A total of 132 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria, providing 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points.

    Main Findings: The majority of the studies were from Brazil (69.7%), which showed several 'hot spots' with high prevalence. Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update their epidemiological status to redesign their national programs and target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but compilation of an elimination dossier and follow-up surveys are needed to verify this status.

    Implications: The study highlights the need for updating the schistosomiasis status in historically endemic countries and territories in LAC to address required public health interventions for control and elimination programs or to verify the elimination of transmission of Schistosoma mansoni. Improved reporting and standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies are recommended, using available WHO guidelines. Meeting a regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex.

    Conclusions: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of Schistosoma mansoni infection prevalence and intensity in children in LAC countries and territories. The findings emphasize the importance of updating the epidemiological status of schistosomiasis in historically endemic areas to ensure effective control and elimination programs. The study highlights the need for improved reporting and standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies to achieve the regional elimination goal by 2020.

    **Title:** Genetic and Phenotypic Characterization of Transmitted/Founder HIV-1 Variants in Heterosexual Transmission Pairs

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of transmitted/founder (TF) HIV-1 variants in heterosexual transmission pairs, and how do they compare to non-transmitted (NT) variants from the same transmission pairs?

    **Methods:** We sequenced 167 near full-length HIV-1 genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IMC) from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs near the time of transmission. These IMC included TF variants and multiple NT HIV-1 subtype C variants. We assessed viral characteristics influencing HIV-1 transmission, including particle infectivity, viral replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC), and resistance to interferon-α (IFN-α).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in PBMC and MDDC compared to NT variants from the same transmission pairs. Additionally, resistance of TF variants to the antiviral effects of IFN-α was not significantly different from that of NT variants. These findings suggest that neither in vitro viral replicative capacity nor IFN-α resistance discriminated the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of these chronically infected individuals.

    **Implications:** Our study supports the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of HIV-1 transmission and the development of new targets for intervention.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides novel insights into the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of TF HIV-1 variants in heterosexual transmission pairs. The results suggest that factors other than IFN-α resistance constitute the dominant determinants of transmission fitness in these pairs. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 transmission and to identify new targets for intervention.
Title: Filarial Parasites Directly Induce Lymphangiogenesis and Lymphatic Differentiation in Human Lymphatic Endothelial Cells

    Abstract:

    Background: Lymphatic filariasis, caused by filarial parasites, leads to severe lymphedema and elephantiasis in humans. However, the mechanisms underlying these pathologies are not fully understood, particularly in the absence of an adaptive immune response.

    Research Question: How do filarial parasites and their antigens influence the lymphatics directly, leading to lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic dysfunction?

    Methods: Human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or serum from infected patients to investigate the effects on LEC proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression.

    Main Findings: Live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from patently infected patients and those with longstanding chronic lymphatic obstruction induced increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Gene expression analysis revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization, development, and junction adherence pathways, leading to decreased trans-endothelial transport.

    Implications: These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying lymphatic filariasis pathology.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that filarial parasites stimulate LEC to undergo proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures, involving matrix metalloproteases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. These findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of lymphatic filariasis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat this debilitating disease.

    Title: Single-Cell Genome Amplification and Sequencing using Microfluidic Devices and Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA)

    Research Question: Can microfluidic devices be used to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify their genomic DNA using Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) in nanoliter volumes, reducing nonspecific synthesis and amplification bias?

    Methods: We used a microfluidic device to isolate individual E. coli cells and amplify their genomic DNA by MDA in 60-nl reactions. The quality of the genome amplification was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and compared to single-cell amplifications performed in standard 50-μl volumes.

    Main Findings: Our results confirm that reduced MDA reaction volume lowers nonspecific synthesis, which can result from contaminant DNA templates and unfavourable primer interactions. The quality of the genome amplification was comparable to single-cell amplifications performed in standard 50-μl volumes. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanoliter volumes, providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microliter and nanoliter volumes provided high-quality sequence data by high-throughput pyrosequencing.

    Implications: This study demonstrates a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells using microfluidic devices and MDA in nanoliter volumes. This approach has significant implications for the study of microbial ecology and evolution, as it allows for the recovery of whole genome sequences from single cells that cannot be obtained in pure culture.

    Conclusions: Our results show that microfluidic devices can be used to isolate individual E. coli cells and amplify their genomic DNA using MDA in nanoliter volumes, reducing nonspecific synthesis and amplification bias. This approach provides a powerful tool for single-cell sequencing applications, enabling the study of microbial ecology and evolution at the single-cell level. The combination of MDA and emulsion PCR sample preparation may also improve specificity, making it a particularly powerful approach for single-cell sequencing applications. The assembly process also greatly improved specificity for E. coli sequence, with over 99% of the contigs mapping to the reference genome.

    **Title:** Spatial and Land Use Change Influences on Hantavirus Host Proportions in the Atlantic Forest Rodent Community

    **Research Question:** How do landscape structure and land use change influence the proportions of hantavirus hosts in the Atlantic Forest rodent community, and what are the implications for human disease vulnerability?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 283 Atlantic Forest rodent capture records and used geographically weighted models to test the effects of landscape diversity, habitat type, agricultural matrix, and defaunation intensity on hantavirus host proportions. We also assessed the correspondence between hantavirus host proportions and a human vulnerability to hantavirus infection index across the entire Atlantic Forest biome.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that hantavirus host proportions are more positively influenced by landscape diversity than by a particular habitat or agricultural matrix type. Local small mammal diversity also positively influences known pathogenic hantavirus host proportions, indicating that plasticity to habitat quality may be more important for these hosts than competition with native forest-dwelling species. We found a consistent positive effect of sugarcane and tree plantation on the proportion of rodent hosts, whereas defaunation intensity did not correlate with the proportion of hosts of potentially pathogenic hantavirus genotypes in the community.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that disease surveillance must be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the biome where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match. Moreover, our results indicate that non-defaunated areas can also be hotspots for hantavirus disease outbreaks. The spatial match between host hotspots and human disease vulnerability was 17%, while coldspots matched 20%.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals strong spatial and land use change influences on hantavirus hosts at the landscape level across the Atlantic Forest. These findings suggest that there may be more complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease than currently hypothesized. Our results highlight the importance of considering landscape diversity and local small mammal diversity when predicting hantavirus host proportions and human disease vulnerability.
Title: BCL2 Family Proteins Regulate Mitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis in Flavivirus-Infected Cells: Implications for Antiviral Therapy

    Abstract:
    The BCL2 family of proteins plays a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis by regulating mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the roles of BCL2 proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells infected with flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Our results show that BCLXL, a pro-survival BCL2 protein, suppresses the expression of MCL1, another pro-survival protein, thereby delaying apoptosis in infected cells. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors or deficient BCLXL gene expression induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in flavivirus-infected cells. Furthermore, we found that flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, leading to a reduction in short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. In vivo, haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene or administration of BH3 mimetic compounds increased survival rates after JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. These findings suggest that BCLXL plays a critical role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress the propagation of Flaviviridae viruses.

    Methods:
    We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the roles of BCL2 proteins in flavivirus-infected cells. We infected human and murine cell lines with JEV, DENV, and ZIKV and examined the expression levels of BCLXL and MCL1. We also treated cells with BCLXL inhibitors and deficient BCLXL gene expression to induce apoptosis in infected cells. In vivo, we used a mouse model of JEV infection to examine the effects of BCLXL haploinsufficiency and BH3 mimetic compounds on survival rates and inflammation.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that BCLXL suppresses the expression of MCL1, delaying apoptosis in flavivirus-infected cells. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors or deficient BCLXL gene expression induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in infected cells. We also found that flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, leading to a reduction in short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that BCLXL plays a critical role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress the propagation of Flaviviridae viruses. Inhibition of BCLXL may enhance cell death in virus-infected cells, reducing viral dissemination and inflammation.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BCLXL is a critical cell survival factor during infection with flaviviruses, and that inhibition of BCLXL by treatment with BH3 mimetics restricts the production of infectious particles in vitro and in vivo. These findings have important implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting BCL2 family proteins.
Title: Estimating the Economic Burden of Canine Rabies in Viet Nam: A 10-Year Analysis (2005-2014)

    Abstract:

    Background: Canine rabies is a significant public health concern in Viet Nam, with high levels of human deaths and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administration, but low investment in preventative dog vaccination. This study aimed to estimate the economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam from a societal perspective, including direct and indirect costs of rabies in dogs, livestock, and humans.

    Methods: We conducted a 10-year analysis (2005-2014) using data from personal interviews, published literature, reports, and primary data collection. We estimated the direct and indirect costs of PEP, dog vaccination efforts, livestock losses, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).

    Main Findings: The total economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam over the 10-year period was estimated to be over $719 million USD, with PEP-related costs accounting for 92% of the burden. Canine rabies created between 36,560 and 45,700 DALYs, measured in years of life lost (YLL). A total of 914 human deaths were reported over the study period, with a mortality rate of 0.11 deaths per 100,000 people.

    Implications: Our results indicate that canine rabies impacts in Viet Nam are consistent with those reported in other Asian countries, with large expenditures on PEP and minimal investments in dog vaccination. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD. These findings suggest that coordinated veterinary public health campaigns that prevent human rabies through dog vaccination are the most cost-effective control measure.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the significant economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam and underscores the need for increased investment in dog vaccination programs to prevent human rabies. By prioritizing dog vaccination over PEP administration, Viet Nam can reduce the economic burden of canine rabies and improve public health outcomes.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Characterization of the Vibrio-type Type II Secretion System (T2SS) Pilotin AspS

    **Background:** The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) is a molecular machine responsible for the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. A key component of the T2SS is the secretin, a multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. Recent studies have identified three distinct forms of T2SSs based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores.

    **Research Question:** What are the structural and functional characteristics of the Vibrio-type T2SS pilotin AspS, and how does it contribute to the assembly and function of the T2SS?

    **Methods:** We performed a comparative analysis of the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type T2SSs, focusing on the secretin and pilotin components. We determined the crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae using X-ray crystallography. We also conducted biochemical assays to investigate the interaction between AspS and the Vibrio-type secretin.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the Vibrio-type T2SS is distinguished from the Klebsiella-type T2SS by the presence of the pilotin AspS. The crystal structure of AspS reveals a unique fold that is structurally unrelated to the PulS-OutS family of proteins. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretin, enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly. We also found that homologs of AspS are present in all species of Vibrio, as well as in some strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the Vibrio-type T2SS has evolved convergently with the Klebsiella-type T2SS, with AspS playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of the T2SS. The presence of AspS in diverse bacteria suggests that it may be a key component of the T2SS in these organisms.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the structural and functional characteristics of the Vibrio-type T2SS pilotin AspS. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution and diversity of T2SSs in bacteria, and highlight the importance of AspS in the assembly and function of the T2SS.
Title: Identification of OmpL37 as a Novel Elastin-Binding Protein of Pathogenic Leptospira: Implications for Leptospirosis Pathogenesis

    Abstract:
    Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is transmitted to susceptible hosts through skin abrasions or mucous membranes. The ability of Leptospira to adhere to host tissue components is a crucial step in the infection process. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of three transmembrane outer membrane proteins, OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47, recently identified on the Leptospira surface. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the capacity of these proteins to bind to host tissue components. Our results show that OmpL37 binds to elastin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin with high affinity. Notably, OmpL37 exhibits dose-dependent, saturating binding to human skin elastin, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 104±19 nM. We also demonstrate that OmpL37 is recognized by acute and convalescent leptospirosis patient sera and Leptospira-infected hamster sera. Furthermore, OmpL37 protein is detected in pathogenic Leptospira serovars but not in saprophytic Leptospira. These findings suggest that OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may promote attachment of Leptospira to host tissues. Our results have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of leptospirosis and may lead to the development of diagnostic and protective antigens for this disease.

    Research Question:
    What are the functional roles of OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47 in binding to host tissue components, and how do these proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of leptospirosis?

    Methods:
    We used ELISA to determine the capacity of OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47 to bind to host tissue components, including elastin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. We also examined the reactivity of sera from L. interrogans L1-130-infected hamsters and leptospirosis patients to recombinant OmpL37 by immunoblot.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that OmpL37 binds to elastin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin with high affinity. OmpL37 exhibits dose-dependent, saturating binding to human skin elastin, with a Kd of 104±19 nM. We also demonstrate that OmpL37 is recognized by acute and convalescent leptospirosis patient sera and Leptospira-infected hamster sera. Furthermore, OmpL37 protein is detected in pathogenic Leptospira serovars but not in saprophytic Leptospira.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may promote attachment of Leptospira to host tissues. This has significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of leptospirosis and may lead to the development of diagnostic and protective antigens for this disease.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study identifies OmpL37 as a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism and functional role of OmpL37 in the infection process.
Title: **Mathematical Modeling of HIV-1 Neutralization by Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies**

    **Abstract:**

    **Background:** Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, such as 4E10 and 2F5, recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41, which are transiently exposed during viral entry. These polyreactive antibodies bind to the viral membrane and their epitopes, inducing a conformational change that results in a stably bound complex.

    **Research Question:** What is the probability that a bound antibody will disable a trivalent gp41 before fusion is complete, and what are the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to neutralize HIV-1?

    **Methods:** We developed a mathematical model to calculate, for any antibody concentration, the probability that a bound antibody will disable a trivalent gp41 before fusion is complete. We used this model to investigate the role of avidity in neutralization and the dependencies of neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridges between the virus and target cell.

    **Main Findings:** Our model predicts that for 4E10 and 2F5 to be effective at neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in the long-lived conformation, about five minutes or less. We found that 2F5 IgG, but not 4E10, is more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, attributed to 2F5 interacting more stably with the viral membrane. Analysis of neutralization experiments indicates that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the exact number cannot be determined from neutralization experiments alone.

    **Implications:** Our model provides a framework for understanding the mechanisms of HIV-1 neutralization by broadly neutralizing antibodies and highlights the importance of avidity in neutralization. The extended model predicts the dependencies of neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridges between the virus and target cell.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 neutralization by broadly neutralizing antibodies and sheds light on the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to neutralize HIV-1. The mathematical model developed in this study can be used to analyze neutralization data and provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between HIV-1 and broadly neutralizing antibodies.
Title: Long-term Efficacy of Mass Ivermectin Treatment in Eliminating Onchocerciasis in Endemic Foci in Africa: A 5-Year Follow-up Study

    Abstract:

    Background: Onchocerciasis, caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, is a significant public health problem in Africa. Mass treatment with ivermectin has been effective in controlling the disease, but its ability to interrupt transmission and eliminate the parasite in highly endemic areas was unknown.

    Research Question: Can long-term mass treatment with ivermectin eliminate onchocerciasis infection and transmission in highly endemic foci in Africa?

    Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperendemic foci in Mali and Senegal, where 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment was administered. Skin snip surveys were performed in 131 villages, examining 29,753 individuals and 492,600 blackflies for the presence of O. volvulus larvae using a specific DNA probe.

    Main Findings: A declining trend in infection and transmission levels was observed after the last treatment. In two sites, the prevalence of microfilariae and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were high before stopping treatment, a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels was observed 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. All infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination.

    Implications: The study demonstrates the feasibility of onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment in at least some endemic foci in Africa. The results support the evolution from onchocerciasis control to elimination in Africa.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that long-term mass treatment with ivermectin can eliminate onchocerciasis infection and transmission in highly endemic areas. The findings have significant implications for onchocerciasis control programs in Africa, where nearly all endemic areas are now under annual ivermectin treatment. The study's methodology and results provide a framework for future decision-making on stopping ivermectin treatment in areas that have reached the elimination threshold.

    **Title:** Molecular Mechanism of Human Rhinovirus VP4-Mediated Membrane Permeability

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism by which human rhinovirus (HRV) VP4 induces membrane permeability during cell entry?

    **Methods:** Recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged HRV VP4 was produced and its ability to induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes was investigated using dextran size-exclusion studies, chemical crosslinking, and electron microscopy.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that recombinant VP4 forms a multimeric, size-selective membrane pore with dimensions consistent with the transport of single-stranded RNA genome. The membrane permeability induced by VP4 was influenced by pH and was comparable to that induced by infectious virions.

    **Implications:** These findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP4 in cell entry and suggest that VP4 could be a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family, which includes significant pathogens such as poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that VP4, a small myristoylated capsid protein, plays a crucial role in the delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. The formation of a multimeric membrane pore by VP4 allows for the transfer of the single-stranded RNA genome across the cell membrane. These findings have significant implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting VP4, which could potentially inhibit the entry of picornaviruses into host cells.

    **Significance:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of picornavirus cell entry and highlights the potential of VP4 as a novel antiviral target. The development of antiviral therapies targeting VP4 could provide a new approach for the treatment of diseases caused by picornaviruses, such as the common cold, polio, and foot-and-mouth disease.

    Title: Carbohydrate Modifications of Francisella tularensis Lipid A Contribute to Bacterial Attenuation and Induction of Protective Immunity

    Background: Francisella tularensis (Ft) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease designated as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human clinical isolates of Ft produce lipid A of similar structure to Ft subspecies novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice.

    Research Question: What is the role of carbohydrate modifications of Francisella tularensis lipid A in bacterial virulence and protective immunity?

    Methods: We identified three enzymes required for Fn lipid A carbohydrate modifications: flmF1 (mannose), flmF2 (galactosamine), and flmK (galactosamine/mannose). We generated mutants lacking either galactosamine (flmF2) or galactosamine/mannose (flmK) addition to their lipid A and tested their virulence in mice.

    Main Findings: Mutants lacking galactosamine (flmF2) or galactosamine/mannose (flmK) addition to their lipid A were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of the mutants (flmF2 and flmK) provided protection against challenge with wild-type (WT) Fn, whereas subcutaneous administration of only the flmK mutant provided protection from challenge with WT Fn. Infection of an alveolar macrophage cell line by the flmK mutant induced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) compared to infection with WT Fn.

    Implications: Our results suggest that carbohydrate modifications of Francisella tularensis lipid A play an important role in bacterial virulence and protective immunity. The ability of the flmK mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and innate immune responses mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway may be responsible for its attenuation, leading to the induction of protective immunity by this mutant.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of carbohydrate modifications of Francisella tularensis lipid A in bacterial virulence and protective immunity. These findings may aid in the development of an effective Francisella vaccine in the future. The conserved function of these enzymes among Francisella subspecies suggests that inactivation of the flmK gene in other subspecies may also result in bacterial attenuation and activation of adaptive immunity.

    **Title:** Era, a Ribosome-Associated GTPase, Plays a Crucial Role in 30S Ribosomal Subunit Assembly and rRNA Processing in Staphylococcus aureus

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Era, a ribosome-associated GTPase, in ribosome assembly and rRNA processing in Staphylococcus aureus?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the function of Era in S. aureus. We used protein interaction studies to identify Era's binding partners, including the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA. We also generated deletion strains in the S. aureus MRSA strain LAC* to examine the importance of Era and CshA in growth and rRNA processing.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Era is not essential for the growth of S. aureus, but is crucial for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. We found that Era interacts with YbeY and CshA, and that both Era and CshA are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. We also demonstrated that Era and CshA form direct interactions with the (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase RelSau, with RelSau positively impacting the GTPase activity of Era but negatively affecting the helicase activity of CshA.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Era acts as a hub protein on the 30S ribosome, directing enzymes involved in rRNA processing/degradation and ribosome subunit assembly to their site of action. This activity is impeded by multiple components of the stringent response, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype synonymous with this stress response pathway.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals that Era plays a crucial role in 30S ribosomal subunit assembly and rRNA processing in S. aureus, and that its activity is regulated by interactions with YbeY, CshA, and RelSau. These findings provide new insights into the complex dynamics of ribosome assembly and the stringent response, and highlight the importance of Era as a key regulator of ribosome biogenesis in S. aureus.

    **Title:** Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Deficiency Exacerbates Anthrax Lethal Toxin (LT)-Mediated Cardiac Damage in Mice

    **Research Question:** What is the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the pathogenesis of anthrax lethal toxin (LT)-mediated cardiac damage in mice?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of LT on mice deficient in nNOS (nNOS−/−), endothelial NOS (eNOS−/−), and inducible NOS (iNOS−/−) using histopathological, biochemical, and echocardiographic analyses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that nNOS−/− mice are strikingly more sensitive to LT than wild-type (WT) mice, while eNOS−/− and iNOS−/− mice exhibit no increased sensitivity. Histopathological analyses revealed that LT induces architectural changes in the hearts of nNOS−/− mice, including novel inter-fiber spaces and endothelial/capillary necrosis. Electron microscopy revealed severe pathological changes in both nNOS−/− and WT mice, including myofilament and mitochondrial degeneration. Biomarkers of cardiac injury, such as myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein, were elevated in both nNOS−/− and WT mice following LT treatment. Echocardiography showed a significant reduction in ejection fraction in both nNOS−/− and WT mice.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that nNOS plays a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage. The increased sensitivity of nNOS−/− mice to LT is independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses.

    **Conclusions:** We report the heart as an early target of LT in mice and demonstrate that nNOS deficiency exacerbates LT-mediated cardiac damage. Our results highlight the importance of nNOS in protecting against LT-induced cardiac injury and suggest that nNOS may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of anthrax infection.

    **Research Question:** Can CRISPR-Cas9 be used to introduce targeted gene disruptions in parasitic nematodes, enabling the study of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites?

    **Methods:** We developed a method for introducing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruptions in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis and the rat-parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti. We delivered CRISPR-Cas9 constructs targeting the twitchin gene unc-22 into free-living adults of S. stercoralis and characterized Ss-unc-22 mutations in iL3 progeny. We also tested CRISPR-Cas9 activity in S. ratti using the same method.

    **Main Findings:** We successfully disrupted the S. stercoralis twitchin gene unc-22, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. Ss-unc-22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair (HDR) when a repair template was provided. Omission of a repair template resulted in deletions at the target locus. Ss-unc-22 mutations were heritable, and we passed Ss-unc-22 mutants through a host and successfully recovered mutant progeny. We also disrupted the unc-22 gene of S. ratti using a similar approach.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate the applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 to parasitic nematodes, enabling future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites. This breakthrough has significant implications for understanding the biology of parasitic nematodes, which infect over 1 billion people worldwide and cause some of the most common neglected tropical diseases.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed the first practical method for targeted gene disruptions in parasitic nematodes using CRISPR-Cas9. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and heritability of CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations in S. stercoralis and S. ratti, two important laboratory models for skin-penetrating parasitic nematode infections. This achievement opens up new avenues for studying the biology of parasitic nematodes and has the potential to accelerate the development of new treatments for parasitic nematode infections.

    **Title:** Mathematical Modeling of Ribosome Drop-Off Effects on Translational Efficiency and Ribosome Density Profiles

    **Research Question:** How does ribosome drop-off influence translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses during protein translation, and what are the mRNA-specific effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rates and ribosome density profiles?

    **Methods:** We developed a mathematical model to describe the effects of ribosome drop-off on ribosome density along the mRNA and concomitant protein synthesis rate. The model predicts that ribosome premature termination can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles and that the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rates are mRNA-specific.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mRNAs with ribosome queues are less affected by ribosome drop-off than those without ribosome queues. Furthermore, among mRNAs without ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, suggesting that sequences using fast codons are less affected by ribosome drop-off. A genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery, which are highly codon-biased and use preferentially fast codons, are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off.

    **Implications:** Our model provides a framework for analyzing variations in translational efficiency of individual mRNAs by accounting for the full range of known ribosome behaviors. The model also explains mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies. Importantly, the model predicts that the translation rates of mRNAs able to sustain ribosome queues are less affected by ribosome drop-off than those mRNAs that cannot present ribosome queues.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering ribosome drop-off in modeling and interpreting ribosome profiling data. The model provides a tool to address open problems in translation, such as the anti-correlation between ribosome density and mRNA length, and the effects of high-level recombinant protein production on ribosome drop-off. Our results suggest that resilience to ribosome drop-off might play an important role in gene regulation, particularly under stress conditions. Future studies will focus on analyzing ribosome profiling data at the single gene level and comparing ribosome density profiles with model predictions.

    Title: Evaluating the Feasibility of Transmission Interruption of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infections through Mass Drug Administration: A Simulation Study

    Background: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm (Necator americanus), remain a significant public health concern in many low- and middle-income countries. The current World Health Organization (WHO) strategy focuses on morbidity control through routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children. However, transmission continues to occur due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment. Alternative strategies, such as mass drug administration (MDA), are being explored to accelerate the interruption of transmission.

    Research Question: Can criteria be defined to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely at earlier timepoints, rather than after two years of surveillance, in a community-based cluster-randomized trial?

    Methods: A stochastic, individual-based simulation model was employed to simulate the DeWorm3 trial, which compares a control arm (annual treatment of children alone with MDA) with an intervention arm (community-wide biannual treatment with MDA). Simulations were run for each scenario for both Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm. A range of threshold prevalences measured at six months after the last round of MDA and the impact of MDA coverage levels were evaluated.

    Main Findings: The analyses suggest that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. Models indicate a tight range of homogeneous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters, which do not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA.

    Implications: Determining whether a transmission breakpoint has not been reached at early stages of the trial will be beneficial to reduce efforts of continuous monitoring in settings where transmission interruption is unlikely and to avoid bounce-back to pre-treatment prevalences and worm-burdens during the no-treatment phase.

    Conclusions: This study provides insights into the feasibility of transmission interruption of STH infections through MDA and highlights the importance of early assessment of transmission interruption. The findings suggest that a two-year surveillance period may be sufficient to determine whether transmission interruption has been achieved, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage.

    **Title:** Development of a Serogroup-Specific Cholera Conjugate Vaccine Inducing Protective Immunity in Mice

    **Background:** Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, is a significant public health concern worldwide. Protective immunity against cholera is serogroup specific, determined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic, particularly in young children.

    **Research Question:** Can a conjugate vaccine for cholera, composed of V. cholerae O1 Ogawa O-Specific Polysaccharide-core (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc), induce protective immunity in mice?

    **Methods:** Mice were immunized intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:TThc or OSP only, with or without dmLT, a non-toxigenic immunoadjuvant derived from heat labile toxin of Escherichia coli. Serum IgG and IgM antibody responses targeting OSP and LPS were measured.

    **Main Findings:** We detected significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP following a single immunization in mice receiving OSP:TThc with or without adjuvant. Anti-LPS IgG responses were detected following a second immunization in these cohorts. Administration of OSP:TThc and adjuvant also induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that a cholera conjugate vaccine containing OSP recovered from V. cholerae is protectively immunogenic and induces anti-OSP memory B cell responses in mice. This vaccine has the potential to induce long-term protective immunity, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that a cholera conjugate vaccine could be an effective tool in preventing cholera outbreaks. The use of a recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc) as a carrier protein in the conjugate vaccine is a novel approach that could be applied to other vaccines. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in humans.

    **Title:** Candida albicans Inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence through Suppression of Pyochelin and Pyoverdine Gene Expression

    **Research Question:** How do bacterial-fungal interactions modulate the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the gastrointestinal tract?

    **Methods:** We used a neutropenic mouse model of microbial gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination to investigate the effects of Candida albicans on Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence. We analyzed the expression of P. aeruginosa pyochelin and pyoverdine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. We also examined the effects of heat-killed C. albicans, C. albicans secreted proteins, and oral iron supplementation on P. aeruginosa virulence.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that C. albicans inhibits P. aeruginosa virulence by suppressing the expression of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes, which are essential for iron acquisition and virulence. Heat-killed C. albicans had no effect on P. aeruginosa, whereas C. albicans secreted proteins directly suppressed P. aeruginosa pyoverdine and pyochelin expression and inhibited P. aeruginosa virulence in mice. Oral iron supplementation restored P. aeruginosa virulence in P. aeruginosa and C. albicans colonized mice.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial-fungal interactions in the gastrointestinal tract and highlight the importance of iron acquisition in P. aeruginosa virulence. The suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine gene expression by C. albicans secreted proteins represents a novel mechanism of fungal inhibition of bacterial virulence.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that C. albicans can modulate P. aeruginosa virulence through the suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine gene expression. These findings have important implications for understanding the complexities of polymicrobial, polykingdom infections and identifying new therapeutic targets for preventing microbial disease. Our results also suggest that oral iron supplementation may be a potential strategy for restoring P. aeruginosa virulence in the presence of C. albicans.

    **Title:** Delayed Reversion of Escape Mutant HIV-1 and SIV: Implications for Viral Load and Pathogenicity

    **Research Question:** What is the rate and timing of reversion to wild-type (WT) virus following infection with escape mutant (EM) HIV-1 or SIV, and how does this impact viral load and pathogenicity?

    **Methods:** We used a sensitive PCR assay to quantify reversion to WT of SIV and SHIV viruses containing minor amounts of WT virus in pigtail macaques. We inoculated animals with mixes of EM and WT virus, as well as biologically passaged SHIVmn229 viruses with smaller proportions of WT sequence, and a molecular clone of pure EM SIVmac239.

    **Main Findings:** Infection with mixes of EM and WT virus containing ≥10% WT virus resulted in immediate and rapid outgrowth of WT virus at SIV Gag CD8 T cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, infection with biologically passaged SHIVmn229 viruses with smaller proportions of WT sequence, or a molecular clone of pure EM SIVmac239, demonstrated a delayed or slow pattern of reversion. WT virus was not detectable until ≥8 days after inoculation and took ≥8 weeks to become the dominant quasispecies. A delayed pattern of reversion was associated with significantly lower viral loads.

    **Implications:** The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT virus, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The delay in reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 T cell escape mutations in some scenarios suggests opportunities to reduce the pathogenicity of HIV during very early infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the rate and timing of reversion to WT virus following infection with EM HIV-1 or SIV is highly variable and dependent on the diversity of the infecting inoculum. The delayed reversion of EM virus to WT virus is associated with lower viral loads, suggesting that this phenomenon may contribute to reduced pathogenicity in some infections. These findings have important implications for the development of strategies to reduce the pathogenicity of HIV during early infection.

    **Title:** Molecular Mechanisms of Cadmium Resistance in Yeast Strains from Evolution Canyon, Israel

    **Research Question:** What are the underlying molecular mechanisms of cadmium resistance in yeast strains collected from Evolution Canyon, Israel?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a set of yeast strains collected from Evolution Canyon, Israel, for their tolerance to cadmium and identified the genetic basis of cadmium resistance. We performed molecular analyses of the PCA1 gene, which encodes a P-type ATPase required for cadmium efflux, and reconstructed the promoter sequence of PCA1 in different yeast species.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that cadmium resistance in yeast strains from Evolution Canyon is primarily caused by an enhanced function of the PCA1 metal efflux pump. Molecular analyses reveal that mutations in the PCA1 promoter sequence are responsible for this enhancement, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments demonstrate that three single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter quantitatively increase its activity and enhance cadmium resistance. Furthermore, we found that the critical nucleotides responsible for cadmium resistance are conserved and functionally important in other yeast species, suggesting that they represent an ancestral type.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff between metal resistance and fitness under low cadmium conditions. We propose that the spread of a weak PCA1 allele in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations is a result of regulatory fine-tuning that allows cells to maintain a certain level of cadmium efflux activity without compromising their fitness under normal conditions.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of regulatory changes in the PCA1 gene in conferring cadmium resistance in yeast strains from Evolution Canyon. The conservation of critical nucleotides in the PCA1 promoter across different yeast species suggests that they represent an ancestral type that has been lost in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of metal resistance in yeast and has implications for understanding the evolution of adaptation to novel or adverse environments.

Title: Systematic Identification of Oncogenic Pathways in Gastric Cancer and Their Impact on Patient Survival

Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, with a high degree of heterogeneity in its deregulation of different oncogenic pathways. We aimed to identify major oncogenic pathways in GC with significant relationships to patient survival.

Methods: Using gene expression signatures, we devised an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. We selected eleven oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways previously implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, including RAS, p53, BRCA1, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB. We developed an in silico method to map activation levels of different pathways in cohorts of complex primary tumor profiles and validated this pathway-directed classification approach using proof-of-concept examples from breast cancer.

Results: We identified three oncogenic pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin) deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric cancers. We functionally validated these pathway predictions in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions may play an important role in influencing disease behavior. Individual GCs can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups.

Implications: Our findings suggest that predicting pathway activity by expression signatures permits the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers, at a scale not currently achievable by other platforms. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of GC biology and may lead to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using gene expression signatures to predict patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in gastric cancer. The identification of three major oncogenic pathways deregulated in the majority of GCs highlights the importance of considering pathway interactions in understanding GC biology and developing targeted therapies. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.

    **Title:** Stress-Induced DNA Duplex Destabilization and Transcriptional Regulation in Prokaryotes

    **Research Question:** Do stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) sites in the upstream regions of prokaryotic genes play a role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in response to environmental and physiological changes?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the SIDD profiles of the entire Escherichia coli K12 genome and examined the association between SIDD sites and the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators. We also investigated the SIDD properties of functional families within the genomes of numerous free-living bacteria, as well as several obligate parasitic bacteria and endosymbionts.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that strong SIDD sites in the E. coli K12 genome are statistically significantly overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, particularly those that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli. We also found that genes in E. coli K12 that are involved in transcriptional regulation have a highly significant association with the strongest SIDD sites. Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant association of SIDD sites with upstream regions of genes functioning in transcription in 38 of 43 genomes of free-living bacteria, but in only four of 18 genomes of endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that strong SIDD sites 5′ to participating genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes, which are known to transiently alter superhelicity. We propose that these SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes in response to physiological or environmental changes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that SIDD sites in the upstream regions of prokaryotic genes play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in response to environmental and physiological changes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms governing gene expression in prokaryotes and highlight the importance of SIDD sites in mediating adaptive transcriptional responses to changing conditions.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Role of High-Mobility Group (HMG) Box Genes in the Sexual Cycle of Podospora anserina

    **Research Question:** What is the role of HMG-box genes in the sexual cycle of Podospora anserina, a filamentous ascomycete?

    **Methods:** Systematic deletion analysis of the eight uncharacterized HMG-box genes in P. anserina was performed to assess their essentiality and involvement in the sexual cycle. Transcriptional analyses of HMG-box genes in HMG-box deletion strains were also conducted to elucidate their regulatory relationships.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that 11 out of 12 HMG-box genes in P. anserina are involved in the sexual cycle, with PaHMG5 acting as a pivotal activator of mating-type genes and PaHMG9 functioning as a repressor of stationary phase-specific phenomena, including hyphal anastomoses. We identified a network of HMG-box genes upstream of the FMR1 and FPR1 mating-type genes, with PaHMG5 playing a central role in regulating mating-type gene transcription. Furthermore, we found that PaHMG5 and its ortholog SpSte11 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating-type genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the critical role of HMG-box members in sexual reproduction in fungi, with 11 out of 12 members involved in the sexual cycle in P. anserina. The conservation of PaHMG5 and SpSte11 suggests a commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi, with the P. anserina and S. pombe mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor forming a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module in mammals.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role and relationships of HMG-box genes in P. anserina, revealing a complex network of HMG-box genes involved in the regulation of mating-type genes and mating-type target genes. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of sex regulation in eukaryotes and highlight the importance of HMG-box genes in the sexual cycle of fungi.

    **Title:** Persistence of Ebola Virus in Survivors’ Body Fluids: An Observational Cohort Study in Sierra Leone

    **Background:** The 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic raised concerns about the persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) in survivors’ body fluids and the potential risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. Prior to this epidemic, limited data were available on EBOV persistence in survivors’ body fluids.

    **Research Question:** What is the persistence of EBOV in survivors’ body fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, and tears?

    **Methods:** An observational cohort study was conducted in Sierra Leone during the EVD epidemic response operation. The study consisted of two phases. Phase 1 assessed the persistence of EBOV in semen of 100 adult men, initiated within five months of initial protocol discussions. Phase 2 assessed the persistence of virus in multiple body fluids of 120 men and 120 women.

    **Main Findings:** The study demonstrated that EBOV can persist in survivors’ body fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk, for an extended period. The findings informed national and global guidelines, highlighting the need to implement semen testing programs among EVD survivors.

    **Implications:** The study’s results accelerated the implementation of semen testing programs in EVD-affected countries and informed studies examining the persistence of Zika virus. The study’s rapid implementation, despite challenging circumstances, underscores the importance of adequate resources for research during public health emergencies.

    **Conclusions:** This observational cohort study provides critical insights into the persistence of EBOV in survivors’ body fluids, informing public health practice and policy. The study’s rapid implementation and findings demonstrate the value of research in responding to epidemics of poorly characterized diseases. Adequate resources should be allocated to answer critical research questions to inform response efforts and prevent future outbreaks.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Chemical Nature of Cellular Microenvironments: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding Bacterial Chemotaxis

    **Research Question:** What are the statistical properties of the chemical gradients that chemotactic Escherichia coli cells typically encounter in their natural environment?

    **Methods:** We employed a multidisciplinary approach combining in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, information theory, and simulations to analyze the dose-response curves of the bacterial chemotaxis sensory system. We reevaluated the phenomenological Weber's law and its generalizations to the Weber-Fechner law and fold-change detection (FCD) to predict the average gradients cells experience.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that chemotactic E. coli cells typically encounter broad distributions of exponential gradients in their natural habitat, leading to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. We found that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient (chemotactic index), and hence the drift velocity of cells swimming up the gradient.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The findings suggest that the chemotaxis sensory system has evolved to maintain perception in exponential gradients, which are common in natural environments.

    **Conclusions:** Our multidisciplinary approach has connected a large number of phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level, shedding light on the statistical properties of the chemical gradients that chemotactic E. coli cells encounter in their natural environment. Our results have implications for understanding the complex interactions between cells and their environment, and highlight the importance of considering the statistical properties of stimuli in understanding sensory systems. This study provides a foundation for further research into the chemical nature of cellular microenvironments and the evolution of sensory systems.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Mystery of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Lifespan: A Reliability Theory Perspective

    **Research Question:** What controls the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the same animal, exposed to the same environment?

    **Methods:** We employed clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling to investigate the lifespan of HSCs. Our approach was based on reliability theory, which accounts for the diversity of lifespans of HSCs.

    **Main Findings:** We found that the repopulation failure kinetics of each HSC are largely anti-persistent, or mean-reverting, processes. This means that failure rates repeatedly increase during population-wide division events and are counteracted and decreased by repair processes. However, in the long-run, a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior occurs, leading to rapid clonal extinction. Our results suggest that the repair capacity of HSCs is self-limiting.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of aging in HSCs and other non-homogenous, hierarchically organized cell systems. We propose that the lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics. Shorter and longer lived HSCs differ significantly in their pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a new model based on reliability theory to account for the diversity of lifespans of HSCs. We show that the lifespan of each HSC is determined by pre-programmed differences in repair capacity. Our approach does not depend on particular failure sources and repair mechanisms, making it a valuable tool for interpreting longitudinal network data. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of aging in HSCs and other cell systems, and may lead to new avenues for interpreting stem cell Omics data.

    **Title:** Antibody-Mediated Immunity against Helminths: A Novel Mechanism of Alternative Macrophage Activation

    **Research Question:** How do antibodies contribute to protective immunity against helminth infections, and what are the underlying mechanisms of antibody-mediated macrophage activation?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of antibodies in mediating immunity against the natural murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hp) using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. Mice lacking antibodies (JH−/−) or activating Fc receptors (FcRγ−/−) were challenged with Hp, and their immune responses were compared to those of wild-type mice.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that helminth-specific antibodies induce the rapid trapping of tissue-migrating helminth larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infection. Antibody-activated macrophages upregulate Arginase-1 expression, leading to the immobilization of infective and tissue-dwelling larvae. Furthermore, we show that antibodies induce FcRγ- and complement-dependent adherence of macrophages to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete larval immobilization.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel IL-4Rα-independent mechanism of alternative macrophage activation that is antibody-dependent and mediates anti-helminth immunity. This mechanism involves the reprogramming of macrophages to express wound-healing associated genes, including Arginase-1, which directly impairs larval motility.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against helminths and highlights the importance of antibodies in activating macrophages to modulate the expression of genes associated with the alternatively activated phenotype. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against helminth infections, which affect approximately one-third of the world's population. Our discovery of a novel subtype of IL-4Rα-independent alternatively activated macrophages, which we refer to as helminth-antibody activated macrophages (HAAM), opens up new avenues for understanding the complex interactions between antibodies, macrophages, and helminth parasites.

    **Title:** Real-time Visualization of Chromosome Dynamics during Homologous Recombination Reveals Transient Confinement of Damaged Chromatin

    **Research Question:** What are the dynamics of chromosome resection during the early steps of homologous recombination (HR) in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel, non-intrusive visualization system, ParB-INT, which uses protein oligomerization to form visible foci, allowing for real-time analysis of chromosome dynamics in single living cells. We applied this system to Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells undergoing HO cleavage of the MAT locus on chromosome III.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the damaged chromatin region is transiently confined during the early steps of resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. We observed that resection in a yku70 mutant began ∼10 min earlier than in wild-type cells, defining this as the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. Furthermore, we discovered a distinct phase of confinement of chromatin neighboring the DSB early in the resection period.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics and mechanism of resection during HR, a critical process for maintaining genome integrity. The ParB-INT visualization system will be widely applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics, and function in normal and pathological contexts, such as gene expression, replication, and recombination.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of the ParB-INT system in visualizing chromosome dynamics in real-time, without interfering with the process under study. This approach will enable researchers to investigate the complex interactions between chromatin, DNA repair, and other cellular processes, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of genome maintenance and its dysregulation in disease.

    **Title:** Estimating the Rate and Timing of Trypanosoma cruzi Reinfections in Humans: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** What is the frequency and timing of Trypanosoma cruzi reinfections in humans living in areas with active vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease?

    **Methods:** We implemented stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and assess the frequency of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. We used a hybrid genetic algorithm to fit the models to epidemiological data from Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of T. cruzi reach 56% in humans.

    **Main Findings:** Our models predicted an annual reinfection rate of 0.032 (0.008-0.042) per individual, with 98.4% of reinfections occurring in the chronic phase. We also found that the parasite escapes the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of the events of re-inoculation. The estimated risks of reinfection during the chronic stage of the disease are 14% (4-18%) and 60% (21-70%) after 5 and 30 years, respectively, with most individuals being re-infected 1-3 times overall.

    **Implications:** Our results have significant implications for vaccine development and our understanding of the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas. The low rates of reinfection are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first estimate of the frequency of human reinfection with T. cruzi and sheds light on the timing of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. Our findings suggest that reinfections are a common occurrence in humans living in areas with active vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease, and that the parasite can evade the adaptive immune response in a significant proportion of cases. These results have important implications for the development of effective prevention and control strategies for Chagas disease.

    **Title:** Pre-existing Immune Responses to Dengue Virus Predict Clinical Outcome of Subsequent Infection

    **Research Question:** Do pre-existing immune responses to dengue virus (DENV) predict the clinical outcome of subsequent DENV infection?

    **Methods:** Blood samples were collected from a cohort of school-aged Thai children before and after DENV infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with DENV, and the secretion of 30 cytokines was measured using a multiplexed, bead-based array.

    **Main Findings:** Significant differences were found in cytokine production based on both the type of DENV used for stimulation and the occurrence of clinical illness. PBMC from subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection secreted higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1, whereas IL-6 was produced by PBMC from all subjects who subsequently developed symptomatic infection, but only 59% of subjects with subclinical infection. In contrast, PBMC from subjects with symptomatic infection secreted lower levels of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate significant differences in pre-existing immune responses to DENV associated with the clinical outcome of subsequent infection. The existence of both protective and pathologic immune profiles is supported by the observation of higher levels of some cytokines in subjects with symptomatic infection and higher levels of other cytokines in subjects with subclinical infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms controlling differential clinical outcomes in DENV infection. The identification of specific cytokine profiles associated with symptomatic and subclinical infection may be useful for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings can be generalized to other populations and to investigate the potential role of IL-6 in dengue disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering pre-existing immune responses in the development of effective dengue vaccines and treatments.

    **Research Question:** How does the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway contribute to pattern formation in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, and what is the role of Hh gradient dynamics in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and in vivo experiments to investigate the dynamics of Hh signaling in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We used numerical simulations of Equations 1-5 to predict the behavior of the Hh gradient and its effects on gene expression patterns.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh, and that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. We observed a spatial "overshoot" of the Hh gradient, a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. This overshoot is necessary for the establishment of distinct borders of gene expression patterns in response to Hh. Furthermore, we found that the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor Patched (Ptc) contributes to the overshoot, and that altering the network structure such that Ptc is no longer up-regulated in response to Hh-signaling activation results in overlapping patterns of gene expression.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Hh gradient dynamics play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. This challenges the prevailing view that Hh functions as a classical morphogen, and instead proposes a new model of pattern formation that takes into account the dynamic behavior of the Hh gradient.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study provides evidence for the importance of Hh gradient dynamics in pattern formation in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We propose that the overshoot of the Hh gradient, resulting from Ptc up-regulation, is necessary for the establishment of distinct borders of gene expression patterns in response to Hh. These findings have implications for our understanding of Hh signaling and pattern formation in development, and highlight the importance of considering gradient dynamics in the interpretation of Hh signaling.

    **Title:** Positional Cloning and Characterization of a Novel Mouse Mutation Affecting Sensitivity to Ethanol and Anesthetics

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the influence of ethanol and inhaled anesthetics on the nervous system?

    **Methods:** We conducted an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) forward mutagenesis screen in mice to identify animals with enhanced locomotor activity. We isolated a new mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) unc-79 gene. We characterized the phenotype of Lwt/Lwt homozygotes and Lwt/+ heterozygotes in response to ethanol and anesthetics.

    **Main Findings:** Lwt/Lwt homozygotes are perinatal lethal, while Lwt/+ heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants. Lwt/+ heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans. The acute hypersensitivity to and increased voluntary consumption of ethanol observed in Lwt/+ heterozygous mice, combined with the observed hypersensitivity to ethanol in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants, highlights the importance of this pathway in determining ethanol sensitivity.

    **Conclusions:** We have identified a novel mouse mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of the C. elegans unc-79 gene. Our results demonstrate that Lwt/+ heterozygotes are hypersensitive to ethanol and anesthetics, consistent with a conserved function of the mammalian unc-79 gene product. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of ethanol and anesthetics on the nervous system and suggest a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
Title: Elucidating the Anopheles gambiae Immune Response against Plasmodium falciparum: Unveiling the Imd Pathway as a Promising Target for Malaria Control

    Abstract:
    The Anopheles gambiae immune response against Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of human malaria, has been identified as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms for malaria control. The Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, has been shown to possess potent anti-P. falciparum activity. Our study aimed to investigate the Imd pathway's role in the anti-Plasmodium response and identify potential targets for malaria control. We employed RNA interference to silence caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, and other pathway components, revealing genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar. Our results demonstrate that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. Furthermore, we found that caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response, even in the absence of resident gut microbiota. We also established the relevance of Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense. Our findings highlight the physiological considerations necessary for the implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae as part of an effort to limit the malaria transmission cycle and reveal previously unrecognized nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum.

    Research Question:
    What are the key components of the Anopheles gambiae immune response against Plasmodium falciparum, and how can the Imd pathway be exploited for malaria control?

    Methods:
    We employed RNA interference to silence caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, and other pathway components in A. gambiae mosquitoes. We also used a standard silencing protocol to assess immune responses directed against the ookinete stage of Plasmodium.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. We also found that caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response, even in the absence of resident gut microbiota. Furthermore, we identified genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar, including TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that the Imd pathway is a promising target for malaria control, and that caspar silencing alone can induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response. The identification of TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 as key players in the anti-Plasmodium response highlights their potential as targets for malaria control.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the Anopheles gambiae immune response against Plasmodium falciparum and identifies the Imd pathway as a promising target for malaria control. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of novel malaria control strategies and highlight the importance of understanding the physiological considerations necessary for the implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae.
Title: Investigating the Anti-Fibrotic Potential of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMMSCs) in Experimental Pulmonary Fibrosis Induced by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Infection

    Abstract:

    Background: Pulmonary fibrosis is a debilitating disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to irreversible lung damage. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been proposed as a potential therapy for fibrotic diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. However, the efficacy of BMMSCs in treating chemical- or physical-induced pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear.

    Methods: We investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of BMMSCs in an experimental model of lung fibrosis induced by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection in BALB/c mice. Mice were inoculated with P. brasiliensis yeasts and treated with BMMSCs or itraconazole (ITC) alone or in combination. Histopathological examination, fibrocytes counts, soluble collagen, and fibrosis-related gene expression in lungs were evaluated.

    Main Findings: Our results show that late infusion of BMMSCs into mice infected with P. brasiliensis does not have any anti-fibrotic effect. Instead, BMMSCs treatment significantly increased fibrocytes count, soluble collagen, and collagen-3α1, TGF-β3, MMP-8, and MMP-15 gene expression in infected mice. Notably, the combined therapy of BMMSCs/ITC reduced TIMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression in infected mice. Furthermore, human fibroblasts stimulated with homogenized lung supernatants from infected and BMMSCs-transplanted mice showed a higher expression of collagen I.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that BMMSCs may exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis induced by P. brasiliensis infection, possibly due to their interaction with the fungus or the inflammatory microenvironment. However, the combined therapy of BMMSCs/ITC showed promising results in reducing TIMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression.

    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that BMMSCs may not be effective in treating pulmonary fibrosis induced by P. brasiliensis infection. However, the combined therapy of BMMSCs/ITC may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing fibrosis-related gene expression. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of BMMSCs on pulmonary fibrosis and to explore the therapeutic potential of BMMSCs/ITC combination therapy.
Title: Seasonal Dynamics of Phlebotomine Vectors of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean Subregion: Implications for Leishmaniasis Transmission

    Abstract:

    Background: The recent expansion of phlebotomine vectors of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean subregion has been linked to climate change. Understanding the seasonal dynamics of these vectors is crucial for predicting future scenarios of leishmaniasis transmission.

    Methods: In 2011-2013, a consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries conducted entomological investigations in sites where L. infantum transmission was recently reported. A common protocol for sand fly collection included monthly captures by CDC light traps, complemented by sticky traps in most sites. Collections were replicated for more than one season to reduce the effects of local weather events.

    Main Findings: Data from 99,000 collected specimens were analyzed, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies belonging to L. infantum vector species. Time of sand fly appearance/disappearance in collections differed between sites, and seasonal densities showed variations in each site. Significant correlations were found between latitude/mean annual temperature of sites and the first month of sand fly appearance, which ranged from early April to the first half of June. A 3-modal trend, recorded for P. tobbi in Cyprus, represents a novel finding for a L. infantum vector.

    Implications: The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion, as inferred by adult densities calculated from 3 years, 37 sites, and 6 competent vector species, was associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve having a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period. No risk for leishmaniasis transmission took place from December through March in the years considered.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide a robust starting point for continuing surveillance on sand fly dynamics that may impact on leishmaniasis transmission in the near future. A common pattern of nocturnal females' activity, whose density peaked between 11 pm and 2 am, was observed. The potential risk for L. infantum transmission in the Mediterranean was identified in the June-October period (97% relative vector density), with density waves of adults occurring earlier and more frequently in southern territories. These results highlight the importance of monitoring sand fly activity and abundance to predict leishmaniasis risk associated with climate change.

    **Title:** Orientia tsutsugamushi Induces Type I Interferon Response and M1 Polarization in Human Monocytes: Implications for Scrub Typhus Pathogenesis

    **Research Question:** What is the transcriptional response of human monocytes to Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, and how does it relate to the pathogenesis of the disease?

    **Methods:** Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were infected with live or heat-killed O. tsutsugamushi, and gene expression was analyzed using microarray analysis. The results were compared to those from patients with scrub typhus.

    **Main Findings:** O. tsutsugamushi induced a significant upregulation of more than 4,500 genes in monocytes, including type I interferon (IFN), interferon-stimulated genes, and genes associated with M1 polarization of macrophages. Live O. tsutsugamushi was indispensable for the type I IFN response and apoptosis, and enhanced the expression of M1-associated cytokines. Monocytes infected with live O. tsutsugamushi produced IFN-β, whereas those incubated with heat-killed bacteria did not.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that O. tsutsugamushi induces a specific M1 phenotype and stimulates a type I IFN response in human monocytes, which may be associated with the inflammatory complications of scrub typhus. The upregulation of genes involved in polarized immune responses, including IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, GM-CSF, and CCL20, further supports this hypothesis.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of scrub typhus, highlighting the critical role of IFN-mediated activation of monocytes and their subsequent polarization into an M1 phenotype. These findings may lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for scrub typhus and provide a better understanding of the immune response to O. tsutsugamushi. The results also suggest that activated or inflammatory monocytes may play a major role in the dissemination of O. tsutsugamushi, similar to other pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and human cytomegalovirus.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Neural Mechanisms of Route Memory in Desert Ants: A Spiking Neural Model of the Mushroom Body Circuit

    **Research Question:** How do desert ants (Cataglyphis velox) implement visual memory to follow extended routes through complex environments, and what is the role of the mushroom body (MB) circuit in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a spiking neural model of the MB circuit, originally developed to describe fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) olfactory association, to simulate the ability of desert ants to rapidly learn visual routes through complex natural environments. We used realistic stimuli derived from field experiments, focusing on visual cues rather than olfactory cues.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations demonstrate that the neural architecture of the ant MB can plausibly form the substrate for the familiarity algorithm of Baddeley et al. (2011). We show that the MB can learn over 80 on-route images, reconstructed from real ant viewpoints in their natural habitat, and reliably distinguish them from highly similar images obtained when looking off-route. Strikingly, the network, originally developed for simple olfactory associative learning in flies, required almost no modification other than increased size to perform the apparently more complex function of supporting navigation under realistic conditions.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the MB circuit is a crucial component of the neural mechanisms underlying route memory in desert ants. The ability of the MB to learn and store sparse codes enables the theoretical storage capacity of the ant mushroom body to be estimated at hundreds of independent images. This has significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of navigation in insects and potentially other animals.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a spiking neural model of the MB circuit can account for the ability of desert ants to rapidly learn visual routes through complex natural environments. We propose that the neural architecture of the ant MB is a plausible substrate for the familiarity algorithm of Baddeley et al. (2011), and that the MB circuit plays a critical role in the neural mechanisms underlying route memory in desert ants. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural basis of navigation in insects and potentially other animals.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Pathogen-Triggered Leaf Abscission in Arabidopsis: A Novel Defense Strategy Against Bacterial Infection

    **Research Question:** How do plants utilize leaf abscission as a defense mechanism against bacterial infection, and what are the molecular components involved in this process?

    **Methods:** We developed a system to study pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis by infecting cauline leaves with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial pathogen. We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to identify the molecular components required for pathogen-triggered leaf abscission.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Pseudomonas syringae lacking a functional type III secretion system fail to elicit an abscission response, suggesting that the abscission response is a novel form of immunity triggered by effectors. We found that HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED are required for pathogen-triggered abscission to occur. Additionally, we discovered that phytoalexin deficient 4, enhanced disease susceptibility 1, salicylic acid induction-deficient 2, and senescence-associated gene 101 plants with mutations in genes necessary for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, and NahG transgenic plants with low levels of salicylic acid fail to abscise cauline leaves normally. We propose a threshold model regulating cauline leaf defense, where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, cauline leaves are shed.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that salicylic acid plays a crucial role in regulating both pathogen- and drought-triggered leaf abscission. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense against bacterial infection and highlights the importance of leaf abscission as a defense strategy.

    **Conclusions:** We define a new model system for studying pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis and begin to explain the genetics governing this process. Our results demonstrate that the abscission pathway is required for all known forms of inducible leaf abscission in Arabidopsis and that salicylic acid is necessary for proper pathogen-triggered leaf abscission to occur. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of plant defense mechanisms and may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling plant diseases.

    **Title:** Dendritic Computation of Direction Selectivity in Starburst Amacrine Cells

    **Research Question:** How do starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina compute direction selectivity (DS) in response to visual stimuli?

    **Methods:** We used somatic whole-cell recordings and Fourier analysis to measure electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli in SACs. We also employed two-photon microscopy to monitor [Ca2+] changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SACs generate larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is from their somata towards their dendritic tips than for motion in the opposite direction. This direction selectivity (DS) persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential. Fourier analysis revealed that fundamental and harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity in the response. We also found that the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input, and that high-voltage–activated Ca2+ channels are active at rest.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination. This dendrite-intrinsic mechanism is independent of lateral inhibitory interactions, as demonstrated by the persistence of DS signals in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that SACs use a dendrite-intrinsic mechanism to compute direction selectivity, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient. This mechanism allows SACs to generate DS signals in response to visual stimuli, independent of lateral inhibitory interactions. These findings have important implications for our understanding of visual processing in the retina and the role of SACs in direction selectivity.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Determinants of Infective Dose and Virulence in Human Pathogens

    **Background:** The number of pathogens required to infect a host, known as the infective dose, varies significantly across pathogen species. Recent predictions suggest that infective dose is influenced by the mode of action of molecules used by pathogens to facilitate infection, with locally acting molecules requiring lower infective doses than distantly acting molecules.

    **Research Question:** Do pathogens using locally acting molecules have lower infective doses and are they less virulent than those using distantly acting molecules?

    **Methods:** We conducted a broad-scale comparative analysis of 43 human pathogens from diverse taxonomic groups, including enteropathogenic bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses. We examined the relationship between infective dose, virulence, mode of action, mode of transmission, and route of infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that pathogens using locally acting molecules indeed have lower infective doses than those using distantly acting molecules. However, contrary to predictions, we found no significant relationship between the mechanism of pathogenesis and virulence. Instead, we observed a negative correlation between infective dose and virulence, indicating that pathogens with lower infective doses are more virulent. Furthermore, we found that pathogens infecting hosts through wounded skin result in significantly higher case fatality rates than those inhaled or ingested.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of mechanistic details in understanding the variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence. The results suggest that broad-scale comparative analyses can explain variation in these traits, and that the mode of action of molecules used by pathogens is a key determinant of infective dose. Our findings also underscore the importance of considering the route of infection and mode of transmission in understanding the virulence of pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first formal test of the predictions made by Schmid-Hempel and Frank regarding the relationship between mode of action and infective dose. Our results challenge the hypothesis that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators are more virulent and highlight the complexity of the relationship between infective dose and virulence in human pathogens.

    **Title:** Post-transcriptional regulation of schistosome development by the miR-277/4989 miRNA family

    **Research Question:** What is the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the developmental processes of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic helminth causing schistosomiasis?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel bioinformatics tool, Sylamer, to analyze the 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) of transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult stages of S. mansoni. We identified the miR-277/4989 family target sequence as the only one significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, which forms a miRNA cluster with sma-miR-277. We propose hairpin folds for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. Expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs is up-regulated in adults, while their predicted targets are significantly down-regulated in paired adult worms but remain largely undisturbed in immature females. We also found that sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells located proximal to the oesophagus gland and distributed throughout the male worms’ body.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the miR-277/4989 family plays a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development of juvenile worms and may be involved in the sexual development of female schistosomes. The high quality of the S. mansoni genome assembly allowed us to query 3’-UTR regions for miRNA target recognition sites conserved across three Schistosoma species.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides solid evidence for the role of miRNAs in the intra-mammalian development of S. mansoni. We propose that sma-miR-277 and sma-miR-4989 may be the primordial miRNAs driving an effect on the transcriptional landscape regulating gene expression changes underlying the development of juveniles and sexual maturation. Our findings have important implications for understanding the biology of schistosomes and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies against schistosomiasis.

    **Title:** Diverse SARS-Related Coronaviruses in Horseshoe Bats: Insights into the Origin and Evolution of SARS-CoV

    **Research Question:** What is the genetic diversity of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) in a single cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China, and what implications does this have for the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV?

    **Methods:** We conducted a 5-year longitudinal surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave in Yunnan Province, China, and analyzed the full-length genomes of 15 SARSr-CoV strains, including 11 newly discovered strains and 4 previously reported strains.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this cave are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8 regions. Strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, as well as in the ORF3 and ORF8 regions, were detected in this cave. We also found evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. Furthermore, cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. The co-circulation of different bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to SARS-CoV in the most variable S1, ORF8, and ORF3 regions in this single location highlights the importance of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and emphasizes the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of SARSr-CoVs in horseshoe bats to better understand the risk of future zoonotic transmission events. The discovery of SARSr-CoVs with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in multiple regions of the genome, including the NTD and RBD of the S1 gene, as well as in the ORF3 and ORF8 regions, suggests that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated from a recombination event between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.
Title: Investigating the Impact of Density-Dependent Fecundity on the Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) for Detecting Drug Resistance in Human Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STHs)

    Abstract:

    Background: The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) is a widely used method for detecting drug resistance in human soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). However, recent evidence suggests that density-dependent fecundity may distort FECRT data, leading to underestimation of drug efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of density-dependent fecundity on FECRT data and its implications for detecting drug resistance in human STHs.

    Methods: We examined recent evidence on the response of the canine hookworm to drug treatment and an early dataset describing the relationship between egg output and worm infection levels in humans. We analyzed the degree to which egg output increased in response to drug treatment and the extent to which worm populations were reduced.

    Main Findings: Our results showed that the degree of egg output increase coincided with the extent of worm population reduction in dogs harbouring worm isolates with different levels of resistance to the drug. Given the widespread occurrence of density-dependent worm fecundity constraints in human STHs, it is likely that this phenomenon will apply more widely to human STHs.

    Implications: The potential for distortion of FECRT data by density-dependent fecundity may make it difficult to identify apparent drug efficacy changes (i.e., the development of drug resistance) amongst a background of dynamic female worm reproductive biology. This highlights the need to develop new drug resistance monitoring methods that examine direct drug effects on isolated worms with in vitro phenotypic assays or changes in worm genotypes.

    Conclusions: The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) is considered the most useful technique currently available for detecting the emergence of resistance in STH infections in humans. However, our findings suggest that density-dependent fecundity may distort FECRT data, leading to underestimation of drug efficacy. To improve measurement of relative drug efficacy, it may be necessary to ensure a consistent degree of underestimation in groups of people involved in separate FECRTs. This may be achieved by omitting cases with the heaviest infections from a FECRT, as these cases may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output upon removal of density-dependent constraints. Ultimately, the development of new drug resistance monitoring methods is necessary to accurately detect the emergence of resistance in human STHs.
Title: Epithelial Heparan Sulfate Synthetase Ext1 Regulates Lung Branching Morphogenesis through SHH-FGF10 Signaling

    Abstract:

    Background: Branching morphogenesis of the mammalian lung is a complex process regulated by numerous factors, including cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Despite its importance, the role of heparan sulfate (HS) in this process remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of epithelial HS synthetase Ext1 in regulating lung branching morphogenesis, and how does it interact with SHH-FGF10 signaling?

    Methods: We used a mouse model with epithelial deletion of HS synthetase Ext1 to investigate the effects on lung branching morphogenesis. We analyzed lung morphology, FGF10 expression, and SHH signaling activity in mutant and wild-type lungs.

    Main Findings: Epithelial deletion of Ext1 resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number, associated with mesenchymal developmental defects. We observed increased FGF10 expression and FGF signaling activity in mutant lungs, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Furthermore, we found reduced SHH signaling activity, which is responsible for suppressing FGF10 expression. Reactivating SHH signaling in mutant lungs rescued the tip dilation phenotype and attenuated FGF signaling.

    Implications: Our study highlights the critical role of epithelial HS in maintaining SHH signaling activity, which is essential for lung branching morphogenesis. The reduced SHH signaling activity in mutant lungs is not caused by decreased Shh expression or protein stability, but rather by reduced production of biologically active SHH proteins.

    Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that epithelial HS synthetase Ext1 plays a crucial role in regulating SHH-FGF10 signaling during lung branching morphogenesis. The loss of HS in epithelial cells leads to an FGF gain-of-function phenotype, characterized by expanded branching tips and reduced branching number. Our study provides new insights into the complex interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung development and highlights the importance of HS in maintaining SHH signaling activity.

    **Title:** Optimizing Paired-End Sequencing for Accurate Detection of Genome Rearrangements and Fusion Genes in Cancer Genomes

    **Research Question:** How much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement breakpoints and localize them precisely in cancer genomes using paired-end sequencing, and how do different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, localization, and fusion gene detection?

    **Methods:** We employed both theoretical models and simulation to derive a formula for the probability that a fusion gene exists in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences from this genome. We applied this formula to compute fusion gene probabilities in several breast cancer samples and evaluated the impact of different sequencing parameters on breakpoint detection, localization, and fusion gene detection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that a relatively small number of fragments of large size are sufficient to accurately predict fusion genes in cancer samples. We also demonstrate that the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths and that different parameters of a sequencing strategy, such as the number and length of end-sequenced clones, impact breakpoint detection, localization, and fusion gene detection.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies. Paired-end sequencing of cancer genomes will provide highly reliable and precise detection of fusion genes, shedding new light on the genetic and genomic basis of cancer.

    **Conclusions:** Our study addresses several theoretical and practical considerations for assessing cancer genome organization using paired-end sequencing approaches. We provide formulae that elucidate the trade-offs in experimental design of both current and next-generation sequencing technologies. Our results highlight the importance of maximizing the probability of detecting fusion genes with the least amount of sequencing, taking into account factors such as the number and length of end-sequenced clones, the length of genes that are fused, and possible errors in breakpoint localization.

    **Title:** A Modular Mathematical Model of Chemotaxis Reveals the Interplay between Motility, Gradient Sensing, and Polarization

    **Research Question:** How do the separable but interrelated processes of motility, gradient sensing, and polarization contribute to chemotaxis in cells?

    **Methods:** We developed a mathematical model of chemotaxis using reaction-diffusion equations to simulate the coordinated action of these processes. The model consists of three modules: a central excitable network that accounts for random migration, a local excitation, global inhibition module that biases the direction of excitability, and a polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations demonstrate that the model can recreate most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells, including migration, changes in cellular morphology, and responses to uniform stimuli and gradients. The model also shows that adaptation is not absolutely required for chemotaxis, as cells without an adaptation mechanism can still perform efficient chemotaxis.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that chemotaxis is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple modules. The model provides a framework for understanding the interplay between motility, gradient sensing, and polarization, and highlights the importance of redundancy in the chemotactic signaling machinery. The findings have implications for our understanding of chemotaxis in single cell organisms, such as bacteria and amoebae, as well as multicellular systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our modular mathematical model of chemotaxis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex processes involved in chemotaxis. The model's ability to simulate cell movement under various scenarios illustrates the relative complexity and sophistication of the chemotactic signaling machinery. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of chemotaxis and highlight the importance of considering the interplay between motility, gradient sensing, and polarization in understanding chemotactic behavior.
Title: TDRD6 Regulates Spliceosome Maturation and mRNA Splicing in Prophase I Spermatocytes

    Abstract:
    The Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TDRD6) is a male germ line-specific protein essential for the structure of chromatoid bodies (ChBs), elongated spermatid development, and male fertility. We investigated the role of TDRD6 in the regulation of spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. Our results show that TDRD6 interacts with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, which supports splicing, and associates with the spliceosomal core protein SmB in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. In Tdrd6-/- diplotene spermatocytes, PRMT5 association with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are significantly reduced, leading to impaired assembly of spliceosomes and increased levels of U5 snRNPs. Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes revealed high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant usage of introns and exons, as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions. These findings demonstrate a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes, highlighting the importance of TDRD6 in the regulation of splicing events specific to spermatogenesis.

    Methods:
    We used mass spectrometric analysis to identify potential TDRD6-associated proteins, which revealed PRMT5 as a key protein methyltransferase of the splicing pathway. We also performed immunostaining of LAP-TDRD6 germ cells with α-Y12 antibody recognizing SmB and SmD, which revealed an overlap between the Y12 and LAP-TDRD6 signals in the nuclear periphery of diplotene cells.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that TDRD6 interacts with PRMT5 and associates with SmB in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. In Tdrd6-/- diplotene spermatocytes, PRMT5 association with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are significantly reduced, leading to impaired assembly of spliceosomes and increased levels of U5 snRNPs. Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes revealed high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant usage of introns and exons, as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions.

    Implications:
    These findings demonstrate a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes, highlighting the importance of TDRD6 in the regulation of splicing events specific to spermatogenesis. The data suggest that TDRD6 plays a crucial role in the maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs during the transcriptionally highly active prophase I of spermatogenesis.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the role of TDRD6 in the regulation of spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. The findings highlight the importance of TDRD6 in the regulation of splicing events specific to spermatogenesis and suggest that TDRD6 plays a crucial role in the maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs during the transcriptionally highly active prophase I of spermatogenesis.

**Title:** Bayesian Modeling of Bacterial Colonization Dynamics: A Probabilistic Approach to Estimating Acquisition and Clearance Rates

**Research Question:** How can we accurately estimate the rates of acquisition and clearance of bacterial populations that colonize a host, accounting for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, time intervals between consecutive measurements, and uncertainty in the estimated rates?

**Methods:** We developed a fully Bayesian model that provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing us to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Our method explicitly models the within-host variation using population genetic simulation, and the inference is done using a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

**Main Findings:** We validated our method with multiple carefully conducted simulations and demonstrated its use in practice by analyzing a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a large longitudinal clinical study. Our results show that our Bayesian model provides accurate estimates of acquisition and clearance rates, outperforming previous heuristic approaches that rely on fixed genetic distance thresholds.

**Implications:** Accurate estimation of acquisition and clearance rates is crucial for understanding within-host dynamics, response to interventions, and transmission of bacterial populations. Our Bayesian model provides a robust and accurate framework for analyzing colonization dynamics, enabling researchers to make informed decisions about the management and treatment of bacterial infections.

**Conclusions:** Our study presents a significant improvement over previous approaches to estimating acquisition and clearance rates, providing a probabilistic framework that accounts for the complexity of within-host bacterial populations. The R-code implementation of our method is freely available, allowing researchers to apply our approach to their own data. Our findings have important implications for the study of bacterial colonization dynamics and the development of effective strategies for controlling the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Auxin Transport in the Shoot Apical Meristem: A Flux-Based Polarization Hypothesis

    Abstract:
    The shoot apical meristem (SAM) of plants is responsible for the initiation of leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in a highly ordered, spiralled, or whorled pattern through the process of phyllotaxis. The plant hormone auxin plays a crucial role in this process, and its active transport is mediated by the PIN family of cellular hormone transporters. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain how auxin transporters create local auxin maxima at precise positions: canalization and flux-based polarization. While the canalization hypothesis explains organized auxin fluxes during vein formation, a second hypothesis proposes that auxin is systematically transported towards areas with the highest concentrations. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the SAM, providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. Our results suggest that the flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant, and further experiments are required to distinguish between flux-based polarization and other hypotheses.

    Research Question:
    What is the underlying mechanism of auxin transport in the shoot apical meristem, and can a flux-based polarization hypothesis explain this process?

    Methods:
    We used a dedicated computer simulation tool to model auxin transport in the SAM and test the flux-based polarization hypothesis.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the SAM, providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that the flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant, and further experiments are required to distinguish between flux-based polarization and other hypotheses.

    Conclusions:
    The flux-based polarization hypothesis provides a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant, and our results demonstrate that this hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the SAM. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of auxin transport and to distinguish between different hypotheses.

    **Title:** Identification of Diagnostic Biomarkers for Visceral Leishmaniasis using Comparative Genomics and In Silico Epitope Mapping

    **Research Question:** Can comparative genomics and in silico epitope mapping be used to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that can improve the sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)?

    **Methods:** We employed a systematic approach combining comparative genomics, in silico algorithms, and wet lab experiments to identify L. donovani protein candidates recognized by human IgG1, a potential indicator of post-chemotherapeutic relapse in VL. Immunoblots revealed L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients, which were then subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) for confident identification. We searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and presence of antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. Selected candidates had their linear epitopes mapped with in silico algorithms, and multiple high-scoring predicted epitopes were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and non-endemic healthy control (NEHC) patient sera.

    **Main Findings:** Over 90% of the proteins identified from the immunoblots did not satisfy the selection criteria and were excluded from the downstream epitope mapping. Screening of predicted epitope peptides from the shortlisted proteins identified the most reactive, for which the sensitivity for IgG1 was 84% (95% CI 60-97%) with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes. None of the sera from NEHCs were positive.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates the potential of combining comparative genomics and in silico epitope mapping to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers for VL. By predicting epitopes in silico, we screened a large number of peptides using arrays, identifying the most promising one, which showed promising results of both sensitivity and specificity on a small sample size. This proof-of-concept strategy can be applied to the development of more robust IgG1 RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the power of a systematic ‘omics’ approach in diagnostic research, incorporating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and bioinformatic prediction algorithms for the discovery of new biomarkers. The identified diagnostic biomarker has the potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for VL, enabling early case detection and surveillance.

    **Title:** Incidence of Caseating Granulomas in Cutaneous Leishmaniasis: A Multiregional Cohort Study

    **Research Question:** What is the incidence of caseating granulomas in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and how do they compare to other granuloma types in terms of geographical distribution, histological characteristics, and clinical outcomes?

    **Methods:** A multiregional cohort of 317 patients with CL from Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran was reviewed. Clinical and microscopic data were collected, including the presence and type of granuloma, Ridley's parasitic index (PI), and pattern (RP). The presence of microorganisms was evaluated using special stains and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for TB and CL.

    **Main Findings:** Granulomas were identified in 195 (61.5%) cases of CL, with 49 (25.2%) being caseating, 9 (4.6%) suppurative, and 137 (70.2%) tuberculoid without necrosis. Caseating and tuberculoid granuloma groups were significantly different in terms of geographical source, with more cases harboring caseating granulomas in Saudi Arabia (p < 0.0001). Histologically, both groups differed in the distribution of their RP, with a doubling RP3 in caseating granulomas (31% vs. 15%) and a doubling of RP5 in tuberculoid granuloma group (38% vs. 19%). Time needed to achieve healing (RP5) was shorter in tuberculoid vs. caseating group (4.0 vs. 6.2 months).

    **Implications:** This study documents an 18.2% incidence of caseating granulomas in CL, suggesting that CL should be considered part of the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, alongside TB and other causative infections. Cases of CL with caseating granulomas showed a slower healing process, with no association with specific species, which may be due to a worse host immune response or more aggressive Leishmania strains.

    **Conclusions:** This multiregional cohort study highlights the importance of considering CL as a potential cause of caseating granulomas in endemic regions, particularly in areas where TB is also prevalent. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the development of caseating granulomas in CL.
Title: Identification of Zfp69 as a Candidate Gene for the Diabetogenic Effect of Nidd/SJL QTL in Mouse Models of Type 2 Diabetes

    Abstract:

    Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Mouse models have been instrumental in elucidating the genetic basis of T2D, with the Nidd/SJL quantitative trait locus (QTL) on distal chromosome 4 identified as a major contributor to the disease.

    Research Question: What is the genetic basis of the diabetogenic effect of the Nidd/SJL QTL in mouse models of T2D?

    Methods: We employed a positional cloning approach to identify the candidate gene responsible for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL. Interval-specific congenic introgression of SJL into diabetes-resistant C57BL/6J mice and subsequent reporter crosses with New Zealand Obese (NZO) mice revealed a critical interval of 2.1 Mbp on distal chromosome 4. Sequencing, qRT-PCR, and RACE-PCR analysis of the 10 genes within this interval identified a striking allelic variance of Zfp69, a zinc finger domain transcription factor.

    Main Findings: The diabetogenic SJL, NON, and NZB alleles of Zfp69 generated a normal mRNA, whereas the NZO and C57BL/6J alleles produced a truncated mRNA lacking the coding sequence for the KRAB and Znf-C2H2 domains. When combined with the B6.V-Lepob background, the diabetogenic Zfp69SJL allele produced hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the human orthologue of Zfp69, ZNF642, were significantly increased in adipose tissue from patients with T2D.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate gene for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL, and that retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes substantially to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains. The expression of Zfp69 in adipose tissue may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D.

    Conclusions: The identification of Zfp69 as a candidate gene for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL QTL provides new insights into the genetic basis of T2D and highlights the importance of transcriptional regulation in the development of the disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the diabetogenic effect of Zfp69 and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target for T2D.

    **Title:** Elucidating Th Cell Differentiation Pathways: An Integrated Model of Regulatory Networks and Signalling Pathways

    **Research Question:** How do signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks control Th cell differentiation in the vertebrate hematopoietic system?

    **Methods:** We developed an integrated, comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation using a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses. To cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, we employed an original model reduction approach and a stable state identification algorithm. Systematic simulations were performed to assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation.

    **Main Findings:** Our model identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes, as well as transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. Our logical analysis highlighted the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Th cell differentiation is more complex than previously thought, with multiple stable states and transient hybrid cell types emerging in response to environmental cues. This has significant implications for our understanding of the vertebrate hematopoietic system and the regulation of immune responses.

    **Conclusions:** Our integrated model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the regulatory networks and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. By using a logical formalism and model reduction approach, we were able to identify stable states and transient hybrid cell types that co-exist in response to environmental cues. Our model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico, shedding light on the complex mechanisms underlying Th cell differentiation and the vertebrate hematopoietic system.

    **Title:** Predicting Transcription Factor Binding in Drosophila Embryos: A Thermodynamic Model Integrating DNA Sequence, Accessibility, and Protein Interactions

    **Research Question:** What are the biophysical forces that determine the binding of transcription factors to specific genomic regions during early embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster?

    **Methods:** We employed a thermodynamic model to evaluate the contribution of DNA sequence, in vitro protein-DNA affinities, cooperativity, and competition among five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. We incorporated experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility and in vivo binding data to refine our predictions.

    **Main Findings:** Our model achieved a correlation of ∼0.4 with experimental measurements of in vivo binding based on DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities alone. However, incorporating cooperativity and competition among the five factors and accounting for spatial patterning had little effect on prediction accuracy. By restricting predicted binding to regions of open chromatin, we improved our predictions to a correlation of 0.6-0.9 for various factors across known target genes. Our results show that, in regions of open chromatin, binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding can be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision. This approach has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms underlying quantitative variation in transcription factor binding and gene expression during development.

    **Conclusions:** Our thermodynamic model provides a framework for understanding the biophysical forces that shape transcription factor binding in Drosophila embryos. By integrating DNA sequence, accessibility, and protein interactions, we can predict the binding landscape of transcription factors with high accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of chromatin accessibility in determining transcription factor binding and suggest that sequence specificity is the primary driver of binding in regions of open chromatin. This study provides a practical method for predicting transcription factor binding and a platform for understanding the forces that shape quantitative variation in gene expression during development.

    **Title:** Emc Regulates Cell Proliferation by Transcriptionally Repressing String via Daughterless in Drosophila Epithelial Cells

    **Research Question:** How do the E protein family of basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors, specifically Daughterless (Da) and its inhibitor Extramacrochaetae (Emc), regulate cell proliferation in Drosophila epithelial cells?

    **Methods:** We employed genetic analysis to investigate the role of Emc and Da in controlling cell proliferation in Drosophila epithelial cells. Specifically, we examined the effects of Emc and Da on the G2/M transition and cell cycle progression.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da, which transcriptionally represses the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. We found that ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string, suggesting a novel mechanism of cell cycle regulation.

    **Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation in Drosophila epithelial cells. The identification of Emc and Da as key regulators of cell proliferation has important implications for our understanding of developmental biology and disease, particularly in the context of cancer.

    **Conclusions:** Our study defines a novel mechanism through which Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da, which transcriptionally represses string. This work highlights the importance of Emc and Da in controlling cell cycle progression and provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between E proteins and their inhibitors in regulating cell fate decisions. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of developmental biology and disease, and highlight the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for studying cell cycle regulation.

    **Title:** A Comprehensive Quantitative Analysis Pipeline for Identifying Key Proteins and Signaling Networks in Phosphoproteome Data

    **Research Question:** How can we develop a systematic approach to identify key proteins and signaling networks in phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments?

    **Methods:** We propose a comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline that integrates phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery to identify key proteins and signaling networks in phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments. We used SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations) to generate a yeast phosphoproteome dataset.

    **Main Findings:** Our pipeline successfully identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis, all of which are involved in stress responses. Notably, 9 of these proteins have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We further validated 4 predicted proteins (Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p, and Rcn2p) using interventional phenotypic experiments, which showed differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our approach.

    **Implications:** Our comprehensive pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. This approach can be applied to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.

    **Conclusions:** We demonstrate that interventional phosphoproteome studies can provide new insights into signaling pathways involved in biological processes such as yeast filamentous growth. Our pipeline addresses the challenges of phosphoproteomics, including sampling limitations and missing data, by integrating multiple analysis tools and providing a systematic approach to identify key proteins and signaling networks. This study highlights the potential of phosphoproteomics in understanding complex biological processes and identifying candidate proteins for further investigation.
Title: Elucidating the Regulation of the Drosophila X Chromosome in the Male Germline: A Reevaluation of Dosage Compensation and Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation

    Abstract:
    The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes has led to the development of dosage compensation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) in various organisms. However, the regulation of the X chromosome in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the expression of the X chromosome in Drosophila testes using microarray analysis, transgene reporters, and RNA-seq data. Our results reveal three key findings: (1) X chromosome-wide dosage compensation is absent from most of the Drosophila male germline; (2) there is no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis; and (3) the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes. These findings suggest that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. Our results resolve previous conflicting reports and have implications for understanding patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.

    Research Question:
    How is the X chromosome regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline?

    Methods:
    We used microarray analysis, transgene reporters, and RNA-seq data to investigate the expression of the X chromosome in Drosophila testes.

    Main Findings:
    (1) X chromosome-wide dosage compensation is absent from most of the Drosophila male germline; (2) there is no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis; and (3) the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. This has implications for understanding patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.

    Conclusions:
    Our study resolves previous conflicting reports and provides new insights into the regulation of the X chromosome in the Drosophila male germline. The absence of X chromosome-wide dosage compensation and the lack of evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis suggest that a novel mechanism is responsible for limiting expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.

    **Title:** Early Dynamics of Citrobacter rodentium Pathogenesis: Local Spread and Clonal Renewal of Epithelial Microcolonies Determine Disease Severity

    **Research Question:** How do Citrobacter rodentium microcolonies establish and persist in the colonic epithelium of mice, and what are the implications for disease severity and outcome?

    **Methods:** We used a mouse model of Citrobacter rodentium infection to investigate the early events of pathogenesis, focusing on the establishment and persistence of epithelial microcolonies.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that colonic epithelial microcolonies of Citrobacter rodentium are clonal populations that depend on local clonal growth to persist. We found that microcolonies are established exclusively within the first 18 hours of infection, and these early events shape the ongoing intestinal geography and severity of infection. Mechanistically, induced resistance to A/E lesion de-novo formation is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling and is induced specifically by virulent Citrobacter rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner.

    **Implications:** Our data demonstrate that the establishment phase of Citrobacter rodentium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a very short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity. The initiation of colonic Citrobacter rodentium microcolonies is limited to a very early stage of infection, and these early-established, clonally-renewing A/E lesions trigger a local innate immune response that protects the epithelium from de novo A/E lesion formation by luminal bacteria.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that the development of colonic Citrobacter rodentium A/E pathogenesis is critically dependent on very early bacteria-host interactions. The characteristic A/E lesions that determine the severity of infection originate from a limiting number of single-bacterial epithelial infection events that need to occur within the first 18 hours of infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) infections in humans, which share a similar pathogenic mechanism with Citrobacter rodentium.
Title: Bayesian Estimation of Population Overlap from Incomplete Samples: A Rigorous Approach to Quantifying β-Diversity

Abstract:

Background: Measuring the overlap between two populations is a fundamental problem in ecology, genomics, and epidemiology. However, estimating population overlap from incomplete samples is challenging due to stochastic data collection and sequencing techniques, leading to biased and uncertain estimates.

Research Question: Can we develop a Bayesian method to rigorously estimate population overlap from incomplete samples when the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known?

Methods: We derive and validate a Bayesian inference approach that takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. Our method provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates and can be used prospectively in study planning to quantify the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.

Main Findings: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a case study of Plasmodium falciparum parasites, where we estimate the true repertoire overlap between two parasites from incomplete samples. Our results show that the Bayesian approach provides more accurate and conservative estimates of overlap compared to existing methods, which systematically underestimate the true overlap.

Implications: Our method has significant implications for the analysis of β-diversity in ecology and genomic epidemiology, particularly in the study of Plasmodium spp. multigene antigen families. By incorporating larger whole-genome datasets as prior information, our method can improve estimates of repertoire overlap and provide a more comprehensive understanding of population diversity.

Conclusions: We present a Bayesian approach to estimating population overlap from incomplete samples, which provides a rigorous and unbiased framework for quantifying β-diversity. Our method has the potential to revolutionize the analysis of population overlap in various fields, including ecology, genomics, and epidemiology, and can be used prospectively in study planning to optimize sampling effort and uncertainty.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Intramolecular Interactions Regulating the Active State Mechanics of Eukaryotic Protein Kinases

    **Research Question:** How do intramolecular interactions regulate the active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases, and what is the role of the highly conserved β3-lysine residue in this process?

    **Methods:** Using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a representative model, we employed a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to investigate the intramolecular interactions regulating the active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that work harmoniously to regulate the active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix, as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Notably, we found that the highly conserved β3-lysine residue is not required for phosphoryl transfer, but rather plays a structural role in facilitating the active state mechanics by coordinating the transition of the β-sheet region of the N-lobe and linking it with the αC-helix.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the long-held assumption that the β3-lysine residue is essential for phosphoryl transfer in eukaryotic protein kinases. Instead, our results suggest that this residue plays a critical role in regulating the active state mechanics, which is essential for the proper functioning of these enzymes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying eukaryotic protein kinase function and regulation.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study provides new insights into the intramolecular interactions regulating the active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases. We demonstrate that a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions work together to regulate the active state mechanics, and that the β3-lysine residue plays a structural role in facilitating this process. These findings have important implications for our understanding of eukaryotic protein kinase function and regulation, and highlight the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these enzymes.
Title: Comparative Evaluation of School-Based and Community-Based Transmission Assessment Surveys for Post-Mass Drug Administration Surveillance of Lymphatic Filariasis in American Samoa

    Abstract:

    Background: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) recommends systematic post-mass drug administration (MDA) surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. We compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years and a community-based survey targeting people aged ≥8 years in American Samoa.

    Methods: In 2016, we conducted a systematic school-based TAS in all 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. We collected information on demographics and risk factors for infection using electronic questionnaires and recorded geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. Descriptive statistics were performed for questionnaire variables, and data were weighted and adjusted to account for sampling design and sex for both surveys, and for age in the community survey.

    Main Findings: The school-based TAS (n = 1143) identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3-1.8). The community-based survey (n = 2507, 711 households) identified 102 antigen-positive people and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5-8.6). Adjusted village-level prevalence ranged from 0-47.1%. CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen-positive community members from whom slides were prepared, 22 (25.6%) were microfilaraemic.

    Implications: Our study confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission in American Samoa 10 years after the last round of MDA. The school-based TAS had limited sensitivity (range 0-23.8%) and negative predictive value (range 25-83.3%) but had high specificity (range 83.3-100%) and positive predictive value (range 0-100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community-based survey, although operationally more challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence.

    Conclusions: Our findings raise concerns about the suitability of school-based TAS for post-MDA surveillance, not only in American Samoa but globally. School-based TAS may not provide a good indication of the overall CFA prevalence in older age groups and may not be sensitive at identifying foci of ongoing transmission. In contrast, community-based surveys can identify antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence, making them a more effective tool for post-MDA surveillance.
Title: Identification of Bmp15 as a Novel Regulator of Adult Female Sex Differentiation in Zebrafish

    Abstract:

    Background: Zebrafish, a widely used model organism, exhibits complex sex determination mechanisms influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. While the requirement of germ cells for female sex determination is well established, the role of oocytes in controlling sex differentiation and maintenance of the sexual phenotype remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: Do oocyte-expressed signaling molecules Gdf9 and Bmp15 play a role in female sex determination or maintenance of female sex differentiation in zebrafish?

    Methods: We generated targeted mutations in the genes encoding Bmp15 and Gdf9, two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, and examined their effects on female sex differentiation and maintenance in zebrafish.

    Main Findings: Our results show that females deficient in Bmp15 begin development normally but switch sex during the mid- to late-juvenile stage, becoming fertile males. We also demonstrate that estrogen production, mediated by the aromatase cyp19a1a, is necessary for female development and that Bmp15 function is linked to the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis via promoting the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle.

    Implications: Our findings provide the first mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate the maintenance of sex in zebrafish, revealing a novel role for Bmp15 in adult female sex differentiation. We propose a model in which the oocyte-somatic gonad interaction stabilizes cyp19a1a expression and estrogen production, determining female vs. male fate.

    Conclusions: Our study identifies Bmp15 as a critical regulator of adult female sex differentiation in zebrafish, highlighting the importance of oocyte-somatic gonad interaction in maintaining the female sexual phenotype. These findings contribute to our understanding of sex determination mechanisms in zebrafish and provide a framework for exploring conserved genetic pathways in other fish species.

    **Title:** Combinatorial Regulation of Hox Target Genes by Multiple Transcriptional Regulators

    **Research Question:** How do Hox proteins achieve high-regulatory specificity in controlling cell diversification and pattern formation along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals?

    **Methods:** We investigated the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) in Drosophila, using a combination of genetic and molecular biology techniques.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators, including Apt, Gcm, Ems, En, Slp1, Brk, Doc1, and Disco, on a minimal enhancer. This suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements (HREs) are responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of Hox target gene regulation in vivo. They suggest that a large number of transcription factors are directly involved in Hox target gene regulation, and that the ability of a broadly expressed Hox protein to regulate a target gene in a proper spatial and temporal context is achieved by the Hox-independent recruitment of context-specific transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences present in compact HREs.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of Hox target gene regulation and highlights the importance of combinatorial interactions between Hox proteins and other transcription factors in achieving high-regulatory specificity. These findings have important implications for our understanding of morphogenesis and the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to Hox protein dysregulation.

    Title: Unveiling the Genetic Requirements for ADR1-L2-Mediated Defense Responses in Arabidopsis thaliana

    Background: Plants employ a complex defense system to recognize and respond to pathogen attacks, involving the recognition of pathogen-specific molecules at the cell surface and inside the cell. The intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) sensor proteins, such as ADR1-L2, play a crucial role in monitoring pathogen effectors (virulence factors) and triggering defense responses.

    Research Question: What are the genetic requirements for ADR1-L2-mediated defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana?

    Methods: We generated an autoactive mutant of ADR1-L2, ADR1-L2D484V, which exhibits a dwarfed morphology and constitutively high salicylic acid (SA) levels. We used this allele as a proxy for canonical activation of ADR1-L2 in a series of epistasis experiments to define the genetic requirements for signaling.

    Main Findings: Our results show that ADR1-L2D484V signaling does not require NADPH oxidase and is negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1. Transcriptional regulation of ADR1-L2D484V is correlated with its phenotypic outputs, which are both SA-dependent and -independent. The genetic requirements for ADR1-L2D484V activity resemble those that regulate an SA-gradient-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell death signaling initially observed in the absence of LSD1.

    Implications: Our findings provide insight into an SA-dependent feedback regulation loop, which includes ADR1-L2. This loop is controlled by both EDS1 and SA in separable, but linked pathways. Our results support the model of redundant functions of EDS1 and SA in plant defense mediated by ‘sensor’ NB-LRR functions.

    Conclusions: We propose a genetic model that elucidates the genetic requirements for ADR1-L2-mediated defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings highlight the importance of ADR1-L2 in plant defense and provide a framework for understanding the complex interactions between SA, EDS1, and AtMC1 in regulating defense responses.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of RdDM Components in MORC6-Mediated Transcriptional Silencing in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** How do RdDM components interact with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis, and what is the relationship between DNA methylation and heterochromatin condensation in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed genetic analysis and biochemical assays to investigate the interactions between RdDM components (SUVH2, SUVH9, IDN2, Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2) and MORC6, a protein previously shown to mediate transcriptional silencing through heterochromatin condensation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that SUVH2 and SUVH9 can either act in the same pathway as MORC6 or synergistically with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. We also demonstrate that IDN2 interacts with MORC6 and mediates the silencing of a subset of MORC6 target loci. Furthermore, we show that other RdDM components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, are required for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. Notably, we found that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 and SUVH9, and mediate transcriptional silencing through heterochromatin condensation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that RdDM components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation, thereby enhancing transcriptional silencing at methylated genomic regions. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis and highlights the complex interplay between DNA methylation and heterochromatin condensation in this process.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that RdDM components interact with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis, and that this process is linked to heterochromatin condensation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of epigenetic regulation in plants and may have broader implications for the study of transcriptional silencing in other organisms.

    **Title:** Compromised Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) Function Reveals Cryptic Phenotypes in Flies and Plants: Implications for Vertebrate Developmental Anomalies

    **Research Question:** What is the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in buffering underlying genetic variation and modulating the severity or penetrance of developmental anomalies in vertebrates?

    **Methods:** We used zebrafish as a vertebrate model to investigate the effects of Hsp90 inhibition on developmental phenotypes. We defined Hsp90 inhibitor levels that did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains. We then analyzed the effects of Hsp90 inhibition on the severity of recessive eye phenotypes caused by pax6b and sufu mutations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that partial inhibition of Hsp90 function in zebrafish revealed previously unobserved specific developmental anomalies, including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia complex. Inbreeding of offspring from selected unaffected carrier parents led to significantly elevated malformation frequencies, revealing the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. In contrast to Drosophila, Hsp90 inhibition decreased developmental stability in zebrafish, as indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia and sunrise phenotypes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Hsp90 plays a crucial role in buffering underlying genetic variation and modulating the severity or penetrance of developmental anomalies in vertebrates. The results imply that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages may underpin the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies where the interaction between genotype and environment plays a major role.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of Hsp90 in maintaining developmental stability and modulating the severity of developmental anomalies. The findings have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the variable penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies in vertebrates. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular events that can alter the balance between cryptic and overt phenotypes.

    Title: Elucidating the Biological Function of N-Terminal Acetylation through the (X)PX Rule

    Background: N-terminal acetylation is a widespread protein modification that plays a crucial role in various biological processes across the tree of life. Despite its significance, the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylation remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the biological function of N-terminal acetylation in Drosophila Kc167 cells.

    Methods: We employed shotgun proteomics and COFRADIC enrichment to analyze the amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells. Our analysis revealed over 1,200 mature protein N-termini, demonstrating that N-terminal acetylation occurs with a similar frequency in insects as in humans.

    Main Findings: We identified the (X)PX rule as the sole determinant for N-terminal acetylation, which indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation. By expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and flies, we developed a generic assay to probe the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation.

    Implications: Our findings provide a straightforward strategy to systematically study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylations in cells and whole organisms. Since the (X)PX rule appears to be conserved across lower and higher eukaryotes, we propose that it can be applied to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.

    Conclusions: This study presents a comprehensive compilation of mature protein N-termini from Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 cells, demonstrating that N-terminal acetylation is a common protein modification in insects. The (X)PX rule provides a valuable tool for genetically modifying proteins to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation in various biological processes, and we propose that the (X)PX rule can be applied to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of RNA Polymerase III Termination and Its Link to Transcription Output

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular determinants of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) termination and how do they impact transcription output, particularly in the context of cellular proliferation, development, and cancer?

    **Methods:** We employed two tRNA-mediated suppression systems to screen for RNAP III mutants with gain- and loss-of-termination phenotypes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe). A total of 122 point mutations were mapped to the recently solved 3.9 Å structure of yeast RNAP III elongation complex (EC), revealing clusters in the active center bridge helix and trigger loop, as well as the pore and funnel.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including the C11 subunit, are key determinants of termination. Mutants with a readthrough (RT) phenotype exhibit increased elongation rates, supporting a kinetic coupling model where elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. Furthermore, we found that mutants with the RT phenotype synthesize more RNA than wild-type cells, both in vitro and in vivo, and that this increased activity is unrelated to the RNAP III repressor, Maf1.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of RNAP III termination and its link to transcription output. The data suggest that RNAP III has two modes of termination, a holoenzyme mode at short tracts of 5-7 Ts and a RNAP III-core mode that requires longer tracts of 8-9 Ts. The kinetic coupling model provides a framework for understanding the relationship between elongation rate and transcript production.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular determinants of RNAP III termination and its impact on transcription output. The results suggest that mutations in the active center mobile elements, including C11, can activate RNAP III for overall transcription, leading to increased RNA synthesis. These findings have implications for understanding the role of RNAP III in cellular proliferation, development, and cancer, and highlight the potential for RNAP III activation as an unforeseen mechanism of disease.

    Title: Predicting SH2-Mediated Protein-Protein Interactions: A Structure-Based Approach

    Research Question: Can we develop a method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm?

    Methods: We developed a method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions by combining the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes with the FoldX algorithm. We evaluated the performance of our approach by comparing it to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the FoldX algorithm performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. We used our method to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. We validated the predictions using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the FoldX algorithm is a useful alternative to peptide library experiments for the prediction of SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. The portability of this method to other SH2 domains remains to be shown, but our results demonstrate its applicability for genome-wide predictions. We propose that future prediction methods should account for both the biophysics and the biology of SH2 domains.

    Conclusions: We have developed a structure-based approach to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the FoldX algorithm. Our method performs as well as experimentally derived consensus sequences or position-specific substitution matrices in predicting in vitro SH2-phosphopeptide binding and in vivo SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. We provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure, which can be used as a resource for further experimental testing. Our results highlight the potential of structure-based methods for predicting protein-protein interactions and provide a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling.

    **Title:** Cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) Dissolves Tau Amyloids and Ameliorates Neurodegenerative Pathology in a Mouse Model of Tau Accumulation

    **Research Question:** Can cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), a cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase), dissolve tau amyloids and ameliorate neurodegenerative pathology in a mouse model of tau accumulation?

    **Methods:** We investigated the disaggregation activity of CyP40 on tau amyloids in vitro and in a mouse model of tau accumulation. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to analyze the interaction between CyP40 and tau, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the morphology of tau fibrils.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CyP40 dissolves tau amyloids in vitro and reduces silver-positive and oligomeric tau species in a mouse model of tau accumulation, preserving neuronal health and cognition. NMR spectroscopy revealed that CyP40 interacts with tau at sites rich in proline residues, and TEM imaging showed that CyP40 alters the morphology and reduces the size of tau fibrils. Furthermore, we found that CyP40 lacking PPIase activity prevents its capacity for disaggregation in vitro.

    **Implications:** Our study identifies CyP40 as a novel human protein disaggregase that can dissolve intracellular amyloids, including tau and α-syn. The procognitive effects of CyP40 overexpression in the tauopathic brain suggest that strategies to either induce or deliver disaggregases to the central nervous system could halt or even rescue cognitive deficits associated with neurotoxic amyloids.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of CyP40 as a therapeutic intervention for tauopathies and other amyloidogenic disorders. The unique structural properties of CyP40 may permit disaggregation to occur in an energy-independent manner, making it a promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of CyP40-mediated amyloid disaggregation and to explore its therapeutic potential.
Title: Elucidating Heterocyst Differentiation in Cyanobacteria Filaments through Systems Biology: A Theoretical Framework

Abstract:

Heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments is a paradigmatic example of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms. Despite extensive experimental studies on the evolution and maintenance of heterocyst patterns and the genetic circuit underlying single cyanobacterium behavior under nitrogen deprivation, a theoretical gap persists between these macroscopic and microscopic processes. To bridge this gap, we employ a systems biology approach to formulate the essential dynamical ingredients of the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium into a set of differential equations describing the time evolution of relevant molecular products. By simulating the behavior of a single cyanobacterium under different external conditions, emulating nitrogen deprivation, and coupling their respective genetic circuits via molecular diffusion, we elucidate the principles governing heterocyst pattern formation and sustainment. Our results demonstrate that incorporating both diffusion and noisy external conditions into the computational model enables the reproduction of the main features of heterocyst pattern formation and sustainment observed experimentally. This study highlights the importance of noise in the onset of differentiation and reveals that cyanobacteria filaments have developed an efficient response to noisy environmental conditions.

Methods:

We developed a simple mathematical model by integrating recent experimental results on the genetic regulatory network of cyanobacteria into the theoretical framework of systems biology. Our model connects the diffusion of combined nitrogen along the filament with the dynamical properties of the underlying genetic circuit of each single cyanobacterium, capturing both the development of heterocyst patterns and their maintenance.

Main Findings:

Our results show that the inclusion of diffusion and noisy external conditions in the computational model enables the reproduction of the main features of heterocyst pattern formation and sustainment observed experimentally. Furthermore, we demonstrate that noise plays a crucial role in the onset of differentiation, enabling the development of characteristic heterocyst patterns for a wide range of model parameters.

Implications:

This study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the principles governing heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments. Our results highlight the importance of noise in the onset of differentiation and reveal that cyanobacteria filaments have developed an efficient response to noisy environmental conditions. This work has implications for our understanding of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms.

Conclusions:

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the power of systems biology in elucidating the principles governing heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments. By incorporating diffusion and noisy external conditions into the computational model, we were able to reproduce the main features of heterocyst pattern formation and sustainment observed experimentally. This work highlights the importance of noise in the onset of differentiation and provides a theoretical framework for understanding cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms.

    Title: Exploring the Association between Perceptions of Onchocerciasis and Adherence to Ivermectin in Cameroon: A Cross-Sectional Survey

    Background: Onchocerciasis, a debilitating disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, remains a significant public health concern in Cameroon, despite over 15 years of mass treatment with ivermectin through the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program. This study aimed to investigate the association between people's perceptions of onchocerciasis and the CDTI program, and their adherence to ivermectin in three regions of Cameroon.

    Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three health districts with persistent high onchocerciasis prevalence. Participants were randomly selected in 30 clusters per district. Adherence to ivermectin was measured, and participants' perceptions of the CDTI program, disease representations, and misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission were assessed.

    Main Findings: Adherence to ivermectin was comparable between Bafang and Bafia (55.0% and 48.8%, respectively) and lower in Yabassi (40.7%). Perceptions of the CDTI program were the most determinant factor in adherence to ivermectin. People with a "not positive" opinion of ivermectin distribution campaigns were less compliant than those with a positive opinion (40% vs 55% in Bafang, and 48% vs 62% in Bafia, p < 0.01). Misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission, such as the lack of hygiene and high sugar intake, were prevalent, particularly in Bafia and Yabassi.

    Implications: This study highlights the importance of perceptions of the CDTI program in adherence to ivermectin. Local health authorities should prioritize education and sensitization on onchocerciasis and ivermectin use, as well as involve communities and encourage community distributors' work to improve adherence. Furthermore, addressing misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission is crucial to enhance the effectiveness of the CDTI program.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates that perceptions of the CDTI program and misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission are significant barriers to adherence to ivermectin in Cameroon. By addressing these factors, local health authorities can improve the effectiveness of the CDTI program and ultimately contribute to the elimination of onchocerciasis in Cameroon.

    **Title:** Investigating the Relative Contribution of Genetic and Epigenetic Variation to Disease-Related Protein Biomarkers

    **Background:** Epigenetic alterations have been linked to various diseases, but the causal relationship between epigenetic changes and disease pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation to protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease.

    **Methods:** We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) using DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 698 to 1033 samples. We measured 121 protein biomarkers and analyzed their associations with DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and over 10 million SNPs.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 124 and 45 loci associated with protein biomarkers in the EWAS and GWAS, respectively, with effect sizes up to 0.22 standard units per 1% change in DNA methylation levels and up to four standard units per copy of the effective allele. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory, whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one in NLRC5 associated with CXCL11, CXCL9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that DNA methylation has a limited direct effect on biomarkers of complex diseases. Instead, the associations between protein biomarkers and DNA methylation levels likely reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects of the pathogenesis of disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides insights into the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation to disease-related protein biomarkers. Our findings indicate that while genetic variants play a significant role in determining biomarker levels, epigenetic alterations have a limited direct effect on these biomarkers. These results have important implications for understanding the complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors in the development of complex diseases.

    **Title:** Varicella Zoster Virus Impairs Natural Killer Cell Function through Direct Contact and Modulation of Receptor Signaling

    **Research Question:** How does Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) affect the function of Natural Killer (NK) cells, a crucial component of the anti-viral immune response?

    **Methods:** We investigated the impact of VZV on NK cell function in vitro using a co-culture system, where NK cells were exposed to VZV-infected epithelial cells or cell-free VZV. We analyzed NK cell surface receptor expression, degranulation, cytokine production, and target cell lysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that VZV potently impairs NK cell function, leading to a loss of cytotoxic and cytokine responses. Notably, both VZV-infected NK cells and VZV-exposed NK cells exhibited impaired function, suggesting a direct effect of the virus on NK cells. The impairment was dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected cells. Profiling of NK cell surface receptors revealed stable expression, but perturbation of the degranulation signaling cascade was observed. Furthermore, VZV-infected NK cells were unable to respond to target cell stimulation, even when the stimulation signal bypassed receptor/ligand interactions and early signaling.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a previously unreported strategy employed by VZV to manipulate the immune response, highlighting the virus's ability to directly impair NK cell function. This mechanism of immune evasion has significant implications for our understanding of VZV pathogenesis and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that VZV can directly impair NK cell function, leading to a loss of cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This effect is mediated by direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected cells, and involves modulation of the degranulation signaling cascade. Our findings contribute to a growing understanding of pathogen inhibition of NK cell function and provide new insights into the immune evasion strategies employed by VZV.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Neural Mechanism of Apparent Motion: A Predictive Coding Perspective

    **Research Question:** What is the neural mechanism underlying apparent motion (AM) and how does it affect low-level visual processing?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of AM on the detection of grating stimuli presented along the AM path using a V1-like population code model of early visual processing. We found that AM impairs the detection of a target presented on the AM path when the target’s orientation matches the inducers’ orientation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of target gratings, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. This masking is strongest when the target orientation is identical to the orientation of the inducers. We also found that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to either cause masking or to be perceived as motion. Instead, our model predicts strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a central but hitherto unnoticed aspect of AM masking, namely the upper bound on detection performance. We identified orientation-tuned suppression of responses in early visual cortex as the major cause of AM masking, which can be explained by predictive coding models of cortical processing. These models propose that higher-level predictions of motion are generated, which “explain away” lower-level responses to expected sensory input.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that AM masking does not necessarily imply V1 activation, but rather can be explained by predictive coding models of visual processing. The presentation of AM inducers evokes responses in a subset of V1 cells, tuned to locations along the AM path and to the visual properties of these inducers. These evoked responses interfere with the responses to actual stimuli along the AM path, thus impairing the perception of these stimuli. Our study provides new insights into the neural mechanism of AM and highlights the importance of predictive coding models in understanding early visual processing.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Biochemical Mechanism of HTLV-1 Tax-Induced IKK Activation

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying biochemical mechanism by which the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax activates the IKK-NF-κB pathway, leading to CD4+ T cell transformation?

    **Methods:** We employed an in vitro cell-free system to reconstitute Tax-stimulated IKK activation and dissect the essential cellular components required for primary IKK activation by Tax.

    **Main Findings:** Our studies revealed that Tax, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzes the assembly of free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains in conjunction with UbcH2, UbcH5c, or UbcH7. These free polyubiquitin chains directly bind to the NEMO subunit of IKK, leading to its activation. This biochemical mechanism clarifies the confusion surrounding HTLV-1-induced IKK-NF-κB activation and identifies the essential cellular factors hijacked by HTLV-1.

    **Implications:** Understanding the biochemical function of Tax in IKK activation and the underlying molecular mechanism has significant implications for the development of therapeutics for Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL) and Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM).

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which HTLV-1 Tax activates the IKK-NF-κB pathway, a key event in CD4+ T cell transformation. By reconstituting Tax-stimulated IKK activation in a cell-free system, we have elucidated the biochemical function of Tax and identified the minimal cellular ubiquitination components required for IKK-NF-κB activation. These findings advance our understanding of HTLV-1-mediated transformation and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ATL and TSP/HAM.

    **Title:** Quantifying the Relationship between Propagule Pressure and Establishment Success of Alien Species: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between propagule pressure (the number of individuals introduced to found a population) and establishment success of alien species, and how does this relationship vary across different taxa, life histories, and study designs?

    **Methods:** We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 studies that evaluated the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success of alien species. We used Bayesian meta-analytical methods to estimate the overall effect of propagule pressure on establishment success and to test for heterogeneity in this relationship.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success across a broad range of taxa, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. However, establishment success was most critically dependent on propagule pressures in the range of 10-100 individuals. We found significant heterogeneity in effect size associated with different analytical approaches, with larger effect sizes observed in animal rather than plant introductions. In contrast, no variation was accounted for by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that propagule pressure is a critical determinant of establishment success for alien species, with a positive relationship observed across a wide range of taxa and life histories. However, the strength of this relationship varies depending on the analytical approach used, with animal introductions exhibiting larger effect sizes than plant introductions. These results have important implications for the management and control of invasive species, highlighting the need for careful consideration of propagule pressure in risk assessments and management strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our systematic review and meta-analysis provide the first quantitative evaluation of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success of alien species. Our results demonstrate remarkable consistency in the form of this relationship, with a positive effect of propagule pressure observed across a broad range of taxa and life histories. However, further research is needed to explore the sources of heterogeneity in effect size and to develop more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between propagule pressure and establishment success.

    **Title:** Interleukin 17A (IL-17) Modulates MicroRNA-16 (miR16) and AU-Rich Element-Binding Proteins (AUBps) to Regulate mRNA Decay

    **Research Question:** How does Interleukin 17A (IL-17) influence the regulation of mRNA decay by modulating the interaction between microRNA-16 (miR16) and AU-Rich Element-Binding Proteins (AUBps)?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of biochemical and molecular biology techniques to investigate the effects of IL-17 on miR16 and AUBps-mediated regulation of mRNA decay in human cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that IL-17 attenuates miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBps over destabilizing AUBps to target mRNAs, leading to reduced mRNA decay. We also demonstrate that miR16, independent of its seed sequence, directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBps for target mRNAs. Furthermore, we found that IL-17-induced inhibition of miR16 expression or inhibition of miR16 using complementary Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) resulted in attenuated mRNA degradation.

    **Implications:** These findings indicate that IL-17 modulates miR16 and AUBps to regulate mRNA decay, suggesting a novel mechanism by which IL-17 influences gene expression. Since AUBps affect approximately 8% of the human transcriptome and miR16 is ubiquitously expressed, IL-17 may impact many other cellular processes beyond inflammation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a complex interplay between IL-17, miR16, and AUBps in regulating mRNA decay, highlighting the importance of miR16 in directing the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBps for target mRNAs. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-17-mediated regulation of gene expression and have implications for understanding the role of IL-17 in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases.

    **Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Human T. b. rhodesiense Infection and T. brucei s. l. Circulating in Cattle at Village Level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and T. brucei s. l. circulating in cattle at village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda?

    **Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in villages that had reported a case of sleeping sickness in the six months prior to sample collection (case villages) and those that had never reported a case of sleeping sickness (non-case villages). Blood samples were collected from cattle in these villages to determine the prevalence of T. brucei s. l. (both non-human infective T. b. brucei and human infective T. b. rhodesiense).

    **Main Findings:** The study found a significant association between the sleeping sickness status of a village and the odds of T. brucei s. l. infection in cattle. Cattle from case villages had higher odds of T. brucei s. l. infection than those from non-case villages (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.38-6.24). Additionally, cattle age had a significant effect on the likelihood of T. brucei s. l. infection, with cattle between 18-36 months and over 36 months having significantly higher odds of infection than cattle under 18 months of age. Furthermore, village human sleeping sickness status had a significant effect on the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle herd, with significantly higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle of case villages (OR: 25, 95% CI: 1.2-520.71).

    **Implications:** The findings of this study suggest that a high village-level prevalence of T. brucei s. l. in cattle is associated with a higher likelihood of detecting T. b. rhodesiense in a herd. This could provide a useful means of determining risk at village or parish level in endemic districts in Uganda. Establishing the extent of the reservoir of human infective T. b. rhodesiense parasites in cattle not only provides an indicator of risk to the human population in the affected districts but also permits appraisal of the risk of the disease spreading to neighbouring districts.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between infected cattle and infected individuals in order to develop an appropriate response to the risk posed to the community from animals infected with human pathogens in a village setting.

    **Title:** The MOF-Containing NSL Complex Regulates Housekeeping Genes in Drosophila by Modulating Pol II Transcription Initiation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the MOF-containing NSL complex in regulating gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster?

    **Methods:** We performed a comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NSL complex members (NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2) throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We also performed ChIP-seq analyses of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in NSL1- and NSL3-depleted cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the majority (85.5%) of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. We found that NSL-targeted genes exhibit increased abundance of histone modifications H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in gene promoter regions, as well as a well-defined nucleosome-free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSL proteins are required for efficient recruitment of Pol II to NSL target gene promoters, and that the observed Pol II reduction coincides with compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the MOF-containing NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription. The NSL complex preferentially targets genes that are constitutively expressed, also referred to as housekeeping genes, and exhibits elevated levels of H3K4me2/3, H3K9ac, and H4K16ac.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the role of the NSL complex in regulating gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. The MOF-containing NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription. Our findings have implications for understanding transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes and the evolutionary plasticity of the NSL complex. Further studies are needed to elucidate the principles that direct NSL targeting and to understand the conservation of the NSL complex from Drosophila to mammals.

    Title: Generation and Characterization of Transgenic Mice Modeling Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD)

    Background: Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor. The most common form of FSHD (FSHD1) is caused by a contraction of the D4Z4 array to fewer than 10 repeats, leading to variegated expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle.

    Research Question: Can transgenic mice carrying D4Z4 arrays from an FSHD1 allele and a control allele recapitulate the epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls?

    Methods: We generated two transgenic mouse lines: one carrying a D4Z4 genomic region from a contracted pathogenic FSHD1 allele (D4Z4-2.5) and one carrying a normal-sized, non-pathogenic allele (D4Z4-12.5). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA methylation analyses to assess epigenetic silencing of DUX4.

    Main Findings: Our data suggest that somatic epigenetic silencing of DUX4 is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, and contracted D4Z4 repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle nuclei. ChIP and DNA methylation analyses indicate a relative chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 repeats in D4Z4-2.5 mice compared to D4Z4-12.5 mice, concordant with the observed DUX4 expression pattern.

    Implications: These transgenic mice accurately model the difference between FSHD patients and control individuals and will be a valuable resource to study the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD and to test new therapeutic intervention strategies targeting DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the detrimental effects of DUX4 expression in mouse muscle can be reversed by RNA interference, suggesting that our model may also serve well for therapeutic intervention studies. The FSHD-specific somatic derepression of DUX4 has been associated with changes in D4Z4 chromatin structure, characterized by decreased DNA methylation and a lower ChCS. Our data suggest that the regulation of DUX4 expression is a locus-intrinsic property of the D4Z4 repeat array, conserved between mouse and human muscle.

    **Title:** Structural Basis of Cross-Strain Invasion Inhibition by Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) Vaccines

    **Research Question:** Can a vaccine containing diverse allelic proteins of Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) induce broadly inhibitory antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum parasites?

    **Methods:** We generated a vaccine, AMA1 Quadvax (QV), containing four diverse allelic proteins (3D7, FVO, HB3, and W2mef) and evaluated its ability to induce polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. We compared the inhibitory activity of these antibodies against four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of P. falciparum.

    **Main Findings:** QV elicited polyclonal antibodies that inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of P. falciparum, with higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against QV reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1e-loop. mAbs binding to the 1e-loop region (1B10, 4E8, and 4E11) were ∼10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA1-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA1 binding to its ligand RON2. Another novel mAb, 1E10, which bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that vaccination with a few diverse antigenic proteins can provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes. The novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes identified here can form the basis for improving the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the structural basis of cross-strain invasion inhibition by AMA1 vaccines and highlights the potential of QV to induce broadly inhibitory antibodies against P. falciparum parasites. These findings have significant implications for the development of second-generation AMA1 vaccines that can provide universal protection against malaria.

    **Title:** A Conserved Mechanism for Timing Mitotic Spindle Displacement in Asymmetric Cell Division

    **Research Question:** How is the displacement of the mitotic spindle precisely timed during asymmetric cell division in animal cells?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of quantitative measurements, genetic, reverse genetic, and pharmacological techniques to investigate the relationship between the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), and mitotic spindle displacement in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the APC, its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, and CDK comprise a previously unrecognized timer for spindle displacement. We found that reducing the function of the proteasome, APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CDK in prometaphase caused the spindle to displace early. Furthermore, we show that the delay in spindle displacement is essential for ensuring that the spindle is fully assembled before it begins to move.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that the timing of spindle displacement is precisely regulated in the C. elegans zygote, and that the APC-dependent negative regulation of CDK serves as a timer for spindle displacement. This regulation results in a delay of approximately 60-90 seconds in spindle displacement, allowing spindle assembly to complete before cortical forces pull the spindle away from the center of the cell.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide the first demonstration that mitotic progression times spindle displacement in the asymmetric division of an animal cell. We speculate that this link between the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division might be evolutionarily conserved, as the mitotic spindle is displaced at a similar stage of mitosis during asymmetric cell divisions in diverse systems. Our study highlights the importance of precise timing in mitotic spindle displacement and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying asymmetric cell division.

    **Title:** Genetic Adaptation to High-Altitude Hypoxia in Andeans and Tibetans: A Genome Scan Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Andean and Tibetan populations?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia in two high-altitude populations, the Andeans and Tibetans. We applied four population genetic statistics to detect signatures of natural selection and identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in each population separately. We also examined groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Notably, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans, but with differing patterns of variation between the two populations. We also identified several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, as well as several different chromosomal regions implicated in the putative response to selection.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provide a basis for future genotype-phenotype association studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude. Our results contribute to the understanding of the genetic and evolutionary architecture of adaptation to altitude and provide deeper insight into the genes responsible for human phenotypic diversity.

    **Conclusions:** By comparing and contrasting two human populations who have adapted to life at altitude, we have characterized the genetic mechanisms responsible for adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. Our study provides a foundation for future research to elucidate the genotype-phenotype relationship between specific genes and corresponding high-altitude phenotypes, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the genetic basis of human adaptation to high-altitude environments.

    **Title:** Inverted DNA Repeats Induce Genomic Instability by Channeling Double Strand Break Repair into Break-Induced Replication

    **Research Question:** How do inverted DNA repeats (IRs) influence the choice and outcome of double strand break (DSB) repair, and what are the implications for genomic stability?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of IRs on DSB repair using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays. We introduced IRs near a DSB site in yeast cells and analyzed the repair outcomes using techniques such as PCR, sequencing, and microscopy.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that IRs can channel DSB repair from the accurate gene conversion pathway to the break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, leading to genetic instability. We found that IRs can form two types of unusual DNA structures: inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to inverted dimers, and intra-molecular SSA leading to fold-back (FB) structures. The choice between these structures depends on the length of the spacer separating the IRs. IRs separated by a long (1-kb) spacer are predominantly involved in inter-molecular SSA, while IRs separated by a short (12-bp) spacer participate in intra-molecular SSA.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that IRs can induce genomic instability by promoting BIR, a deleterious DSB repair mechanism that can lead to chromosomal rearrangements. We also identified different protein complexes that participate in the processing of FBs containing short (12-bp) versus long (1-kb) ssDNA loops. Specifically, FBs with short loops are processed by the MRX-Sae2 complex, while FBs with long loops are processed by the Rad1-Rad10 complex.

    **Conclusions:** Our studies uncover the mechanisms of genomic destabilization resulting from re-routing DSB repair into unusual pathways by IRs. Given the high abundance of IRs in the human genome, our findings may contribute to the understanding of IR-mediated genomic destabilization associated with human disease. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the choice of DSB repair pathways and the role of IRs in promoting genomic instability.

    **Title:** In Vivo Modeling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Infections in Drosophila melanogaster

    **Research Question:** Can Drosophila melanogaster be used as a model organism to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo, and what are the key factors involved in biofilm formation and host-pathogen interactions?

    **Methods:** We developed an in vivo model of P. aeruginosa biofilm infection in Drosophila melanogaster by orally infecting flies with P. aeruginosa strains PAO1, PAZHI3, and a pelB::lux mutant. Biofilms were visualized and characterized in dissected Drosophila crops, and antibiotic resistance was assessed.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in vivo in the Drosophila crop, exhibiting a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. Biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes, as a pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilms. The pelB::lux mutant was significantly more virulent than PAO1, while a hyperbiofilm strain (PAZHI3) demonstrated significantly less virulence. Biofilm formation was associated with the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression, including diptericin, cecropin A1, and drosomycin.

    **Implications:** These findings provide novel insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aeruginosa oral infection of Drosophila and highlight the use of Drosophila as an infection model for studying P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo. Our results suggest that biofilm formation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections, and that the pel exopolysaccharide genes play a crucial role in biofilm formation and virulence.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the utility of Drosophila as a model organism for studying P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo. Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of biofilm formation and host-pathogen interactions, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating P. aeruginosa infections.

    Title: Investigating the Genomic Mechanisms of Vasopressin Receptor 1a Gene Expression in Voles and Mice

    Research Question: What are the genomic mechanisms that contribute to the remarkable differences in vasopressin receptor 1a (V1aR) expression patterns in voles and mice, and how do these differences impact behavior?

    Methods: We used homologous recombination in mice to investigate the contribution of the proximal 5′ flanking region and a polymorphic microsatellite element within the vole Avpr1a gene to V1aR distribution and behavior. We also generated transgenic mice carrying the prairie vole Avpr1a locus to examine the effects of Avpr1a expression on behavior.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the proximal 5′ flanking region contributes modestly to species differences in V1aR distribution, and that variation in V1aR distribution impacts stress-coping behavior in the forced swim test. We also found that the vole Avpr1a microsatellite structure contributes to Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring a subset of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles.

    Implications: Our study provides the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles, offering a mechanism for generating behavioral diversity both at the individual and species level. However, our results suggest that many features of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5′ flanking region of the gene.

    Conclusions: The vole Avpr1a gene is an ideal model locus for exploring the genomic mechanisms contributing to diversity in brain gene expression and behavior. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both species-specific regulatory elements in the 5′ flanking region and polymorphic repetitive elements in generating species-specific patterns and individual variation in brain gene expression. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of behavior and the role of genetic variation in shaping brain function.

    **Title:** Mechanisms of Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID)-Mediated Genome Instability: Insights from a Yeast Chromosomal System

    **Research Question:** How do Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID)-mediated R-loops and mRNP biogenesis impairment contribute to genome instability, including class switch recombination (CSR) and chromosomal translocations?

    **Methods:** We developed a yeast chromosomal system to analyze chromosomal rearrangements in both wild-type and THO mutants, a conserved nuclear complex involved in mRNP biogenesis. We used different segments of mammalian S regions and c-MYC for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that AID acts in yeast at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs), which in turn cause chromosomal translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). AID-induced translocations were strongly enhanced in yeast THO null mutants, consistent with the idea that AID-mediated DSBs depend on R-loop formation. Our data suggest that AID-mediated deamination of cytosines at S sequences in yeast are channeled by the Ung1 activity into DSBs as occurs in mammalian B cells, which are then repaired by NHEJ.

    **Implications:** Our study provides new clues to understand the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability. We show that yeast cells, as mammalian B cells, have the factors and pathways required to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and CSR.

    **Conclusions:** Our model yeast system provides a validated assay to study the molecular mechanisms mediated by AID leading to DSBs at S regions and the c-MYC oncogene, such as those occurring in B cells responsible for class switching or the Ig/myc translocations that are associated with Burkitt's lymphomas. This study opens new perspectives in understanding AID-mediated rearrangements and highlights the importance of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome instability.

    **Title:** Repositioning of Chromosomes during Asymmetric Cell Division in Escherichia coli

    **Research Question:** How do Escherichia coli cells coordinate chromosome replication and cell division when the cell division plane is not properly localized?

    **Methods:** We employed quantitative time-lapse imaging and fluorescence microscopy to investigate chromosome partitioning in E. coli cells with asymmetrically placed cell division planes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that DNA translocase, FtsK, can pump up to 80% (3.7 Mb) of the chromosome between daughters at an average rate of 1700±800 bp/s. Pauses in DNA translocation are rare, and we did not observe reversals at experimental time scales of a few minutes. The majority of DNA movement occurs at the latest stages of cell division, when the cell division protein ZipA has already dissociated from the septum, and the septum has closed to a narrow channel with a diameter much smaller than the resolution limit of the microscope (~250 nm). Our data suggest that the narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that E. coli cells are capable of repositioning their chromosomes when their cell division plane is not properly localized, which challenges the commonly accepted view that E. coli coordinates cell division and chromosome replication through accurate positioning of the cell division apparatus relative to the nucleoids.

    **Conclusions:** Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of chromosome partitioning in E. coli cells with asymmetrically placed cell division planes. The ability of FtsK to pump large amounts of DNA between daughters suggests that this protein plays a crucial role in repositioning chromosomes during cell division. Our results also imply that the narrow constriction of the septum is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK, and that DNA located within the constriction realizes a cell-cycle checkpoint that prevents daughters from separating from each other. These findings have important implications for our understanding of bacterial cell division and chromosome replication.
Title: Optimal Epitope Selection for Epitope-Based Vaccines: A Mathematical Framework Using Integer Linear Programming

    Abstract:
    The development of epitope-based vaccines (EVs) is a promising approach for therapeutic and prophylactic applications, including infectious diseases and cancer. However, the selection of optimal epitopes is a complex optimization problem due to the polymorphic nature of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and the limited number of epitopes that can be included in an EV. To address this challenge, we present a mathematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) that efficiently identifies optimal sets of epitopes for EVs. Our framework selects the set of epitopes with the maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by translating common immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates, into constraints or modifications of the objective function within the ILP framework. Our implementation outperforms a simple greedy strategy and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm, with runtimes on the order of seconds for typical problem sizes. This work provides a novel and efficient solution to the vaccine design problem for EVs, enabling the development of more effective and personalized vaccines.

    Research Question:
    What is the optimal set of epitopes for an epitope-based vaccine that maximizes overall immunogenicity while satisfying various immunological requirements?

    Methods:
    We developed a mathematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) to select the optimal set of epitopes from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. The framework incorporates various immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates, as constraints or modifications of the objective function.

    Main Findings:
    Our ILP approach outperforms a simple greedy strategy and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm, with runtimes on the order of seconds for typical problem sizes. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by translating common immunological requirements into constraints or modifications of the objective function within the ILP framework.

    Implications:
    Our work provides a novel and efficient solution to the vaccine design problem for EVs, enabling the development of more effective and personalized vaccines. The ILP framework can be used to select the optimal set of epitopes for various applications, including infectious diseases and cancer.

    Conclusions:
    We present a mathematical framework based on ILP that efficiently identifies optimal sets of epitopes for EVs. Our approach provides a flexible and efficient solution to the vaccine design problem, enabling the development of more effective and personalized vaccines. The ILP framework can be used to select the optimal set of epitopes for various applications, including infectious diseases and cancer.

    **Title:** Interleukin-7 Facilitates HIV-1 Vaginal Transmission by Enhancing Virus Replication in Cervico-Vaginal and Lymphoid Tissues

    **Research Question:** Does interleukin-7 (IL-7) play a role in facilitating HIV-1 vaginal transmission by enhancing virus replication in cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissues?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effect of IL-7 on HIV-1 vaginal transmission using an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue. We simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations comparable with those measured in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals.

    **Main Findings:** We found that IL-7 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues showed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion by preventing apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased expression of the apoptotic marker APO2.7 and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells, as shown by staining for the nuclear factor Ki-67.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that high levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may be relevant to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study is the first to address the role of IL-7 in HIV-1 male-to-female transmission. Our findings demonstrate that exposure of cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissues ex vivo to IL-7 at concentrations comparable with those found in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals facilitates HIV-1 infection. These results have significant implications for our understanding of HIV-1 transmission and suggest that IL-7 may play a critical role in facilitating HIV-1 vaginal transmission.

    Title: Elucidating Zika Virus-Mosquito RNA Interference Interactions in Aedes aegypti Cells

    Background: RNA interference (RNAi) plays a crucial role in controlling arbovirus infections in mosquitoes. Two distinct RNAi pathways, the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and exogenous short interfering RNA (exo-siRNA) pathways, are involved in antiviral responses. The exo-siRNA pathway is considered the key mosquito antiviral response mechanism.

    Research Question: What are the roles of the piRNA and exo-siRNA pathways in controlling Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in Aedes aegypti cells?

    Methods: We investigated the production of virus-specific siRNAs and piRNAs in ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti cells. We also examined the involvement of the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and PIWI proteins in the antiviral response.

    Main Findings: Our results show that ZIKV induces the production of virus-specific siRNAs and piRNA-like molecules in Aedes aegypti cells. However, these piRNA-like molecules lack the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and are bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of Ago3, Piwi5, or Piwi6 did not enhance ZIKV replication, whereas silencing of Piwi4 displayed antiviral activity. Furthermore, we found that the expression of ZIKV capsid protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but unlike yellow fever virus capsid protein, it does not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the exo-siRNA pathway plays a crucial role in controlling ZIKV infections in Aedes aegypti cells. The production of virus-specific siRNAs and the involvement of Ago2 in the antiviral response indicate that the exo-siRNA pathway is a key component of the mosquito antiviral response.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the interactions between ZIKV and the RNAi response of Aedes aegypti cells. Our results highlight the importance of the exo-siRNA pathway in controlling ZIKV infections and have implications for understanding the spread of ZIKV in mosquito populations.

    **Title:** Species-Specific Clinical Manifestations of Sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: A Cross-Sectional Study

    **Background:** Sporotrichosis, caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii, is a zoonotic disease with variable clinical manifestations. Recent taxonomic changes have led to the recognition of Sporothrix brasiliensis as a distinct species. This study aimed to investigate the association between Sporothrix species and clinical aspects of sporotrichosis in an endemic area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

    **Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis. Sporothrix isolates were analyzed using phenotypic and genotypic methods to identify the species associated with each clinical presentation.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed distinct clinical pictures and therapeutic responses in patients infected with Sporothrix brasiliensis (n=45) compared to those infected with Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto (n=5). Sporothrix brasiliensis was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection, whereas Sporothrix schenckii presented with less severe and more localized disease. Notably, patients infected with Sporothrix brasiliensis required shorter durations of itraconazole treatment (median 16 weeks) compared to those infected with Sporothrix schenckii (median 24 weeks).

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis, and that Sporothrix brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. This study highlights the importance of careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical care.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates an association between genotypic identification of Sporothrix species and several clinical aspects of human sporotrichosis, providing new insights into the clinical implications of recent taxonomic changes. The results support the careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical management and treatment of sporotrichosis.

Title: Reassessing the Extent of Transcription in the Mammalian Genome: A Comparative Analysis of RNA-Seq and Tiling Arrays

Background: Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed beyond annotated genes. However, the quantity and nature of these additional transcripts remain unclear.

Research Question: What is the extent and composition of transcripts in human and mouse tissues, as revealed by single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays?

Methods: We analyzed PolyA+ RNA from human and mouse tissues using RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts.

Main Findings: Our results indicate that RNA-Seq identifies fewer transcribed regions (seqfrags) outside known exons and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) compared to tiling arrays. Most non-exonic seqfrags are located within introns, suggesting they may be fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of intergenic seqfrags are often near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. We identified 4,544 new exons affecting 3,554 genes through reads that bridge splice sites.

Implications: Our findings suggest that while there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance are generally low compared to known exons. The genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.

Conclusions: Our comparative analysis of RNA-Seq and tiling arrays reveals that tiling arrays are ill-suited to accurately detect transcripts expressed at low levels. The majority of non-exonic transcripts in RNA-Seq data are associated with known genes, including thousands of new alternative exons and hundreds of alternative promoters. Our results provide a more nuanced understanding of the mammalian transcriptome, highlighting the importance of RNA-Seq for accurately detecting low-abundance transcripts.
Title: Enhancing Thermostability of the Flavin Mononucleotide-Based Fluorescent Protein Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV Domain through a Combined Computational and Experimental Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: The development of thermostable proteins is crucial for various biotechnological applications, particularly in thermophilic systems. The Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain, a flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein, exhibits moderate thermostability, limiting its applicability in high-temperature environments.

    Research Question: Can a combined computational and experimental method be developed to enhance the thermostability of the Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain, thereby expanding its utility in thermophilic systems?

    Methods: A five-step approach was employed, consisting of single mutant computer screening, experimental evaluation, computational redesign, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination.

    Main Findings: The combined method successfully increased the thermostability of the Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain by 31°C, resulting in a melting temperature (Tm) of 54.2°C. Computational screening identified eight thermostable sites, with five located at the dimeric interface, highlighting the importance of inter-subunit interactions in enhancing thermostability. The V120I mutant exhibited the highest thermostability, with a Tm of 54.2°C.

    Implications: The developed method offers a novel tool for improving protein thermostability, particularly in cases where conventional methods, such as directed evolution, fail. The success rate of 62% underscores the effectiveness of computational screening in identifying thermostable mutants.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of a combined computational and experimental approach in enhancing the thermostability of the Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain.

    Title: Molecular Characterization of Sand Fly Species and Leishmania Infection in the Panama Canal Watershed: Implications for Leishmaniasis Control

    Background: Leishmaniasis, a protozoan disease transmitted by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia, poses a significant health threat to residents, tourists, and researchers in the Panama Canal watershed. To develop effective control strategies, it is essential to identify the sand fly species present, their evolutionary relationships, and their infection status with Leishmania and Wolbachia, a cytoplasmically transmitted rickettsia.

    Methods: We collected and sorted sand flies from the understory of Barro Colorado Island in the Republic of Panama and used DNA sequencing to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae species. We employed CO1, ITS-1, and "minicircle" primers to detect Leishmania DNA and Wolbachia infection in the sand fly species.

    Main Findings: Our results revealed 18 morphology-based species determinations, including two possible "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis and Lu. gomezi. Leishmania DNA was detected in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi, and 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. The ITS-1 sequence obtained from the Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi was identical and 93% similar to Leishmania (viannia) naiffi, a species previously unknown in Panama. Distinct strains of Wolbachia were detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species. The presence of Le. naiffi in Panama opens the possibility that its range has recently expanded to include the Isthmus or that it occurs as a recent introduction. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of molecular characterization of sand fly species and Leishmania infection in the Panama Canal watershed. Our results provide critical information for building strategies to mitigate the impact of leishmaniasis in humans and underscore the need for further geographic surveys of sand flies across the Isthmus using molecular methods of detection and sequence comparison.
Title: ERK-Mediated Reactivation of Human Cytomegalovirus in Dendritic Cells Requires CREB-Dependent MSK Recruitment and Histone H3 Phosphorylation

    Abstract:

    Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) is a significant clinical concern, underscoring the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process.

    Research Question: What is the role of the mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK) family in HCMV reactivation in DCs, and how does CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP) contribute to this process?

    Methods: We employed an adenovirus vector approach to investigate the relationship between ERK-MSK signaling, CREB binding to the MIEP, and histone H3 phosphorylation in the context of HCMV latency and reactivation in DCs.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that MSK-mediated reactivation of HCMV is dependent on CREB binding to the MIEP, which provides a target for MSK recruitment. Furthermore, MSK-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency.

    Implications: These findings suggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is essential for the recruitment of MSK kinase activity, initiating chromatin remodeling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Moreover, specific inhibition of the interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a therapeutic strategy for preventing HCMV reactivation.

    Conclusions: Our study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCMV reactivation in DCs, highlighting the critical role of CREB-dependent MSK recruitment and histone H3 phosphorylation in promoting chromatin modifications conducive to viral gene expression. These findings have significant implications for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting HCMV reactivation.

    **Title:** NOL11 is Essential for Vertebrate Ribosome Biogenesis and Craniofacial Development

    **Research Question:** What is the role of NOL11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology and developmental biology techniques to investigate the function of NOL11 in ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development. Specifically, we used Xenopus laevis as a model organism to knockdown NOL11 expression and analyze the effects on pre-rRNA transcription and processing, apoptosis, and craniofacial cartilage development.

    **Main Findings:** We found that NOL11 is strongly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest (CNC) of both amphibians and mammals, and is essential for optimal pre-rRNA transcription and processing in Xenopus. Knockdown of NOL11 resulted in impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of craniofacial cartilages. Inhibition of p53 rescued the craniofacial phenotype, but not the underlying ribosome biogenesis defect, indicating an evolutionarily conserved control mechanism that removes ribosome-impaired craniofacial cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel requirement for NOL11 in craniofacial development and provide further insight into the clinically important relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis proteins and craniofacial cell survival. The identification of NOL11 as a critical regulator of ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development has significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ribosomopathies, a growing class of inherited disorders characterized by defects in ribosome biogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates a critical function for NOL11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development, and provides the first frog model of a ribosomopathy. Our findings highlight the importance of NOL11 in regulating CNC survival and development, and provide new insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that control ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development.
Title: Identification of Novel Serodiagnostic Antigens for Leptospirosis Using a Protein Microarray Approach

    Abstract:
    Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira interrogans, poses a significant diagnostic challenge due to the lack of an adequate laboratory test, particularly during the early stages of illness. To address this issue, we employed a protein microarray approach to identify novel serodiagnostic antigens for leptospirosis. We constructed a protein microarray chip comprising 61% of the L. interrogans proteome and investigated the IgG response from 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent-phase patients, and 114 healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis. Our results revealed 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Notably, several novel antigens were identified, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. Our study provides the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptospiral infection and identifies novel serodiagnostic leptospiral antigens recognized by antibodies in the sera of leptospirosis cases. These novel antigens may have potential use in the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing this neglected tropical disease. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.

    Methods:
    We constructed a protein microarray chip comprising 2,421 proteins (61% of the L. interrogans proteome) and investigated the IgG response from 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent-phase patients, and 114 healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis. A nitrocellulose line blot assay was performed to validate the accuracy of the protein microarray results.

    Main Findings:
    Our results revealed 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Notably, several novel antigens were identified, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients.

    Implications:
    Our study provides the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptospiral infection and identifies novel serodiagnostic leptospiral antigens recognized by antibodies in the sera of leptospirosis cases. These novel antigens may have potential use in the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing this neglected tropical disease.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a protein microarray approach to identify novel serodiagnostic antigens for leptospirosis. The novel antigens identified in this study may have potential use in the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing this neglected tropical disease. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Melanization in Mosquito Defense Against Entomopathogenic Fungi: A Functional Genetic Analysis in Anopheles gambiae

    Abstract:

    Background: Mosquito immunity against entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana, remains poorly understood, despite their ubiquity and unique invasion route that bypasses the midgut epithelium. We investigated the role of melanization, a potent immune effector mechanism in arthropods, in Anopheles gambiae defense against B. bassiana using in vivo functional genetic analysis and confocal microscopy.

    Research Question: What is the role of melanization in Anopheles gambiae defense against Beauveria bassiana?

    Methods: We used a GFP-expressing strain of B. bassiana to facilitate microscopic analysis of fungal growth in adult A. gambiae mosquitoes. We monitored fungal growth in mosquitoes injected with B. bassiana conidia and silenced TEP1 and CLIPA8, key positive regulators of Plasmodium and bacterial melanization in A. gambiae.

    Main Findings: Melanin formed on all stages of B. bassiana, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae, except single-cell hyphal bodies. However, melanization rarely aborted fungal growth, and the mycelium continued growing despite being melanized. Silencing TEP1 and CLIPA8 abolished melanin formation on hyphae but not on germinating conidia or germ tubes. Microscopic analysis revealed that melanization of early fungal stages is cell-mediated, while that of late stages is a humoral response dependent on TEP1 and CLIPA8.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the mosquito melanization response retards B. bassiana growth and dissemination, which may be exploited to design transgenic fungi with more potent bio-control activities against mosquitoes.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the role of melanization in Anopheles gambiae defense against entomopathogenic fungi. Our results demonstrate that melanization plays a significant role in retarding B. bassiana growth and dissemination, and that TEP1 and CLIPA8 are key regulators of this response. These findings have important implications for the development of novel bio-control strategies against mosquitoes.

    **Title:** Inhibition of Dengue Virus Host Factors in the Mosquito Vector Aedes aegypti using Chemical Inhibitors and RNA Interference

    **Research Question:** Can known mammalian Dengue virus host factors (DENV HFs) inhibitors be used to block DENV infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti?

    **Methods:** We evaluated the potency of four DENV HF inhibitors, bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), in blocking DENV infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using various treatment methods, including direct injection, ingestion by sugar feeding or blood feeding, and RNA interference (RNAi).

    **Main Findings:** Injection of BAF (5 µM) and MPA (25 µM) prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV titers in the midgut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60%, respectively, and in the salivary gland at 14 days post-infection by 90% and 83%, respectively. Ingestion of BAF and MPA through a sugar meal or together with an infectious blood meal also resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNAi-mediated silencing of vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene resulted in a reduced DENV infection, indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition in adult mosquitoes most likely occurred through the inhibition of these DENV HFs.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide proof-of-principle that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of the DENV HFs vATPase and IMPDH can be used to suppress DENV infection of adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which may translate to a reduction in DENV transmission.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of using known mammalian DENV HF inhibitors to block DENV infection in the mosquito vector, highlighting the importance of vATPase and IMPDH as druggable targets for DENV transmission blocking. Our results suggest that the route and timing of BAF and MPA administration are critical, and treatment after exposure to the virus diminishes the antiviral effect of these compounds. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies against DENV.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Role of Cell Volume in Neuronal Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Seizures, Spreading Depression, and Anoxic Depolarization

    **Research Question:** How does cell volume affect neuronal dynamics, particularly in the context of pathological states such as epileptic seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel approach by incorporating cell swelling, dynamic ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics to investigate the effects of cell volume on neuronal behavior.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that cell volume acts as a bifurcation parameter, enabling the spontaneous transition between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states in response to changes in osmotic pressure. We identified a dynamical definition for the experimentally described physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. Our model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provides novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane, which can be understood only when dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure are taken into consideration. This unified framework may be of substantial importance in the understanding of and potentially developing universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of cell volume in neuronal dynamics, shedding light on the complex interplay between cell swelling, ion concentrations, and oxygen supply in the context of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. Our results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these debilitating conditions, and highlight the importance of considering the dynamic interplay between cell volume, ion concentrations, and oxygen homeostasis in understanding neuronal behavior.
Title: Activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome and IL-1β Signaling in Response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Infection

    Abstract:
    Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America, caused by the primary fungal pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (P. brasiliensis). The role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in host defense against P. brasiliensis infection is not well understood. Here, we investigated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β signaling in response to P. brasiliensis infection in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages. Our results show that P. brasiliensis yeast cells induce IL-1β production in BMDCs through a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), caspase-1, and NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member NLRP3-dependent manner. We also found that P. brasiliensis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation is dependent on potassium (K+) efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin B release. Furthermore, using mice lacking the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), we demonstrated that IL-1β signaling plays a crucial role in killing P. brasiliensis by murine macrophages. These findings suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses and responds to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection and plays an important role in host defense against this fungus. Future studies should investigate the protective role of IL-1R1 and NLRP3 inflammasome components against P. brasiliensis infection in vivo and determine how IL-1β activates macrophages for enhanced killing activity in vitro.

    **Title:** Toxoplasma gondii Preferentially Interacts with Neurons in the Central Nervous System

    **Background:** Toxoplasma gondii, a common brain-tropic parasite, infects most nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons, in vitro. However, in vivo, Toxoplasma is predominantly found in neurons. Recent in vitro data suggest that neurons may be persistently infected due to their inability to clear intracellular parasites.

    **Research Question:** Do neurons serve as the primary target cells for Toxoplasma gondii infection in the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model that allows for the marking and tracking of host cells interacting with parasites, even if the interaction is transient. We used two genetically divergent Toxoplasma-Cre strains to infect mice and analyzed the interactions between Toxoplasma and host cells in the CNS.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Toxoplasma exhibits a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, even in the presence of interferon-γ depletion, infection with parasites resistant to astrocyte-mediated clearance, or direct injection into the brain. Notably, neurons consistently comprised the majority of GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells, regardless of time point or infecting strain.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather serve as the primary in vivo target cells for Toxoplasma gondii. This understanding of host cell-pathogen dynamics has significant implications for the development of therapies to eliminate persistent pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides conclusive evidence that neurons are the primary target cells for Toxoplasma gondii infection in the CNS. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of Toxoplasma infection and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this ubiquitous intracellular parasite.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Lamellipodial Motility: A Minimal Model of Actin-Myosin Contractility

    **Research Question:** How do minimal free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility govern the shapes and movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility?

    **Methods:** We employed a systematic analysis of a minimal actin-myosin contractility model, accounting for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The model consisted of the force-balance and myosin transport equations.

    **Main Findings:** Our model analysis revealed that the initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, representing myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories. The motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. Scanning of the model parameter space showed that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that biochemical regulation plays a crucial role in lamellipodial dynamics, but the minimal mechanisms of lamellipodial motility, such as growth and spreading of a flat actin network wrapped in plasma membrane and myosin-powered contraction of this network, are mechanical in nature. The balance of actin protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium, feeding back to the actin-myosin contraction in the bulk of the lamellipodium.

    **Conclusions:** Our systematic exploration of the minimal actin-myosin contractility model demonstrates that the mechanical state of the cell critically depends on just three dimensionless parameters. Our simulations show that the aspect ratio of a steadily moving cell varies between 1 and 3, in agreement with experimental observations. The positive feedback between myosin asymmetry, actin flow, and cell movement is the key to the stable motility. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the lamellipodial motility, shedding light on the complex interplay between actin-myosin contractility and cell movement.

    **Title:** A Novel Geometric Graph Model for Assessing Confidence Levels of Protein-Protein Interactions and Predicting Novel Interactions

    **Research Question:** Can a geometric graph model be used to assess the confidence levels of known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and predict novel interactions in PPI networks?

    **Methods:** We present a novel technique that utilizes a geometric graph model to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks obtained from experimental studies. Our approach is based on the geometric graph model, which is the best fitting network model for PPI networks. We applied our technique to the human PPI network downloaded from BioGRID and predicted 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

    **Main Findings:** Our method achieved a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%, outperforming existing PPI network post-processing techniques. We validated a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and the newer release of BioGRID. Our results demonstrate that the geometric graph model can be used to detect false positives and false negatives in PPI networks.

    **Implications:** The high levels of noise and incompleteness in PPI networks are a major concern, with false positive rates as high as 64% and false negative rates ranging from 43% to 71% for yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screens. Our method addresses this issue by providing a novel approach to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks. By predicting novel interactions, our method can guide future biological experiments and improve our understanding of protein function and regulation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the geometric graph model in assessing the confidence levels of known interactions and predicting novel interactions in PPI networks. Our method has the potential to improve the accuracy of PPI networks and facilitate the discovery of new protein functions and interactions.

    **Title:** Bi-directional Transcription of Trinucleotide Repeat Expansions Enhances Toxicity in Drosophila Model of Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1)

    **Research Question:** Do anti-sense expanded-repeat transcripts contribute to the pathogenesis of trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)?

    **Methods:** We established a Drosophila melanogaster model of DM1 by expressing pure, uninterrupted CTG repeat expansions in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of a control protein, DsRed. We then tested the effect of co-expressing CTG and CAG disease transcripts to investigate the role of bi-directional transcription in disease pathogenesis.

    **Main Findings:** Our studies revealed that co-expression of CTG and CAG expanded repeats resulted in dramatically enhanced toxicity in Drosophila, concomitant with the generation of triplet repeat-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs targeted the expression of CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein (TBP), which bear long CAG repeats in both flies and humans.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may dramatically enhance toxicity in human repeat expansion diseases where anti-sense transcription occurs. This suggests that bi-directional transcription of trinucleotide repeat expansions contributes to the pathogenesis of DM1 and potentially other trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our Drosophila model of DM1 recapitulates key features of the human disease, including RNA accumulations in muscle nuclei and affected alternative splicing. The generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs provides a novel mechanism by which anti-sense expanded-repeat transcripts may contribute to disease pathogenesis. These findings highlight the importance of considering bi-directional transcription in the development of therapeutic strategies for trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases.

    **Title:** Novel Insights into the Phylogeny and Virulence of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, a Soft Rot Model Strain

    **Research Question:** What are the phylogenetic relationships and virulence determinants of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, a soft rot model strain isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the early 1980s?

    **Methods:** We employed genomic approaches, including proteome and genome comparisons of all sequenced soft rot bacteria, to investigate the phylogeny and virulence of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193. We also conducted in planta experiments to identify features that separate SCC3193 and other P. wasabiae strains from other soft rot bacteria.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, previously classified as Pectobacterium carotovorum, can now be accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae. We identified novel virulence determinants, including the putative transcriptional regulator SirB, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters (Vic1 and Vic2), which contain predicted virulence genes. We also found that SCC3193 lacks a type III secretion system, which contributes to the virulence of other soft rot species.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that Pectobacterium wasabiae has been present, though unnoticed, in potato fields worldwide for a long time. The novel virulence determinants identified in this study may play a crucial role in the poorly understood latent stage of infection. Our study provides a solid basis for further investigation of the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria and potentially other bacteria as well.

    **Conclusions:** This study presents a revised phylogeny, an analysis of virulence determinants, and a characterization of genomic islands of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193. Our results suggest that Pectobacterium wasabiae has unique features compared to other Pectobacterium strains, which were likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer. The absence of a type III secretion system is a distinctive feature separating Pectobacterium wasabiae from other soft rot bacteria, plant pathogens, and animal pathogenic enterobacteria.

    **Title:** Systemic Alterations of Mitochondrial Protein Networks in Response to Mitochondrial DNA Depletion

    **Research Question:** How do nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome) change in response to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, a condition associated with various human diseases?

    **Methods:** We employed a data-integrative network analysis of gene expression data to investigate the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) mitochondria. We used isotope-coded affinity tag (cICAT) quantitative analysis to compare protein abundances in mitochondria isolated from normal (ρ+) and mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) osteosarcoma cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed two predominant subnetworks of up-regulated and down-regulated proteins, which exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules were involved in typical mitochondrial functions, such as energy production, metabolism, and protein folding. In contrast, the up-regulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data showed that ρ0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that mt protein composition changes to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. This study provides a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions and highlights the importance of mt protein functional networks in understanding human diseases associated with mtDNA damage.

    **Conclusions:** Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mtDNA damage is a driving force behind various human diseases, including aging and apoptosis. Our findings suggest that mt protein functional networks provide a valuable tool for understanding the biological implications of mt regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional mt states. The data-integrative approach used in this study can be valuable to the computational biology community working on gene expression and proteomics analysis.

    **Title:** Predicting In-Vivo Transition Rates from In-Vitro Kinetics: A Novel Method for Biomolecular Processes

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a general method to deduce in-vivo transition rates from their in-vitro values for complex biomolecular processes, such as protein synthesis by ribosomes?

    **Methods:** We introduce the kinetic distance, a new concept that quantitatively compares the kinetics of a multistep process in different environments. This distance depends logarithmically on the transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of the underlying free energy barriers. We then minimize the kinetic distance between the in-vitro and in-vivo process, imposing the constraint that the deduced rates reproduce a known global property, such as the overall in-vivo speed.

    **Main Findings:** We apply our method to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. We describe the process by a codon-specific Markov model with three reaction pathways, corresponding to the initial binding of cognate, near-cognate, and non-cognate tRNA. We determine all individual transition rates in vitro and predict the in-vivo rates by the constrained minimization procedure. We validate these rates by three independent sets of in-vivo data, obtained for codon-dependent translation speeds, codon-specific translation dynamics, and missense error frequencies. In all cases, we find good agreement between theory and experiment without adjusting any fit parameter.

    **Implications:** The deduced in-vivo rates lead to smaller error frequencies than the known in-vitro rates, primarily by an improved initial selection of tRNA. Our method is relatively simple from a computational point of view and can be applied to any biomolecular process, for which we have detailed information about the in-vitro kinetics.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a novel method to predict in-vivo transition rates from in-vitro kinetics for complex biomolecular processes. Our approach is based on the kinetic distance, a new concept that provides a quantitative measure for the similarity of the in-vitro and in-vivo kinetics. We demonstrate the predictive power of our method by applying it to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. Our results show that the deduced in-vivo rates lead to smaller error frequencies than the known in-vitro rates, highlighting the potential of our method to improve our understanding of biomolecular processes in living cells.

    **Title:** Estimating Short-Term Mutation and Recombination Rates in Helicobacter pylori: Implications for Understanding Bacterial Evolution

    **Research Question:** What are the short-term rates of mutation and recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and how do these rates impact our understanding of bacterial evolution?

    **Methods:** We sequenced an average of 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates of Helicobacter pylori, including 34 pairs of sequential samples and single isolates from 29 individuals from 10 families. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the rates of mutation, recombination, mean length of recombination tracts, and average diversity in those tracts.

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that the short-term mutation rate in Helicobacter pylori is 1.4×10−6 to 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, with three times as many substitutions introduced by recombination as by mutation. We also found that the long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5–17-fold lower, partly due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection.

    **Implications:** Our estimates of short-term mutation rates in Helicobacter pylori are significantly higher than previous estimates, which were based on a universal inter-species molecular clock rate calibrated using outdated geological dates. Our findings suggest that short-term mutation rates can vary dramatically in different bacterial species, spanning several orders of magnitude. This has significant implications for our understanding of bacterial evolution and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a robust estimate of the short-term mutation rate in Helicobacter pylori, which is essential for understanding the evolution of this bacterium and its interactions with its human hosts. Our results also highlight the importance of considering short-term mutation rates in bacterial evolution, rather than relying on long-term estimates based on outdated assumptions. Further research is needed to explore the implications of these findings for our understanding of bacterial evolution and the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.

    **Title:** Melanopsin-based photoreception in the mammalian retina extends to the thalamo-cortical visual pathway

    **Research Question:** Do melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) contribute to conventional visual pathways, beyond their known roles in circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements?

    **Methods:** We used new reporter lines and anatomical/physiological experiments to investigate the projections and activity of mRGCs in mice lacking rods and cones (rd/rd cl) and in mice with intact retinas (Opn1mwR). We recorded light responses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and visual cortex of these mice.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that mRGC projections are more extensive than previously thought, extending across the dLGN, the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. We found that mRGCs support extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex, even in mice lacking rods and cones. Using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses, we revealed strong melanopsin input to approximately 40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. We demonstrated that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons.

    **Implications:** Our data establish melanopsin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones. These findings identify mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicate that they may support vision in people suffering retinal degeneration.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first direct examination of melanopsin contributions to the activity of the thalamo-cortical visual pathway. Our results suggest that melanopsin contributes a quality of visual information to the thalamo-cortical pathway that is unavailable from rods or cones. We propose that mRGCs are responsible for setting the tonic firing rate of 40% of thalamic neurons according to the level of illumination, implicating melanopsin in aspects of spatial brightness perception. These findings have implications for our understanding of visual perception and suggest that good practice in architectural lighting should be revised to take account of the specific requirements of melanopsin photoreception.

    Title: Altered Mucosal Humoral Responses in HIV-1-Infected Individuals: Implications for Immune Dysregulation and Inflammation

    Background: HIV-1 infection is characterized by an early and profound depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies.

    Research Question: Does the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals result in altered humoral responses specific to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces?

    Methods: We conducted a comprehensive protein microarray analysis of systemic and mucosal humoral responses to intestinal microbiota in HIV-1-infected individuals, both treated and untreated with antiretroviral therapy (ART).

    Main Findings: Our study revealed four key findings: (1) elevated levels of total and antigen-specific IgM in intestinal secretions; (2) reduced IgG/IgM and IgA/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens in intestinal secretions; (3) reduced IgG levels to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in plasma; and (4) a negative correlation between CD4+ T cell counts and plasma IgG levels specific to these antigens.

    Implications: These findings indicate that the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals results in reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigenic variety in the gut lumen. This dysregulation of mucosal humoral responses may contribute to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals.

    Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of altered mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1-infected individuals, characterized by elevated IgM levels and reduced IgG/IgM and IgA/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to mucosal microbial antigens. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of immune dysregulation and inflammation in HIV-1 infection and highlight the need for further investigation into the role of CD4+ T cells in regulating mucosal humoral responses.

    **Title:** Emergent Diversity Waves in Saturated Ecosystems: A Model of Collapse-Driven Population Dynamics

    **Research Question:** How do populations of species in saturated ecosystems respond to abrupt and severe reductions in size of a single species, and what are the emergent dynamics that arise from this redistribution of resources?

    **Methods:** We propose and model a novel mechanism of population dynamics driven by episodic catastrophes, where the collapse of a globally dominating population frees up resources for the remaining species. Our model, the "Kill-the-Winner" (KtW) model, incorporates stochastic births and deaths, diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.

    **Main Findings:** Our simulations reveal the emergence of cyclic "diversity waves" triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards, resulting in a bimodal time-aggregated distribution of species abundances. The lower peak is formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced species, while the upper peak consists of species that have not yet collapsed in the current wave. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory transmitted across several waves, giving rise to a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7.

    **Implications:** Our model provides a new framework for understanding population dynamics in saturated ecosystems, where the collapse of a single species can have a cascading effect on the entire community. This mechanism may be relevant for communities of bacteria, where strain-specific collapses can be caused by invading bacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an important role.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the classic definition of fitness in terms of long-term exponential growth rate is inappropriate for our model, as the long-term growth rate of each species is exactly zero. Instead, our model highlights the importance of considering the emergent dynamics of diversity waves, which arise from the redistribution of resources freed up by episodic catastrophes. The robustness of our model to variations in parameters and rules suggests that this mechanism may be a general feature of saturated ecosystems.

    Title: Unveiling an Additional Mechanism of Gradient Navigation in Escherichia coli Chemotaxis

    Background: Chemotactic movement of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a paradigm of simple behavior that has been extensively studied. Given the significant competitive advantage conferred by chemotaxis and the high evolution rates in bacteria, the chemotaxis system is expected to be strongly optimized. E. coli follows gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemoeffector concentrations along their runs, a strategy that is most efficient given their size and swimming speed.

    Research Question: Can an additional mechanism of gradient navigation exist in E. coli chemotaxis, beyond the commonly assumed regulation of tumble probability?

    Methods: We used computer simulations to predict the existence of an additional mechanism of gradient navigation in E. coli. We extended a recently published hybrid model of chemotactic E. coli to investigate the dependence of tumbling angle on the number of switching motors.

    Main Findings: Our simulations demonstrate that not only the tumbling probability but also the degree of reorientation during a tumble depend on the swimming direction along the gradient. Although the difference in mean tumbling angles up and down the gradient is small, it results in a dramatic enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that tuning of tumbling angle depending on swimming direction serves as an additional navigation mechanism for E. coli and other peritrichously flagellated bacteria with similar chemotaxis behavior. This fine-tuning of tumble is mediated by the same adjustment of tumbling frequency that underlies the conventional chemotaxis strategy of E. coli.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals a new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis, which arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and a resulting fine-tuning of tumbling angle. This additional mechanism of gradient navigation is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria, indicating yet another level of evolutionary development of bacterial chemotaxis.

    Title: Stat3-Mediated Signaling Plays a Crucial Role in Medullary Thymic Epithelial Cell (mTEC) Development and Homeostasis

    Research Question: What is the role of Stat3-mediated signaling in the development and homeostasis of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) in the thymus?

    Background: mTECs are essential for establishing central tolerance by expressing self-peptides that delete autoreactive thymocytes and/or divert them into the regulatory T cell lineage. Activation of the NFκB signaling pathway is indispensable for mTEC maturation and proliferation, resulting in proper medullary region formation.

    Methods: We investigated the role of Stat3-mediated signaling in mTEC development and homeostasis using a constitutively active Stat3 transgene targeted to the mTEC compartment and conditional deletion of Stat3 in mTECs.

    Main Findings: Our results show that Stat3-mediated signaling plays a key role in mTEC development and homeostasis. Expression of a constitutively active Stat3 transgene increased mTEC cellularity and bypassed the requirement for signals from positively selected thymocytes to drive medullary region formation. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 disrupted medullary region architecture and reduced the number of mTECs. Stat3 signaling promoted survival of immature MHCIIloCD80lo mTEC precursors, but did not affect mTEC proliferation.

    Implications: Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to the NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signals play an essential role in regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis. The presence of phosphorylated Stat3 in immature MHCIIloCD80lo mTECs of steady-state thymi suggests that Stat3 signaling may be involved in thymus homeostasis.

    Conclusions: Our study reveals that Stat3 activation is indispensable for optimal medullary region formation and mTEC maintenance. The contrasting outcomes imposed by enforcing or preventing Stat3-mediated signaling in mTECs demonstrate that Stat3 activation plays a key role in medullary region formation and mTEC maintenance. These findings highlight the importance of Stat3-mediated signaling in the development and homeostasis of the thymic medullary compartment.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Identification of Small Noncoding RNAs in Clostridium difficile Reveals Novel Regulatory Mechanisms

    **Research Question:** What is the role of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) in Clostridium difficile physiology and pathogenesis?

    **Methods:** We employed an in silico approach to identify 511 sRNA candidates in both intergenic and coding regions of the C. difficile genome. In parallel, RNA-seq and differential 5′-end RNA-seq were used to globally identify C. difficile sRNAs and their transcriptional start sites at three different growth conditions (exponential growth phase, stationary phase, and starvation).

    **Main Findings:** Our global experimental approach identified 251 putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans-riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 sRNAs was confirmed by gene-specific experimental approaches. Some sRNAs, including an antisense RNA involved in control of C. difficile autolytic activity, showed growth phase-dependent expression profiles. We also detected abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci, which may be important for C. difficile survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities.

    **Implications:** The discovery of novel sRNAs by our approaches emphasizes the potential diversity of sRNAs in clostridia and highlights the importance of RNA-based mechanisms controlling key steps during the infection cycle of C. difficile. The presence of a great number of functional riboswitches suggests a wide use of 5′-cis-RNA regulatory elements that ensure rapid and adequate response of C. difficile to environmental changes.

    **Conclusions:** This first experimental genome-wide identification of C. difficile sRNAs provides a firm basis for future RNome characterization and identification of molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in this emergent enteropathogen. Further work is necessary to experimentally detect and catalogue regulatory RNAs in other clostridial species. The regulatory RNAs revealed in this work for the most part are unique to C. difficile and could be associated with specific physiopathology of this bacterium.

    **Title:** Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Downregulates Liver-Specific MicroRNA miR-122 by Inhibiting GLD-2, a Non-Canonical Cytoplasmic Poly(A) Polymerase

    **Research Question:** How does the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein regulate the expression of liver-specific microRNA miR-122, a key proviral factor for HCV?

    **Methods:** We employed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies and in vitro experiments to investigate the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the HCV core protein downregulates miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of its known functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. Furthermore, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3′ end by 3′-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions, and that the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation. The inhibition of GLD-2 by the HCV core protein affects multiple miRNAs in addition to miR-122, suggesting a broader impact on the liver microRNAome.

    **Conclusions:** Collectively, our results demonstrate that the HCV core protein regulates miR-122 expression by inhibiting GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, leading to the destabilization of miR-122 and the dysregulation of its known functions. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV infection and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target the HCV life cycle.

    **Title:** Acquired Immunity to Trypanosomes in Wild African Lions: Implications for Trypanosomiasis Control

    **Research Question:** Do wild African lions exhibit acquired immunity to trypanosome infections, and if so, what are the implications for trypanosomiasis control in humans and livestock?

    **Methods:** We conducted an epidemiological study of trypanosome infections in wild African lions in the Serengeti ecosystem. We analyzed age-prevalence data of Trypanosoma brucei s.l. and other trypanosome species in lions to determine if there was evidence of acquired immunity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show a distinct peak and decrease in age-prevalence of T. brucei s.l. infection in wild African lions, consistent with an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with the more genetically diverse species, T. congolense sensu lato. We also found that the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, T. brucei rhodesiense, disappears by 6 years of age, apparently in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes, including the non-pathogenic subspecies, T. brucei brucei.

    **Implications:** These findings provide the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in any host species. Our results suggest that frequent re-exposure to each trypanosome species through tsetse bites accelerates the onset and extent of immunity, leading to lower prevalence in areas of high-tsetse exposure. This has significant implications for trypanosomiasis control in humans and livestock, particularly in regions where cattle act as a major reservoir of human infection, such as East Uganda.

    **Conclusions:** Our study challenges the long-held assumption that immunity to trypanosomes is impossible and suggests novel pathways for vaccinations against trypanosomiasis. The discovery of acquired immunity in wild African lions generates an entirely new perspective on existing data and future research in this field. These findings have the potential to inform the development of effective vaccines against trypanosomiasis, a disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

    **Title:** Identifying Therapeutic Targets in Human Coagulation Cascades using Mechanistic Mathematical Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis

    **Research Question:** Can mechanistic mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis be used to identify points of fragility in human coagulation cascades, which can serve as therapeutic targets despite model uncertainty?

    **Methods:** We developed and validated a mechanistic model of the coagulation cascade using 21 published datasets from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using a Monte Carlo strategy to calculate overall state sensitivity coefficients (OSSCs), which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. We also found that anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants, with anti-fX/FXa inhibitors having FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

    **Implications:** Our findings support the working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades can be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. The model's ability to capture the bulk of thrombin generation dynamics resulting from TF–FVIIa-initiated coagulation in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants suggests that it can be a useful tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of mechanistic mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis in identifying points of fragility in human coagulation cascades, which can serve as therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the importance of refining pro- and anti-platelet activation mechanisms operating on the endothelium and further exploring the robustness of fIX mechanisms using in vivo animal models or cell-based assays. Overall, this study contributes to the development of a rational basis for target selection in molecular medicine and clinical development.

    **Title:** Non-Linear Kinetics of Phage-Bacteria Interactions in Phage Therapy: An In Vitro Study of Campylobacter jejuni and a Virulent Phage

    **Research Question:** What are the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions in the context of phage therapy, specifically for the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni and a virulent phage?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions in an in vitro system. Phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni were generated, and a PK/PD model of phage-bacteria interactions was tested against in vitro experimental data for a low passage strain of C. jejuni and a virulent phage.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arise readily, and that even a simplistic model fits the data surprisingly well. We confirmed the existence of inundation and proliferation thresholds, which are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy. By fitting the model to time series data, we estimated thresholds and rate constants directly, revealing density-dependent features of phage infectivity worthy of further investigation.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of understanding the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions in the context of phage therapy. The development of a suitable theoretical framework for understanding the kinetic properties of phages as "self-replicating pharmaceuticals" is essential for designing effective phage treatments. Our results demonstrate the value of combining empirical studies with kinetic models to gain a deeper understanding of phage-bacteria interactions.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions in phage therapy, specifically for C. jejuni and a virulent phage. Our findings emphasize the need for a threshold-based understanding of phage-bacteria interactions to predict the effectiveness of phage therapy. By testing models of in vitro phage therapy, we can gain a better understanding of how PK/PD theory can be applied in clinical and other in vivo settings, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective phage therapies.

    **Title:** Identification and Functional Characterization of a Snail Toll-like Receptor Involved in Schistosoma mansoni Infection in Biomphalaria glabrata

    **Background:** Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma flatworms, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata serves as an obligate intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis in Africa and South America. Understanding the snail's immune response to Schistosoma infection is crucial for developing effective disease prevention and control strategies.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the snail's immune response to Schistosoma mansoni infection?

    **Methods:** We employed a peptide screen of snail immune cell surface proteins to identify a TLR-like protein in Biomphalaria glabrata (BgTLR). We compared the expression of BgTLR in resistant (BS-90) and susceptible (M-line) snail strains following Schistosoma mansoni challenge. We also used targeted siRNA oligonucleotides to knockdown BgTLR expression in BS-90 snails and assessed the impact on infection outcome.

    **Main Findings:** We identified BgTLR as a functional snail Toll-like receptor involved in the cellular immune response of Biomphalaria glabrata following Schistosoma mansoni challenge. BgTLR expression was significantly increased in resistant BS-90 snails compared to susceptible M-line snails. Knockdown of BgTLR in BS-90 snails resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, leading to patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and demonstrates the importance of BgTLR in regulating Schistosoma mansoni infection in Biomphalaria glabrata. This finding has significant implications for understanding the molecular basis of snail-schistosome compatibility and identifying potential targets for disease prevention and control efforts.

    **Conclusions:** Our results highlight the importance of TLRs in the snail's immune response to Schistosoma mansoni infection and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying snail-schistosome compatibility. Further studies on BgTLR and other snail immune factors will contribute to the development of effective strategies for controlling schistosomiasis and achieving the World Health Organization's goal of global elimination by 2025.

    **Title:** Development of a Novel Immuno-Epidemiological Tool for Assessing Human Exposure to Aedes Mosquito Bites in French Polynesia

    **Background:** Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, are primary vectors of infectious diseases in French Polynesia, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis. Effective vector control measures are hindered by the scarcity of tools for assessing disease transmission risk and evaluating the efficacy of control programs.

    **Research Question:** Can the presence of antibodies directed against mosquito salivary proteins serve as a biomarker of human exposure to Aedes mosquito bites?

    **Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in Tahiti and Moorea islands, where both Aedes species are present, to detect and quantify immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against proteins from salivary gland extracts (SGE) of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis in human populations. ELISA tests were used to evaluate IgG responses in sera from local residents and a cohort of people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these Aedes mosquitoes.

    **Main Findings:** The study revealed that 98% and 68% of individuals in Tahiti and Moorea, respectively, have developed IgG directed against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE. In contrast, 97% of individuals from metropolitan France had no IgG directed against SGE of either mosquito species. Additional cohorts representing different entomological Aedes contexts showed no ELISA IgG cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE.

    **Implications:** The results suggest that the IgG response to salivary gland extracts is a valid and specific biomarker of human exposure to Aedes mosquito bites. This novel immuno-epidemiological tool will enhance our understanding of people's exposure to mosquito bites, facilitate the identification of areas where disease transmission risk is high, and permit the evaluation of the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of IgG responses against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis saliva as biomarkers of exposure to mosquito bites in French Polynesia. The development of this tool will contribute to the improvement of vector control measures and the prevention of infectious diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.

    **Title:** Metabolic Manipulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Unveiling the Host-Pathogen Interface in Macrophage Infection

    **Research Question:** How does Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) manipulate the metabolic machinery of host macrophages to facilitate its intracellular survival and pathogenicity?

    **Methods:** Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in macrophages infected with Mtb strains of varying virulence was conducted to elucidate the host-pathogen interface. A panel of mycobacterial strains with distinct genotypes and phenotypes was used to examine the effects of Mtb infection on host cell metabolism.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed that Mtb infection modulates host cell metabolism to integrate pathways promoting macrophage survival and mycobacterial sustenance. Temporal analysis of metabolic flux identified a core subset of host reactions targeted by Mtb, which converged with pathogen-derived factors to define determinants of pathogenicity. Notably, the glycemic status of the individual was found to influence macrophage apoptosis and TB susceptibility.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Mtb pathogenicity is not solely dependent on the virulence properties of the infecting strain, but also on the metabolic status of the host. The integration of host and pathogen-derived factors highlights the complexity of the host-pathogen interface in Mtb infection. Furthermore, our study reveals that metabolic intervention may be a critical determinant of TB pathology, underscoring the need for a reevaluation of existing paradigms for understanding Mtb pathogenicity.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the metabolic manipulation of host macrophages by Mtb, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms underlying TB pathogenesis. Our findings have significant implications for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines against TB, and highlight the importance of considering the metabolic status of the host in the context of Mtb infection. By elucidating the host-pathogen interface, our study paves the way for a more nuanced understanding of TB pathogenicity and the identification of new targets for intervention.
Title: Coordination of Crossover Recombination with Synaptonemal Complex Disassembly and Bivalent Formation by ZHP-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans

    Abstract:
    During the first meiotic division, the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes relies on crossover recombination and the formation of chiasmata. ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, is essential for crossover recombination. We investigated the role of ZHP-3 in coordinating crossover recombination with synaptonemal complex (SC) disassembly and bivalent formation. Our results show that ZHP-3 protein localization is highly dynamic, shifting from along the length of the SC to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becoming restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events. A zhp-3::gfp transgene partially complements a null mutation, revealing a separation of function; while the fusion protein promotes nearly wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. Furthermore, smo-1 mutants exhibit phenotypes similar to zhp-3::gfp mutants at higher temperatures, and smo-1; zhp-3::gfp double mutants exhibit more severe meiotic defects than either single mutant, consistent with a role for SUMO in SC disassembly and bivalent differentiation. We propose that coordination of crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome segregation and highlight the importance of ZHP-3 in coordinating crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation in C. elegans.

Title: Eco-climatic factors shaping the micro-geographic abundance and dynamics of Aedes albopictus in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas of Rome, Italy

Background: Aedes albopictus, a tropical invasive species, has colonized temperate regions of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and its aggressive daytime outdoor biting behavior.

Research Question: What are the eco-climatic factors affecting the abundance and dynamics of Aedes albopictus in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas of Rome, Italy?

Methods: Longitudinal adult monitoring was conducted along a 70 km transect across and beyond the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area of Rome. Two fine-scale spatiotemporal datasets were exploited to analyze the effect of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Aedes albopictus abundance and dynamics.

Main Findings: The results showed a strong association between highly anthropized habitats and high adult abundance in both metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas. "Small green islands" corresponding to hotspots of abundance were found in metropolitan areas only. A bimodal seasonal dynamics was observed, with a second peak of abundance in autumn due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures.

Implications: The findings provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher. The results also highlight potential public health risks after the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.

Conclusions: This study highlights the complex relationship between landscape composition and Aedes albopictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas of Rome, Italy. The results emphasize the importance of considering eco-climatic factors in shaping the micro-geographic abundance and dynamics of Aedes albopictus in temperate regions of Southern Europe. The findings have significant implications for public health policy and mosquito control strategies in urban areas.

    **Title:** Phthiocerol Dimycocerosates (DIM) Mediate Mycobacterium tuberculosis Invasion of Macrophages by Modulating Host Cell Membrane Lipid Organization

    **Research Question:** How do phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), contribute to the bacterium's ability to invade and survive within host macrophages?

    **Methods:** We generated Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis and used these mutants to investigate the role of DIM in receptor-dependent phagocytosis and phagosomal acidification. We also employed cholesterol-depleting drugs and a new cholesterol-pyrene probe to examine the effects of DIM on host cell membrane fluidity and lipid organization.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that DIM are essential for the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb by macrophages and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. We show that the effects of DIM require a state of membrane fluidity, as demonstrated by experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs that abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. Furthermore, we found that the insertion of a new cholesterol-pyrene probe in living cells revealed changes in the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core upon contact with Mtb, which was dependent on DIM.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organization in the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favor the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH, driving bacilli into a protective niche.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Mtb virulence and highlights the importance of lipid organization in the host cell membrane for the bacterium's ability to invade and survive within macrophages. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the host-pathogen interaction and may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

    **Title:** Systematic Analysis of Mesoscopic Neural Networks: Unveiling Complex Dynamics through Spontaneous Symmetry-Breaking

    **Research Question:** How do small neural networks composed of a few tens of neurons exhibit complex dynamics, and what are the implications of these dynamics for our understanding of neural information processing?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel systematic analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily small networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. We employed an analytically tractable approach to study the local bifurcations of neural activity and numerically determined the global bifurcations.

    **Main Findings:** We found that for strong inhibition, these networks give rise to very complex dynamics, characterized by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This qualitative change in neural dynamics is a finite-size effect of the network, revealing qualitative and previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation.

    **Implications:** The most significant consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reduce the detrimental effects of noise correlations on cortical information processing.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that small neural networks exhibit complex dynamics that cannot be captured by mean-field approximations. The emergence of multiple branching solutions through spontaneous symmetry-breaking highlights the importance of considering finite-size effects in the study of mesoscopic neural networks. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of neural information processing and suggest that mesoscopic networks may play a crucial role in regulating functional heterogeneity and mitigating the effects of noise correlations. Our work provides a novel mathematical framework for studying the dynamics of small neural networks, paving the way for further research into the complex behavior of mesoscopic neural circuits.
Title: Detection of Viable Leishmania Parasites in Extralesional Sites of Dermal Leishmaniasis Patients Using Leishmania 7SLRNA as a Viability Marker

    Abstract:

    Background: The clinical and epidemiological significance of Leishmania DNA in extralesional sites is often obscured by uncertainty regarding the viability of the parasites. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the dissemination of Leishmania during active disease and the potential role of human infection in transmission using Leishmania 7SLRNA as a viability marker.

    Research Question: Can Leishmania 7SLRNA be used to establish viability and estimate parasite burden in extralesional sites of dermal leishmaniasis patients?

    Methods: We analyzed monocytes, tonsil swabs, aspirates of normal skin, and lesions from 28 cutaneous and 2 mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients using kDNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were further analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leishmania 7SLRNA genes and transcripts.

    Main Findings: Leishmania 7SLRNA amplification coincided with luciferase activity, confirming the discrimination of parasite viability. Of 22 patients presenting kDNA in extralesional samples, Leishmania 7SLRNA genes or transcripts were detected in one or more kDNA-positive samples in 100% and 73% of patients, respectively. Gene and transcript copy number amplified from extralesional tissues were comparable to lesions. 7SLRNA transcripts were detected in 13/19 (68%) monocyte samples, 5/12 (42%) tonsil swabs, 4/11 (36%) normal skin aspirates, and 22/25 (88%) lesions; genes were quantifiable in 15/19 (79%) monocyte samples, 12/13 (92%) tonsil swabs, and 8/11 (73%) normal skin aspirates.

    Implications: Our findings demonstrate that viable parasites are present in extralesional sites, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin of dermal leishmaniasis patients. Leishmania 7SLRNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis.

    Conclusions: Leishmania viability, parasite burden, and infection of extralesional tissues can be parasitologically established by amplification of 7SLRNA genes and transcripts. During active dermal leishmaniasis, viable Leishmania are present in blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, demonstrating dissemination of infection without triggering pathogenesis. The detection and quantification of parasites are essential for determining the status of infection, monitoring treatment, and resolving gaps in the understanding of the natural history of human infection.

    **Title:** Combinatorial Histone Modifications Predict DNA Replication Timing in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** Do histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) act combinatorially to regulate DNA replication timing in Drosophila?

    **Methods:** We analyzed a comprehensive dataset of 95 chromatin features, including 30 HMs and 65 CBPs, profiled in Drosophila S2 cells using ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq. We used quantitative statistical models to investigate the combinatorial potential of these features for predicting DNA replication timing.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that combinations of CBPs exhibit moderate predictive power for replication timing, while pairwise interactions between HMs lead to accurate predictions genome-wide. Independent feature importance and model analyses revealed a simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication timing, which reaches 80% of the full model accuracy using six model terms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pairwise combinations of HMs can predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types.

    **Implications:** Our study provides support for the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and reveals cell-type independent key elements thereof. These findings suggest that combinatorial HM patterns might contribute to the regulation of DNA replication timing, a fundamental cellular process.

    **Conclusions:** Our work sheds light on the complex relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosophila. The identification of combinatorial HM patterns and their predictive power for replication timing has important implications for our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process. Further experimental investigation of these key elements may contribute to elucidate the mode of regulation of DNA replication timing in metazoans.

    **Title:** Investigating the Spatial Dynamics of Dengue Virus Serotypes in Brazil: A Phylogeographic Approach

    **Research Question:** What are the spatial dynamics of dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3) in Brazil, and what factors contribute to their spread?

    **Methods:** We employed a statistical framework to analyze complete genome sequences of 178 Brazilian dengue virus isolates. We used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) spatial diffusion model to identify predictors of viral spread, including geographic distances, national air traffic data, Aedes aegypti infestation densities, human population densities, and spatial area of each location.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that new lineages of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were introduced to Brazil at intervals of 7-10 years. We found that the introduction of new lineages was most likely to occur from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, followed by dispersal at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. Joint analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data indicated that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, was the primary driver of dengue virus spread in Brazil.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of air traffic fluxes in the spatial spread of DENV within Brazil. The introduction of new lineages is followed by epizootic amplifications in 7-10 year cycles, resulting in periodic dengue serotype-specific peaks in incidence. These findings have significant implications for public health policy and disease surveillance in Brazil and other tropical and subtropical regions.

    **Conclusions:** Our investigation of DENV serotypes 1-3 spatiotemporal dispersal indicates distinct introductions and co-circulation of distinct serotypes and genotypes. The results obtained from genetic data and inferred demographic patterns concur with epidemiological data, emphasizing the importance of aerial transportation in the spread of DENV. However, caution is needed when making predictions about viral emergence, as new lineages can be introduced from outside the Americas due to chance importation events.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Role of Receptive Field Structure in Correlated Neural Activity Across Parallel Sensory Maps

    **Research Question:** How do differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo electrophysiology to investigate the effects of RF structure on correlations between pyramidal neuron activities across the three parallel electrosensory lateral line (ELL) maps. We used a model based on known anatomical differences in receptive field center size and overlap to predict large differences in correlated activity across the maps.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to our initial predictions, in vivo electrophysiological recordings revealed that electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this surprising result, we incorporated the effects of RF surround in our model and found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. Specifically, incorporating known physiological differences in RF structure between the three maps in our model resulted in similar levels of correlation.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations, which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity. This challenges previous studies that have focused on the role of spiking nonlinearity in correlation transfer.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that the antagonistic center-surround organization of RFs plays a crucial role in shaping correlations between pyramidal neuron activities across parallel sensory maps. By systematically varying the size and gain of the RF surround, we found that very different combinations of RF center-surround balance gave rise to nearly identical correlations between pyramidal neuron activities in our model. These findings highlight the importance of considering the complex interplay between RF structure and correlated neural activity in understanding the neural code.
Title: Unveiling the Role of Noise Correlations in Population Coding: A Theoretical Framework

    Abstract:
    In the realm of neuroscience, understanding how sensory neurons encode stimuli in the presence of noise has been a long-standing question. Specifically, how do noise correlations between pairs of neurons impact the population's ability to encode the stimulus? To address this, we investigated a general setting for population coding, focusing on how information varies as a function of noise correlations while holding other aspects of the problem constant. Our results provide unifying insights into the role of noise correlations, summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples.

    Research Question:
    How do noise correlations between pairs of neurons affect the population's ability to encode the stimulus, and what are the conditions under which noise correlations can improve or impair coding performance?

    Methods:
    We employed a general mathematical setup to investigate how coding performance changes as noise correlations are varied. Our setup made no assumptions about the shapes or heterogeneity of neural tuning curves or receptive fields, or the variances in neural responses.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that:

    1. The "sign rule" (SR) holds: if noise correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs compared to their signal correlations, coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity.
    2. The SR does not provide a necessary condition for good coding. We show that a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding, many of which violate the SR and are consistent with experimentally observed correlations.
    3. We provide a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the coding performance (in the presence of noise) will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for understanding the role of noise correlations in population coding. The SR provides a general framework for understanding how noise correlations can improve coding performance, but it is not a necessary condition for good coding. Our results also suggest that a diverse set of correlation structures can lead to optimal coding, which is consistent with experimentally observed correlations.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of noise correlations in population coding. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interplay between signal and noise correlations in understanding how sensory neurons encode stimuli. The SR provides a useful framework for understanding how noise correlations can improve coding performance, but it is not a necessary condition for good coding. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the neural basis of perception and cognition.

    **Title:** Interspecies Interactions between Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Modulate Antibiotic Susceptibility in Polymicrobial Infections

    **Background:** Chronic coinfections of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) frequently fail to respond to antibiotic treatment, leading to significant patient morbidity and mortality. The impact of interspecies interactions on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility remains poorly understood.

    **Research Question:** Do P. aeruginosa clinical isolates alter S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner?

    **Methods:** We utilized a panel of P. aeruginosa burn wound and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung isolates to investigate the impact of P. aeruginosa on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. We measured the bactericidal activity of three antibiotics against S. aureus in the presence of supernatants from 12 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and two laboratory strains.

    **Main Findings:** We found that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner. Specifically, we identified three independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus: (1) P. aeruginosa LasA endopeptidase potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin, (2) rhamnolipids facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake, and (3) 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) induces multidrug tolerance in S. aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that antibiotic susceptibility is complex and dependent not only on the genotype of the pathogen being targeted but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection environment. The production of each of these factors varies between clinical isolates and corresponds to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering interspecies interactions in the treatment of polymicrobial infections. The presence of P. aeruginosa can potentiate vancomycin killing of S. aureus during infection through the production of LasA. These findings underscore the need to decipher interspecies interactions to improve the antibiotic treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Title: Excessive von Willebrand Factor Binding and Neuraminidase-Mediated Platelet Desialylation Contribute to Thrombocytopenia in Dengue Virus Infection

    Abstract:
    Dengue virus (DENV) infection is characterized by thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which may lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. The etiology of DENV-associated thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and involves increased platelet clearance. We investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in DENV infection and their relationship with thrombocytopenia and platelet reactivity. In two observational cohort studies in Indonesia, we found that adult patients with DENV had higher plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and active VWF, and circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in DENV patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. Our data demonstrate that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in DENV results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. Notably, the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. These findings suggest that excessive VWF binding to platelets and neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation contribute to thrombocytopenia in DENV infection, and that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection.

    Research Question:
    What are the mechanisms of platelet clearance in DENV infection and their relationship with thrombocytopenia and platelet reactivity?

    Methods:
    Two observational cohort studies were conducted in Indonesian patients with acute DENV infection. Study 1 investigated the binding of VWF to circulating platelets and its relationship with thrombocytopenia and platelet reactivity. Study 2 determined sialic acid on the platelet surface.

    Main Findings:
    We found that DENV patients had higher plasma concentrations of VWF antigen and active VWF, and circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in DENV patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of SNA and MAL-II to platelets.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that excessive VWF binding to platelets and neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation contribute to thrombocytopenia in DENV infection. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation, suggesting that it might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of platelet clearance in DENV infection and their relationship with thrombocytopenia and platelet reactivity. The findings suggest that excessive VWF binding to platelets and neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation contribute to thrombocytopenia in DENV infection, and that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection.

    Title: Bidirectional Promoters and Their Association with Somatic Cancer Genes

    Research Question: What is the relationship between bidirectional promoters and somatic cancer genes in the human genome?

    Methods: We employed a comprehensive bioinformatics approach using spliced-expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to identify the most complete collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters. We developed a new algorithm to map bidirectional promoters in the human genome and analyzed microarray expression data from 79 human tissues to verify regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters.

    Main Findings: Our results show a highly significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including a substantial number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. We identified new bidirectional promoters, many of which functioned as alternative promoters or regulated novel transcripts. Furthermore, we found that subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that bidirectional promoters may play a pivotal role in regulating co-expression patterns among groups of genes, including those involved in cancer. The repeated use of this promoter structure in the human genome implies that it could be a general mechanism for regulating gene expression. Moreover, the presence of common transcription factor binding sites in a subset of bidirectional promoters associated with cancer genes suggests that misregulation of these promoters could contribute to cancer development.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence of a connection between bidirectional promoters and somatic cancer genes. Our results highlight the importance of bidirectional promoters in regulating gene expression and suggest that they may be a key factor in the development of cancer. Further investigation into the regulation of genes involved in co-expression networks, especially those involved in cancer, will be crucial for understanding the molecular events that contribute to disease. The identification of common transcription factor binding sites in bidirectional promoters associated with cancer genes provides a promising avenue for exploring the mechanisms underlying cancer development and identifying potential therapeutic targets.
Title: Unveiling the Hidden Diversity of Sex Chromosomes in Diptera: A Whole-Genome Analysis of 37 Fly Species

    Abstract:
    The evolution of sex chromosomes is a fundamental aspect of reproductive biology, with many species relying on heteromorphic sex chromosomes to determine sex. Diptera flies, including the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, typically exhibit XY sex chromosomes and a conserved karyotype. However, this study reveals a striking diversity of sex chromosome configurations among 37 fly species belonging to 22 different families of Diptera. Using whole-genome analysis, we identify over a dozen distinct sex chromosome configurations, including species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, replacement of the small dot chromosome as a sex chromosome, and incorporation of up to three chromosomal elements into the sex chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis shows that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently through up-regulation of the single X chromosome in males. Our findings suggest that sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times over the course of Diptera evolution. We propose that the small dot chromosome was either the ancestral sex chromosome or became a sex chromosome in crane flies and the ancestor of midges and higher Diptera. Our study highlights the complex and dynamic nature of sex chromosome evolution in Diptera, providing a rich resource for comparative studies of sex chromosome biology.

    Research Question:
    What is the extent of sex chromosome diversity among Diptera flies, and how have sex chromosomes evolved in these species?

    Methods:
    We conducted a whole-genome analysis of 37 fly species belonging to 22 different families of Diptera, using high-quality genomes and transcriptomes to identify sex chromosome configurations and dosage compensation mechanisms.

    Main Findings:
    We identified over a dozen distinct sex chromosome configurations, including species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, replacement of the small dot chromosome as a sex chromosome, and incorporation of up to three chromosomal elements into the sex chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently through up-regulation of the single X chromosome in males.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times over the course of Diptera evolution, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of sex chromosome evolution. This diversity of sex chromosome configurations provides a rich resource for comparative studies of sex chromosome biology.

    Conclusions:
    Our study reveals a striking diversity of sex chromosome configurations in Diptera, concealed underneath superficially similar karyotypes displaying male heterogamety. We propose that the small dot chromosome was either the ancestral sex chromosome or became a sex chromosome in crane flies and the ancestor of midges and higher Diptera. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of sex chromosomes in Diptera and highlight the need for further comparative studies to understand the underlying mutational routes by which X chromosomes have become demasculinized repeatedly across flies.
Title: Investigating the Association between Zika Virus Infection and Microcephaly in Hawaii: A Retrospective Analysis of Archived Blood Samples

Abstract:

Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen linked to severe fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. Recent outbreaks in the United States have raised concerns about the potential for ZIKV to cause microcephaly in newborns. We aimed to investigate the association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed archived blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012. We tested maternal blood for the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available human ZIKV IgM and IgG ELISA kits.

Results: Blood from one mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody (16.6%), and blood from three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody (50%). We observed a trend toward significance between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, with ZIKV IgG antibody-positive mothers being more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies (Odds ratio [OR] = 11.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8-147.9, p = 0.083). Similarly, ZIKV IgM antibody-positive mothers were also more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgM antibody (OR = 6.8, 95% CI = 0.2-195.1, p = 0.333).

Implications: These findings provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and suggest that ZIKV-positive cases and associated microcephaly may have occurred in the United States as early as 2009. Our results highlight the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring for ZIKV infection in pregnant women, particularly in regions where the virus is endemic.

Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of evidence that ZIKV infection is associated with an increased risk of microcephaly in newborns. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this association and to inform public health strategies for preventing ZIKV transmission and mitigating its effects on fetal development.

    **Title:** Source-Tracking Mycobacterium ulcerans Infections to Water Bodies in Endemic Communities of Ghana

    **Research Question:** Can Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing be used to source-track Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections to specific water bodies in Buruli ulcer (BU) endemic communities in Ghana?

    **Methods:** Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four VNTR loci in the MU Agy99 genome were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars and those from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing.

    **Main Findings:** MU was present in three different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, designated W, X, Y, and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified one mouse with lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as MU infection.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies. Furthermore, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. This study highlights the potential role of water bodies as vehicles for disseminating MU strains and other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM) in endemic communities.

    **Conclusions:** VNTR typing is a useful tool for differentiating MU strains from other MPM and source-tracking MU infections to specific water bodies. Our study provides evidence that patients are likely infected from the water bodies they are frequently exposed to, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains. These findings have significant implications for understanding the transmission dynamics of MU and informing control measures to prevent BU in endemic communities.

    **Title:** Global Patterns of Alien Bird Species Richness: Unveiling the Drivers of Human-Induced Environmental Change

    **Research Question:** What determines the global distribution of alien bird species richness, and how do anthropogenic and environmental factors interact to shape this phenomenon?

    **Methods:** We analyzed an extensive database of 27,723 distribution records for 971 alien bird species worldwide, combining information on colonisation pressure, abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify the determinants of global variation in alien species richness.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven by European (mainly British) colonialism. However, recent introductions are a more widespread phenomenon, involving more species and countries, and driven in part by increasing economic activity. We find that alien bird species richness is currently highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, most notably the number of species introduced (i.e., "colonisation pressure"). Environmental drivers also play a crucial role, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that colonisation pressure is key to understanding alien species richness, show that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, and emphasize the likely ongoing threats to global environments from introductions of species.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first global analysis of the determinants of alien species richness that takes into account colonisation pressure. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between human and biotic factors in shaping the global distribution of alien bird species richness. The results have important implications for understanding and mitigating the impacts of human-induced environmental change, and underscore the need for continued research into the drivers and consequences of alien species introductions.

    **Title:** Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is Essential for Embryo Development, rRNA Gene Transcription, and Chromatin Structure

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) in rRNA gene transcription, chromatin structure, and embryo development?

    **Methods:** We used gene deletion in mouse embryos and conditional deletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to investigate the role of UBF in rRNA gene transcription, chromatin structure, and embryo development.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that UBF is essential for embryo development beyond the morula stage. Conditional deletion of UBF in MEFs reveals that it is also essential for transcription of the rRNA genes and defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. Loss of UBF prevents the formation of the SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and recruitment of the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex, and is accompanied by the recruitment of H3K9me3, canonical histone H1, and HP1α, but not by de novo DNA methylation. Notably, genes retain penta-acetyl H4 and H2A.Z, suggesting that even in the absence of UBF, the rRNA genes can maintain a potentially active state.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that UBF plays a crucial role in determining rRNA gene activity and chromatin structure, and is essential for embryo development. The loss of UBF leads to the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and early embryos, which contains rRNA synthesis and processing factors but does not associate with the rRNA gene loci (NORs).

    **Conclusions:** Our data support the notion that UBF is required for the recruitment of SL1 to the 47S promoter in vivo, and underline UBF's fundamental importance in determining rRNA gene activity. In contrast to other RPI transcription factors, association of the Transcription Termination Factor (TTF1) with the rDNA was clearly not dependent on UBF. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the role of UBF in chromatin structure, rRNA gene transcription, and embryo development.

    **Title:** Direct Long-Range Action of Wingless/Wnt Ligands is Essential for Tissue Patterning in the Adult Drosophila Intestine

    **Research Question:** Does the direct, long-range action of Wingless/Wnt ligands play a critical role in tissue patterning in the adult Drosophila intestine?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of Wingless/Wnt signaling in the adult Drosophila intestine using a membrane-tethered form of Wingless, which prevents its secretion and movement. We analyzed the effects of Wingless tethering on various aspects of intestinal development, including target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Wingless tethering disrupts the critical roles of Wingless during adult intestinal development, including regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway. These defects are phenocopied by Wg pathway inhibition in the intestinal epithelium, indicating that Wg secretion and movement are critical for proper Wg pathway activation during adult gut development.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new evidence that supports the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wingless in tissue patterning, with relevance for animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The identification of additional tissues in which the inhibition of Wg movement disrupts signaling may uncover the general principles that determine the contexts in which the long-range action of Wnt is essential.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the direct, long-range action of Wingless/Wnt ligands is essential for tissue patterning in the adult Drosophila intestine, supporting conclusions from previous studies in the larval wing disc. These findings have implications for our understanding of Wnt signaling in animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease, and may be relevant for the mammalian intestine, which is similarly divided into distinct compartments and dependent on Wnt expression for regionalization.

    **Title:** Host Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator (uPA) Contributes to Group A Streptococcus (GAS) Pathogenesis and Invasive Disease Initiation

    **Research Question:** What is the role of host urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in the recruitment of plasmin by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and the initiation of invasive disease?

    **Methods:** We employed a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection to investigate the contribution of uPA to GAS pathogenesis. C57/black 6J, AlbPLG1, and AlbPLG1/uPA−/− mice were infected with GAS strain 5448, and bacterial dissemination and cell surface plasmin accumulation were assessed.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase (Ska) was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. Furthermore, GAS were able to mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that host uPA plays a critical role in the recruitment of plasmin by GAS and the initiation of invasive disease. The ability of GAS to access a source of plasmin in the absence of streptokinase may have relevance at stages of infection where streptokinase expression is downregulated or when streptokinase is degraded by other GAS virulence factors. These findings highlight the importance of targeting plasminogen activation in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against GAS infections.

    **Title:** Unveiling the CagH-CagI-CagL Subassembly: A Novel Component of the Helicobacter pylori Type IV Secretion System

    **Research Question:** What are the roles of CagH, CagI, and CagL in the type IV secretion system (T4SS) of Helicobacter pylori, and how do they contribute to the translocation of the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells?

    **Methods:** We employed a mass spectrometry-based approach to co-purify CagL, CagI, and CagH, which are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) of H. pylori. We also used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunogold labeling studies to analyze the localization of these proteins in H. pylori co-cultured with gastric epithelial cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis. We show that these proteins are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells. Notably, deletion of the conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif in CagH, CagI, and CagL abrogates CagA translocation and IL-8 induction, and the C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are necessary for pilus formation.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of the CagH-CagI-CagL subassembly in the H. pylori cag T4SS, which is a key virulence factor in the development of gastric cancer. The identification of this subassembly provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori pathogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that CagH, CagI, and CagL are essential components of the H. pylori cag T4SS, involved in pilus biogenesis and the translocation of CagA into gastric epithelial cells. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the H. pylori cag T4SS.

    Title: Identification of Biomarkers of Protection against Bovine Tuberculosis through Global Gene Expression Analysis

    Background: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group of bacteria. Vaccination of cattle offers a long-term solution for controlling the disease, and the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB is a priority.

    Research Question: Can global gene expression analysis identify in vitro predictors of protection against bTB that can facilitate vaccine development?

    Methods: Calves were vaccinated with BCG or a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol. Protective efficacy was determined after M. bovis challenge. RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated PBMCs from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control cattle prior to M. bovis challenge and global gene expression was determined by RNA-seq.

    Main Findings: 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared with vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant pathway related to this dataset, with IL-22 expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection besides INF-γ. The expression of these candidate genes was evaluated by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG-vaccinated and unvaccinated calves, confirming the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy.

    Implications: The identification of IL-22 as a biomarker of protection against bTB has significant implications for the development of a cattle vaccine against the disease. IL-22 has been shown to play a crucial role in the resolution of M. bovis infection, and its expression can be used to predict the success of vaccination after completion of the vaccination protocol.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of global gene expression analysis to identify in vitro predictors of protection against bTB. The identification of IL-22 as a biomarker of protection provides a valuable tool for the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB, and highlights the importance of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in the immune response to M. bovis infection.

    **Title:** Dissecting the Role of γ-TuRC and AIR-1 in Microtubule Organization at Non-Centrosomal Microtubule Organizing Centers (ncMTOCs) in Caenorhabditis elegans Embryonic Intestinal Epithelial Cells

    **Research Question:** How do non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) regulate microtubule organization and dynamics in differentiated cells, and what are the specific roles of γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and AIR-1/Aurora A in this process?

    **Methods:** We optimized a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of γ-TuRC and AIR-1 at the apical ncMTOC in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete GIP-1, MZT-1, AIR-1, and other microtubule regulators, and observed the effects on microtubule organization and dynamics.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that GIP-1, a core component of γ-TuRC, is required to recruit other γ-TuRC components to the apical ncMTOC, including MZT-1, which is characterized here for the first time in animal development. In contrast, AIR-1 and MZT-1 are specifically required to recruit γ-TuRC to the centrosome, but not to centrioles or the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remain robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC upon γ-TuRC and AIR-1 co-depletion, and upon depletion of other known microtubule regulators.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that different microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) use discrete proteins for their function, and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the regulation of microtubule organization and dynamics at ncMTOCs, and highlights the importance of γ-TuRC and AIR-1 in this process. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of microtubule organization in differentiated cells and the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to microtubule dysfunction.

**Title:** Accurate and Efficient Phasing of Human Genomes: A Comparative Study of 11 Approaches

**Research Question:** Can we develop a cost-effective and accurate method for phasing human genomes, taking into account the diploid nature of the human species, where individuals inherit one set of chromosomes paternally and one homologous set of chromosomes maternally?

**Methods:** We compared 11 different approaches to phasing human genomes, including laboratory-based assays and computational methods, using the publicly available "Genome-In-A-Bottle" (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard. We assessed the performance of each approach using metrics such as switch error rates, haplotype block lengths, and the proportion of fully phase-resolved genes.

**Main Findings:** Our results suggest that a hybrid or combined approach, leveraging population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies, provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. We found that the inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. Additionally, we identified DNA sequence signatures associated with genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or SNV density.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering the diploid nature of the human species when phasing genomes. The hybrid approach we developed provides a cost-effective and accurate method for phasing human genomes, which can be applied to a wide range of applications, including genome-wide association studies and personalized medicine. Our findings also suggest that the inclusion of parental genotype data can significantly improve phasing accuracy.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a hybrid computational approach to phasing a single genome is accurate and cost-effective, and exhibits a performance that nearly matches or surpasses laboratory-based approaches. Our results have significant implications for the field of genomics and highlight the importance of considering the diploid nature of the human species when phasing genomes.

    **Title:** ATPase Activity is Dispensable for Type-III Protein Secretion in Gram-Negative Pathogens

    **Research Question:** What is the role of ATPase activity in the type-III protein secretion system (T3SS) of Gram-negative pathogens?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of ATPase activity in the T3SS of Salmonella enterica. Mutations were introduced to increase the proton motive force (PMF) and flagellar substrate levels, and the effects on flagellar biogenesis and virulence effector secretion were analyzed.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that functional flagella can be formed in the absence of type-III ATPase activity by increasing the PMF and flagellar substrate levels. Furthermore, we show that increased PMF bypasses the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) virulence-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. These findings suggest that ATPase activity is dispensable for protein export via T3SS.

    **Implications:** Our data support a role for type-III ATPases in enhancing secretion efficiency under limited secretion substrate concentrations. However, our results also reveal that ATPase activity is not essential for the type-III protein export process. This has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of the bacterial flagellum and T3SS.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that the function of the T3SS-associated ATPase complex is to deliver secretion substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient substrate unfolding. Our findings suggest that either increased substrate production or increased PMF can overcome the requirement for the ATPase complex, allowing for efficient export of late secretion substrates. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying T3SS and flagellar biogenesis in Gram-negative pathogens.

    **Title:** Systematic Identification of Bistable Gene Regulatory Networks using Chemical Reaction Network Theory

    **Research Question:** What is the capacity for bistability in simple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consisting of two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins?

    **Methods:** We employed chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) to conduct a comprehensive in silico survey of 40,680 possible two-gene GRN models, assuming only the most elementary biochemical processes. We used the Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox and the advanced deficiency theory (ADT) algorithm to identify bistable networks.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that ∼90% of the GRN models exhibit bistability for at least some sets of network parameters. We identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures, including 11 minimal bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. Furthermore, we found that 9% of the networks have the capacity for multiple steady states, and only 6.5% are monostable regardless of the network parameters.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies highlights the importance of systematic approaches to identify bistable networks in real biological systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of CRNT in identifying bistable GRNs and provides a comprehensive understanding of the two-gene bistable network family. The 11 minimal bistable networks identified can serve as a starting point for further experimentation to validate their bistable behavior. The approach used in this study can be applied to other systems for which interaction data is available, providing guidance or functional context to identify bistable networks in real biological systems. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of gene regulatory networks and their role in controlling essential biological functions, such as cellular differentiation and cell cycle control.
Title: Identification of HYAL2 Mutations as a Novel Cause of Syndromic Orofacial Clefting and Cor Triatriatum Sinister in Humans and Mice

    Abstract:

    Background: Orofacial clefting is a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental components. Despite numerous studies, the genetic etiology of this heterogeneous condition remains incompletely understood.

    Research Question: What is the role of the HYAL2 gene in the development of orofacial clefting and cor triatriatum sinister in humans and mice?

    Methods: We conducted a genetic analysis of individuals with orofacial clefting and identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene. We also generated Hyal2-/- mice to investigate the effects of HYAL2 deficiency on development.

    Main Findings: We found that mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 2, are associated with orofacial clefting and cor triatriatum sinister in humans and mice. Transfection assays demonstrated that the gene mutations destabilize the HYAL2 protein, leading to reduced protein levels. Hyal2-/- mice exhibited craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, cor triatriatum sinister, and hearing loss.

    Implications: Our findings identify a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice and define the first molecular basis for cor triatriatum sinister in humans. This study highlights the importance of hyaluronidase enzymes in human and mouse development and reveals a previously unrecognized pathway involved in the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting, myopia, and cor triatriatum sinister.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that a deficiency of the HA-degrading enzyme HYAL2 is a novel cause of syndromic orofacial clefting in humans and submucosal cleft palate in mice, and define the first molecular explanation for cor triatriatum sinister in humans. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying orofacial clefting and cor triatriatum sinister, and may ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

    **Title:** Molecular Remodeling of Tip Links in Auditory Hair Cells: A Novel Mechanism for Regeneration and Maintenance of Mechanosensory Function

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize simultaneously immuno-gold particles and stereocilia links in terminally differentiated mammalian auditory hair cells. We also used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to assess mechanotransduction currents.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that functional, mechanotransduction-mediating tip links have at least two molecular compositions: PCDH15/CDH23 and PCDH15/PCDH15. During regeneration, shorter tip links containing nearly equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first, mediating mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca2+-dependent decay (adaptation). The mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells. The two-step molecular remodeling process we discovered may underlie formation of the tip links in the developing hair bundle, their turnover in the mature bundle, and their regeneration after intense acoustical stimulation to safeguard hearing.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a hitherto unknown process of structural remodeling of broken tip links necessary for regeneration of mechanotransduction in auditory hair cells. The transient PCDH15/PCDH15 links mediate mechanotransduction currents, while the mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanosensory function and may help identify elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery.

    **Title:** Metabolomic Profiling Reveals Altered Metabolic Pathways in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever

    **Background:** Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The mechanisms underlying the transition from DF to DHF are not well understood.

    **Research Question:** What are the metabolic changes associated with DHF in the critical and recovery phases of DENV infection?

    **Methods:** We performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DHF patients at the critical (5-7 days post-onset of fever) and recovery (21-28 days post-onset of fever) phases of infection.

    **Main Findings:** We identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF patients at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Notably, bile acids were up to 5-fold higher in DHF patients compared to DF patients, correlating with elevated liver injury markers aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). Conversely, uric acid levels were 1.5-fold lower in DHF patients, suggesting decreased endogenous antioxidant defense and elevated oxidative stress.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF in both the critical and recovery phases of dengue infection. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis and suggest potential novel therapeutic targets for dengue management.

    **Conclusions:** This study advances our understanding of the metabolic changes associated with DHF and highlights the importance of bile acids and uric acid in the pathogenesis of DHF. The identification of altered metabolic pathways in DHF patients may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate DHF and improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the potential of metabolomics as a diagnostic tool for DHF.
Title: Identification and Characterization of Guanosine 5’-Monophosphate Reductase (GMPR) in Trypanosoma brucei: A Novel Therapeutic Target for African Trypanosomiasis

    Abstract:
    The metabolic pathway of purine nucleotides in parasitic protozoa is a promising drug target for the treatment of parasitemia. Guanosine 5’-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) plays a crucial role in maintaining the intracellular balance of purine nucleotides by catalyzing the deamination of guanosine 5’-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP). Here, we report the identification and characterization of GMPR in Trypanosoma brucei, a causative protozoan parasite of African trypanosomiasis. Our results show that the GMPR protein is localized to glycosomes in T. brucei bloodstream forms and possesses a unique insertion of a tandem repeat of the cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain, which is absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant protein of T. brucei GMPR exhibits distinct enzymatic properties, including increased activity in the presence of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+, and inhibition by the monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the GMPR reaction in T. brucei is distinct from that in host organisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the potential of ribavirin as a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis. Our study provides new insights into the molecular characterization of GMPR in trypanosomatids and highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of guanosine 5’-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) in Trypanosoma brucei, a causative protozoan parasite of African trypanosomiasis?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemical techniques to identify and characterize GMPR in T. brucei. We performed sequence alignment analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and enzymatic assays to investigate the localization, structure, and function of GMPR in T. brucei.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that GMPR is localized to glycosomes in T. brucei bloodstream forms and possesses a unique insertion of a tandem repeat of the CBS domain, which is absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant protein of T. brucei GMPR exhibits distinct enzymatic properties, including increased activity in the presence of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+, and inhibition by the monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that the mechanism of the GMPR reaction in T. brucei is distinct from that in host organisms, providing new insights into the molecular characterization of GMPR in trypanosomatids. The inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner indicates the potential of ribavirin as a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the molecular characterization of GMPR in trypanosomatids and highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis. The unique enzymatic properties of T. brucei GMPR
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Sodium Channel Blockers: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Benzocaine and Phenytoin Binding to NavAb

    Abstract:
    The development of next-generation sodium channel blockers for the treatment of epileptic seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, and pain requires a deeper understanding of how current channel blockers interact with voltage-gated sodium channels. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding mechanism of benzocaine and phenytoin to the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb. Our results reveal two likely binding sites for both drugs, characterized by non-specific, hydrophobic interactions: one above the activation gate and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. Three independent methods consistently identify these sites, suggesting that binding to the activation gate is slightly more favorable than at the fenestration. Notably, both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with minimal energy barriers, supporting the long-proposed hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. Our simulations highlight the importance of specific residues in directing drug entry and binding site formation. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism of action of sodium channel blockers and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs with improved selectivity and efficacy.

    Research Question:
    How do benzocaine and phenytoin bind to the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb, and what are the implications for the development of next-generation sodium channel blockers?

    Methods:
    We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding mechanism of benzocaine and phenytoin to NavAb. The simulations were performed using three independent methods to validate the results.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that both benzocaine and phenytoin have two likely binding sites: one above the activation gate and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. Binding to the activation gate is slightly more favorable than at the fenestration. Both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with minimal energy barriers, supporting the hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs.

    Implications:
    These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism of action of sodium channel blockers and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs with improved selectivity and efficacy. Understanding the binding mechanism of benzocaine and phenytoin to NavAb can inform the development of new drugs that selectively target specific sodium channels, reducing the risk of off-target effects and improving treatment outcomes.

    Conclusions:
    Our molecular dynamics simulations provide a detailed understanding of the binding mechanism of benzocaine and phenytoin to NavAb, highlighting the importance of specific residues in directing drug entry and binding site formation. These findings have significant implications for the development of next-generation sodium channel blockers and can inform the design of new drugs with improved selectivity and efficacy.

    **Title:** Cell Type-Specific MyD88 Signaling in Host Defense against Intestinal Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the cell type-specific contribution of MyD88 in protecting the host against intestinal bacterial infection?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel murine knock-in model for MyD88 that enables the cell type-specific reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in otherwise MyD88-deficient mice to investigate the importance of MyD88 in specific immune and nonimmune cell types during intestinal infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that functional MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ cells, specifically in intestinal dendritic cells (DC), is sufficient to activate the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) response and the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to infection with the intestinal pathogen C. rodentium. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to macrophages (MO), T cells, or ILC3 did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses upon infection. However, we observed that the functional expression of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) also partially protected the mice during intestinal infection, associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide RegIIIγ and the acute phase protein SAA1 by epithelial cells.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that MyD88 signaling in DC and IEC is both essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium. These findings highlight the critical role of MyD88 in specific cell types during intestinal infection and provide new insights into the mechanisms of host defense against intestinal pathogens.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ cells, specifically in DC, is sufficient to activate the ILC3 response and protect mice during the early phase of infection with C. rodentium. Additionally, our results show that MyD88 signaling in IEC contributes to maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and protecting against intestinal infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of host defense against intestinal pathogens and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat intestinal infections.

    Title: Mathematical Modeling of Onchocerciasis Elimination: The Role of Ov16 Antibody Prevalence in Children

    Background: Onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease caused by Onchocerca volvulus, is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA). The Ov16 antibody test, which detects human IgG4 antibodies to the Onchocerca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16, is a recommended tool for determining whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop.

    Research Question: What is the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children, measured 1 year after the last round of MDA, and the duration and coverage of MDA, mf prevalence in the population, and the probability that onchocerciasis is eventually eliminated?

    Methods: The ONCHOSIM model was extended to include new output on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals. Seroconversion was assumed to be triggered by the first worm establishing in the host, with seroconversion occurring either before maturation, after maturation, or only after the start of mf production. Yearly repeated MDA leads to a strong reduction in the parasite acquisition rate in humans, which in turn reduces the seroconversion rate in newborns and young children.

    Main Findings: Both the microfilaridermia prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and the Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. The association between either of these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was not influenced much by the assumed treatment coverage levels, but was found to depend on baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity).

    Implications: Our study demonstrates that the endpoint for MDA will be dependent on baseline endemicity levels, which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA. Better understanding of the dynamics of Ov16 antibody responses is required for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and more precise estimation of endpoint for MDA.

    Conclusions: Mathematical modeling provides a useful tool for systematically assessing trends in infection indicators during mass treatment, under a range of different conditions and treatment scenarios. Our study highlights the importance of considering local transmission conditions, baseline endemicity levels, treatment duration and coverage, and diagnostic test characteristics when using the Ov16 antibody test to define when to stop MDA.

    **Title:** Emergence of Drug-Resistant and Dependent Prion Variants upon Propagation in the Presence of an Inhibitory Drug

    **Research Question:** Can prion populations adapt to become resistant or dependent on an inhibitory drug when propagated in the presence of the drug?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of swainsonine, an inhibitory drug, on the propagation of two prion strains, 22L and RML, in PK1 cells. We observed the emergence of drug-resistant and drug-dependent prion variants upon propagation in the presence of swainsonine.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that when 22L prions were propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of swainsonine, drug-resistant variants emerged. Similarly, RML prions, which are naturally swainsonine-sensitive, gave rise to swainsonine-resistant and even swainsonine-dependent populations when passaged in the presence of the drug. Notably, these adaptations were stable and could be passaged indefinitely in PK1 cells, even in the absence of the drug. We also found that the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) associated with the swainsonine-dependent variant was less rapidly cleared in PK1 cells than its drug-sensitive counterpart, suggesting that structural differences in the misfolded PrP underlie the properties of the prions.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that propagation of prions in the presence of an inhibitory drug can lead to the selection of drug-resistant and drug-dependent prion variants. These adaptations are likely due to conformational changes in the abnormal prion protein. Our results have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for prion diseases, as they highlight the potential for prions to adapt to and evade inhibitory drugs.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study demonstrates that prion populations can adapt to become resistant or dependent on an inhibitory drug when propagated in the presence of the drug. These findings support the proposal that prion strain populations are quasi-species, consisting of a major conformer and multiple variants that are constantly selected against and replenished by mutation. Our results have significant implications for our understanding of prion biology and the development of effective therapeutic strategies for prion diseases.

**Title:** Exploring the Evolutionary Potential of Metabolism: A Genotype-Phenotype Map of Central Carbon Metabolism

**Research Question:** What is the structure of the genotype-phenotype space of central carbon metabolism, and how does it define the evolutionary potential and limitations of an evolving system?

**Methods:** We constructed an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map for a space of 10^15 metabolisms that encodes all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism. We used flux balance analysis to predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that viable metabolisms with any one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, but their absolute numbers exceed 10^9 for some phenotypes. Metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through metabolic genotype space, where any two genotypes can be reached from each other through a series of single reaction changes. The minimal distance of genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, suggesting that one can reach metabolisms with novel phenotypes – viable on new carbon sources – through one or few genotypic changes. However, exceptions to these principles exist for metabolisms whose complexity (number of reactions) is close to the minimum needed for viability.

**Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolutionary potential of metabolism. Increasing metabolic complexity enhances the potential for both evolutionary conservation and evolutionary innovation. The structure of the genotype-phenotype space of central carbon metabolism defines the evolutionary potential and limitations of an evolving system, and our results provide a framework for understanding how metabolisms can adapt to changing environments.

**Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive map of the genotype-phenotype space of central carbon metabolism, revealing the intricate relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolutionary potential of metabolism and provide a framework for understanding how metabolisms can adapt to changing environments.

    **Title:** Phylogeography and Population Genetics of Triatoma dimidiata Haplogroups in the Mexican Neotropics: Implications for Trypanosoma cruzi Infection Prevalence and Vector Capacity

    **Research Question:** This study investigates the population genetics of Triatoma dimidiata haplogroups at landscape and sub-regional scales in Chiapas and regional level across the Mexican Neotropics, and re-analyzes the phylogeography of the complex across its complete geographic range.

    **Methods:** We analyzed two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene from T. dimidiata haplogroups 1, 2, and 3, using a previously designed sequence. We employed a landscape (anthropic modification gradient) and regional (demographic, fragmentation, biogeographic, climate) scale approach to investigate genetic diversity and Trypanosoma cruzi infection prevalence.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that lowest T. dimidiata genetic diversity occurs where there is greatest historical anthropic modification, and where T. cruzi infection prevalence is significantly highest. Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence was significantly higher than expected in haplogroups 1 and 3, while lower than expected in haplogroup 2. We also found significant differences in DTUI and DTUVI infection frequencies in both haplogroups 1 and 3, while no difference was observed in haplogroup 2.

    **Implications:** Our study provides evidence for recent divergence of three primary T. dimidiata haplogroups, with differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, which are important components of vector capacity. We also found that all haplogroups from the Mexican Neotropics had moderate to high haplotype diversity, with greatest genetic differentiation between haplogroups 1 and 3.

    **Conclusions:** This study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complex's origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus and provides new insights into the population genetics and phylogeography of T. dimidiata haplogroups in the Mexican Neotropics. Our findings have important implications for vector control programs, as at least haplogroup 1 has expanding populations in Mexico, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to prevent the spread of Chagas disease.
Title: Environmental Risk Factors Favoring Rodent-to-Human Transmission of Hantavirus: A 10-Year Field Surveillance Study in Chenzhou, China

    Abstract:

    Background: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, primarily Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) in China. Environmental factors significantly influence the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, mainly through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. This study aimed to elucidate the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission to inform effective HFRS prevention and control strategies.

    Methods: We analyzed 10-year (2006-2015) field surveillance data from rodent hosts for hantavirus, epidemiological and environmental data extracted from satellite images and meteorological stations, and rodent-to-human transmission rates to quantify the relationships among environmental factors, rodent species, and HFRS occurrence in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot.

    Main Findings: Our study revealed that rodent species in Chenzhou comprise mainly Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, R. flavipectus, and other species (R. losea and Microtus fortis calamorum). The rodent species played different roles across various land types, but all were associated with transmission risks. R. norvegicus and R. flavipectus were associated with HFRS occurrence risk in grassland, whereas M. musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The rodent community composition was also associated with environmental variability.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that cultivated land represents the highest risk for HFRS incidence, which aligns with the statistics for HFRS cases in 2014-2015. The spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease may be influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. Therefore, future work should focus on preventing HFRS in moist, warm environments.

    Conclusions: This study provides scientific evidence for developing effective HFRS prevention and control strategies by elucidating the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the complex relationships among environmental factors, rodent species, and HFRS occurrence to inform targeted interventions.

    **Title:** Identification of a Novel Germline Mutation in HRAS Exon 2 and Its Implications for Costello Syndrome and Cancer

    **Background:** Costello syndrome (CS) is a congenital disease caused by activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene, with the majority of cases resulting from heterozygous c.34G>A (p.Gly12Ser) mutations. However, the mechanisms underlying the variable phenotypes of CS and cancer are not fully understood.

    **Research Question:** What is the role of HRAS exon 2 splicing in determining the phenotype of CS and cancer, and can this knowledge be exploited for the development of new anti-cancer therapies?

    **Methods:** We identified a novel germline p.Gly12Val mutation, c.35_36GC>TG, in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. We analyzed the HRAS cDNA and found high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild-type and mutant HRAS minigenes, we confirmed that c.35_36GC>TG results in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creating an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that HRAS exon 2 is a vulnerable exon, dependent on the binding of splicing regulatory proteins to ESEs for correct inclusion in the HRAS mRNA. We demonstrate that mutations in codon 12 and 13 impact exon 2 inclusion differently, and that HRAS exon 2 splicing efficiency is cell-type specific. We also show that a splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE causes exon 2 skipping and halts proliferation of cancer cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the phenotype of CS and cancer is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins, but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of new anti-cancer therapies based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the variable phenotypes of CS and cancer, and highlights the potential of SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of this approach.

    **Title:** METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Modification Regulates Cerebellar Neurogenesis and Development in Mammals

    **Research Question:** What is the role of METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in regulating mammalian cerebellar development?

    **Methods:** We employed a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model to specifically inactivate Mettl3 in the nervous system and investigated the effects on cerebellar development. We analyzed the transcriptome-wide gene expression, RNA stability, and splicing events in the absence of METTL3.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that specific inactivation of Mettl3 in the mouse nervous system causes severe developmental defects in the brain, characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia due to drastically enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) in the external granular layer (EGL). We found that METTL3 depletion-induced loss of m6A modification leads to extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events, resulting in dysregulation of transcriptome-wide gene expression and premature CGC death.

    **Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that METTL3 is an essential regulator of cerebellar neurogenesis and development. The transcriptome-wide gene expression dysregulation induced by m6A depletion in the absence of METTL3 results in CGCs apoptosis and cerebellum hypoplasia. Our study highlights the critical role of METTL3-mediated m6A in regulating the development of the central nervous system at the post-transcriptional level in mammals.

    **Conclusions:** We conclude that METTL3 is a key regulator of cerebellar development, and its inactivation leads to severe cerebellar hypoplasia and premature CGC death. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of METTL3-mediated m6A modification in regulating mammalian cerebellar development and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for neurological disorders associated with cerebellar dysfunction.

    **Title:** Combinatorial Binding of Transcription Factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG Regulates Gene Expression in Embryonic Stem Cells and Early Development

    **Research Question:** What is the role of combinatorial binding of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in regulating gene expression in embryonic stem cells and early development?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the binding patterns of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in mouse and human embryonic stem cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We also examined the co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac, and the expression of nearby genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that combinatorial binding of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG is strongly associated with co-localization of Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes in embryonic stem cells. We observed that the same loci bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. Notably, while less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are shared between species, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved between mouse and human ES cells.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. This implies that conserved combinatorial binding events in ES cells have extensive downstream impact by controlling key regulatory genes involved in differentiation and provides further evidence for the tight connection between pluripotency and early development mediated by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG through binding at developmental enhancers.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of combinatorial binding of transcription factors in regulating gene expression in embryonic stem cells and early development. The conservation of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development suggests that these regulatory elements are under stronger evolutionary constraints, whereas individual binding events are more susceptible to evolutionary rewiring. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying embryonic development and the regulation of gene expression in stem cells.

    **Title:** AML1/ETO Oncogenic Transcription Factor Initiates Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Recruiting Co-repressor Complexes to DNA

    **Research Question:** How does the AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor initiate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA?

    **Methods:** Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and expression profiling were used to identify AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AML1/ETO was found to co-localize with its wild-type counterpart, AML1, and the E-protein HEB on many of its regulated targets.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that AML1/ETO interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by directly targeting AML1 binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation determined by AML1/ETO probably relies on a more complex network, as the fusion protein interacts with a number of other transcription factors, including E-proteins. The DNA binding profile of the E-protein HEB was grossly rearranged upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the fusion protein was found to co-localize with both AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing AML1/ETO.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest a major role for the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein. The co-localization of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets suggests that common binding regions for the three transcription factors are of relevance to AML1/ETO function.

    **Conclusions:** The AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor initiates acute myeloid leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA through its interactions with AML1 and HEB. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation and highlight the importance of the functional interaction between AML1/ETO, AML1, and HEB in the development of AML. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AML and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.

    **Title:** Chromatin Modifications and Gene Regulation in Leishmania donovani: Unveiling the Role of HAT2 in Cell Cycle Control

    **Research Question:** How does the Leishmania donovani histone acetyltransferase HAT2 regulate gene expression and cell cycle progression in this parasite?

    **Methods:** We employed in vitro biochemical assays and HAT2-heterozygous genomic knockout to investigate the function of HAT2 in Leishmania donovani. We also used real-time PCR, DNA microarray analyses, and rescue experiments to examine the effects of HAT2 depletion on gene expression and cell cycle progression.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that HAT2 is essential for the acetylation of histone H4K10 in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of HAT2 leads to growth and cell cycle defects, as well as poor survival in host cells. We found that the downregulation of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9 is responsible for the S phase and G2/M defects in HAT2-depleted cells, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that CYC4 and CYC9 have their own specific promoters, which are activated in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that there are two tiers of gene regulation in Leishmania donovani. Transcription of polycistronic units primarily initiates at divergent strand switch regions (dSSRs), while a subset of genes have their own promoters, which are activated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. This second tier of regulation is more sensitive to H4K10 acetylation levels, resulting in downregulation of expression in HAT2-depleted cells.

    **Conclusions:** This study presents the first data pointing to cell cycle-specific activation of promoters in trypanosomatids, uncovering new facets of gene regulation in this parasite family. Our results highlight the importance of stringent modulation of CYC4 and CYC9 expression in Leishmania donovani, and demonstrate the critical role of HAT2 in regulating gene expression and cell cycle progression in this parasite. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the biology of Leishmania donovani and may provide new targets for the development of antiparasitic therapies.

    **Title:** Inferring Volatile Intentions in Social Interactions: A Computational Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How do humans infer on others' potentially time-varying intentions during social transactions, and what are the underlying mechanisms that govern this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a meta-Bayesian modeling framework to analyze behavioral data from an economic game in which 16 pairs of volunteers (randomly assigned to "player" or "adviser" roles) interacted. The player performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, receiving information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart. The adviser, who received more predictive information, issued an additional recommendation. The game was structured to vary the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information over time.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others. We found that players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning, where they inferred upon the volatility of the advisers' intentions to optimize their predictions about the validity of their advice. Furthermore, our model predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that humans use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework presented here can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts, which may be useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. These findings have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition and may inform the development of novel interventions for social cognition disorders.

    **Title:** Indigenous Urban Scrub Typhus in Seoul, South Korea: Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics

    **Background:** Scrub typhus, a vector-borne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, has traditionally been considered a rural disease in Asia. However, recent cases have been reported in urban areas, including Seoul, South Korea. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul.

    **Methods:** We retrospectively analyzed national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013 to identify indigenous urban scrub typhus cases in Seoul. We selected patients from one hospital that reported the majority of cases and compared them to a historic control group. Chigger mites were prospectively collected in the city using a direct chigger mite-collecting trap and identified using phenotypic and 18S rDNA sequencing analyses. Infection with O. tsutsugamushi was confirmed by sequencing the 56-kDa antigen gene.

    **Main Findings:** Eighty-eight cases of urban scrub typhus were identified in Seoul, with possible sites of infection including mountainous areas, city parks, the vicinity of one’s own residence, and riversides. Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, with 76 (87.4%) identified as Helenicula miyagawai and 8 (9.2%) as Leptotrombidium scutellare. Pooled DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low APACHE II scores, low complication rates, and no hypokalemia.

    **Implications:** Our study confirms the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul and identifies a subgroup of patients with mild clinical features. The chigger mite H. miyagawai infected with O. tsutsugamushi within the city was found. These findings suggest that urban scrub typhus should be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases in endemic areas and a target for prevention.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first clinical description of urban scrub typhus in Seoul and confirms the presence of the Boryong genotype in chigger mites collected within the city. Further studies are needed to characterize the overall status of scrub typhus in Seoul and to determine the role of H. miyagawai mites in human infection.

    Title: HENN-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA–methyl-transferase homolog, modulates the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs in endogenous RNA interference pathways

    Research Question: How does the Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA–methyl-transferase homolog, HENN-1, affect the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs in endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathways?

    Methods: We investigated the effects of HENN-1 on the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs, which are two primary small RNA (sRNA) classes in C. elegans, using a combination of molecular biology and bioinformatics approaches.

    Main Findings: We found that HENN-1 differentially affects the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs. Specifically, most 26G RNAs display reduced stability and respond to loss of HENN-1 by displaying increased 3′-uridylation frequencies. In contrast, the stability of 21U RNAs, the C. elegans piRNAs, is only mildly affected by loss of methylation. Furthermore, we found that ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs are modified by HENN-1, while ALG-3/ALG-4-bound 26G RNAs are not. Global gene expression analysis of henn-1 mutants reveals mild effects, including down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes.

    Implications: Our data suggest that HENN-1 plays a crucial role in modulating the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs in endogenous RNAi pathways. The differential effects of HENN-1 on these two sRNA classes highlight the complexity of RNAi regulation in C. elegans. Our findings also suggest that HENN-1-mediated methylation of 26G RNAs has a stabilizing effect and prevents non-templated uridylation.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of endogenous RNAi in C. elegans and the roles of Hen1-like enzymes in these pathways. Our results demonstrate that HENN-1 is essential for the stability of 26G RNAs, particularly those bound by ERGO-1, and suggest that HENN-1-mediated methylation plays a critical role in preventing non-templated uridylation of these RNAs. These findings have important implications for our understanding of RNAi regulation in C. elegans and other organisms.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Association and Glycomics Analysis Reveals HNF1α as a Master Transcriptional Regulator of Fucosylation

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of fucosylation, a critical post-translational modification of proteins?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and high-throughput glycomics analysis of 2,705 individuals in three population cohorts to identify genetic variants associated with N-glycan levels in human plasma. We also performed gene expression analysis in HepG2 and Panc1 cell lines to investigate the role of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and its downstream target HNF4α in regulating fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that common variants in the HNF1α and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. We show that HNF1α and HNF4α regulate the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes, and that HNF1α is both necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. Notably, we identify HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. The identification of HNF1α as a key regulator of fucosylation provides new insights into the complex processes that govern this critical post-translational modification.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals a novel role for HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of fucosylation, and highlights the importance of HNF1α and HNF4α in regulating the expression of fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting HNF1α and its downstream targets.

    **Title:** Epigenetic Regulation of Centromere Specification by Centromeric RNA

    **Research Question:** How do centromeric RNAs contribute to the epigenetic regulation of centromere specification in maize?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genetic and biochemical study of maize CENPC, a key inner kinetochore protein, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that maize CENPC has both DNA-binding and RNA-binding capacities, and that the DNA/RNA-binding domain is localized to the exon duplication region. We found that single-stranded RNA strongly promotes the binding of CENPC to DNA, and that the types of RNAs that stabilize DNA binding match in size and character the RNAs present on kinetochores in vivo. Furthermore, removal or replacement of the binding module with HIV integrase binding domain causes a partial delocalization of CENPC in vivo.

    **Implications:** Our data suggest that centromeric RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. We propose that CENPC is first recruited to kinetochores by protein-protein contacts and then converted to a functional DNA binding protein by centromeric RNA. Our findings support the view that RNA facilitates or stabilizes the association of kinetochore proteins with centromeric DNA, and implicate CENPC as a primary target of this activity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the epigenetic regulation of centromere specification in maize. We demonstrate that centromeric RNA plays a crucial role in recruiting CENPC to the inner kinetochore, and that this process is mediated by the binding of single-stranded RNA to CENPC. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of centromere specification and kinetochore assembly, and suggest that epigenetic marks, such as centromeric RNA, are essential for the proper formation and function of centromeres.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Placental Transcriptome and eQTLs in Mediating Genetic Causes of Birth Weight, Childhood Obesity, and Childhood Body Mass Index

    **Research Question:** What is the role of placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in mediating the genetic causes of birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and childhood body mass index (CBMI)?

    **Methods:** We conducted an integrative analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI, and applied colocalization and MetaXcan analysis to examine the role of placental transcriptome and eQTLs in mediating these genetic causes. We compared placental eQTLs with eQTLs from seven adult tissues, including blood, atherosclerotic-lesion-free internal mammary artery, atherosclerotic aortic root, subcutaneous fat, visceral abdominal fat, skeletal muscle, and liver.

    **Main Findings:** We found that GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were substantially enriched for placental eQTLs (6.76, 4.83, and 2.26 folds, respectively). Importantly, compared to eQTLs of adult tissues, only placental eQTLs contributed significantly to both anthropometry outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI). We identified eight, six, and one transcripts that colocalized with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that placental transcription in utero likely plays a key role in determining postnatal body size, and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity. The findings demonstrate that the placenta is a highly relevant tissue for determining not only weight at birth but also body weight in childhood. Identifying the genes mediating the genetic predisposition for BW, CO, and CBMI is crucial for understanding the mechanisms controlling these traits and developing clinical prevention strategies.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of placental transcriptome and eQTLs in mediating the genetic causes of BW, CO, and CBMI. Our findings support the hypothesis that integrative genomics can be a powerful tool to mine GWAS results and identify new therapeutic targets for preventing childhood obesity.

    Title: Evaluation of Diagnostic Tools and Treatment Outcomes in Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in an Endemic Area of Malda District, West Bengal

    Background: Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic but non-life-threatening disease that often goes undiagnosed and untreated, posing a significant public health concern in the context of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) elimination. The lack of standard guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of PKDL necessitates the development of effective diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.

    Methods: This study aimed to determine the actual disease burden of PKDL in an endemic area of Malda district, West Bengal, and to compare the sensitivity of three diagnostic tools (PCR, slit skin smear, and rK-39 rapid diagnostic kit) for PKDL case detection. Twenty-six PKDL cases were identified through active surveillance and confirmed by PCR-based diagnosis. Patients were treated with either sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or oral miltefosine and followed up for two years to observe lesion regression.

    Main Findings: The prevalence of PKDL was 27.5% among antileishmanial antibody-positive cases. PCR was found to be the most sensitive diagnostic tool (88.46%) for case confirmation, followed by slit skin smear (15.38%) and rK-39 rapid diagnostic kit (0%). Lesions persisted in most cases after treatment completion but gradually disappeared within 6-12 months post-treatment. Reappearance of lesions was noted in two cases after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment.

    Implications: The study highlights the need for active mass surveys to detect PKDL cases, which would otherwise remain undiagnosed. The PCR-based method is a valuable tool for confirming PKDL diagnosis, and its implementation at the district or state level can aid in the elimination of Kala-azar. Further studies are required to determine when PKDL patients are free from parasites after treatment and to identify those who require longer treatment periods.

    Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of developing effective diagnostic tools and treatment strategies for PKDL, which is a significant public health concern in the context of VL elimination. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of evidence-based guidelines for PKDL diagnosis and treatment, ultimately aiding in the control and elimination of Kala-azar.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Pneumococcal Competence Development: A Two-Step Cell-Contact Sensing Process

    **Research Question:** How does the Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP)-dependent population switch in Streptococcus pneumoniae occur, and what is the role of cell-to-cell contact in this process?

    **Methods:** We monitored spontaneous competence development in real-time during growth of four distinct pneumococcal lineages in liquid cultures. We used co-cultivation experiments to investigate the role of CSP and cell-to-cell contact in competence development.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that competence shift in the population relies on a self-activated cell fraction that arises via a growth time-dependent mechanism. We found that CSP remains bound to cells during this event and that the rate of competence development corresponds to the propagation of competence by contact between activated and quiescent cells. We also demonstrated that the membrane protein ComD retains CSP, limiting its free diffusion in the medium.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that pneumococcal competence development is a two-step process: a fraction of cells initially switches to CSP over-expression, and these cells then induce competence in the whole population through cell-to-cell contact. This process promotes horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in pneumococci, contributing to their ability to evade vaccines, antibiotics, and host immune defenses.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that competence initiator cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a distinct subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell-cell contact. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying pneumococcal competence development and highlights the importance of cell-to-cell contact in this process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of pneumococcal biology and the development of strategies to combat pneumococcal infections.

    **Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) L2 Protein-Mediated Translocation across Intracellular Membranes

    **Research Question:** How does the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L2 protein facilitate the translocation of the viral genome (vDNA) across limiting intracellular membranes during infection?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel system based on subcellular compartmentalization of the enzyme BirA and its cognate substrate to detect membrane translocation of L2-BirA from incoming virions. We used this system to study the translocation of L2/vDNA in synchronized HaCaT cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that L2 translocation requires transport to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L2/vDNA at the TGN, while release and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and subsequent infection. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis, with vDNA egressing from the TGN to a pericentriolar location and associating with condensed chromosomes. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin binding region of L2 potently blocked translocation, suggesting that translocation is dependent on chromatin binding during prometaphase.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide the first evidence that a virus has functionally coupled the penetration of limiting membranes to cellular mitosis, explaining in part the tropism of HPV for mitotic basal keratinocytes. We propose that L2 translocation is dependent on the L2 CBR binding an unknown mitotic chromosome tethering factor that becomes available specifically during prometaphase.

    **Conclusions:** We have developed a novel system to directly study translocation of the L2/vDNA complex during papillomavirus infection. Our results reveal a critical role for mitosis in L2/vDNA translocation and highlight the importance of chromatin binding in this process. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HPV infection and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against HPV-related diseases.

    Title: Quantifying the Relative Transmissibility of Influenza Strains: A Mathematical Framework for Competitive Mixtures Experiments

    Research Question: Can we develop a method to measure the relative transmissibility (transmission fitness) of one strain of influenza compared to another, and apply it to data from competitive mixtures experiments in animals?

    Methods: We employed a mathematical framework to analyze data from competitive mixtures experiments in ferrets, where animals were co-infected with a mixture of two strains of influenza. We observed the mixture in each animal over time and over multiple generations of transmission.

    Main Findings: Our method allows for the estimation of the relative transmissibility of one strain compared to another, which is crucial in various contexts, including seasonal/seasonal interactions, seasonal/pandemic interactions, and NAI-resistant/NAI-sensitive interactions. We demonstrate the framework's behavior using data from ferret transmission studies and suggest how to optimize experimental design for assessing transmissibility. Our method also provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum, which is essential for parameterizing epidemiological models of influenza transmission.

    Implications: The relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another is critical in determining the likely time-course and epidemiology of an influenza outbreak or the potential impact of an intervention measure such as NAI distribution. Our method has wide applicability in influenza research and can be extended to other viral and bacterial pathogens.

    Conclusions: We present a novel method for assessing the relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of influenza transmission. Our approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the emergence and spread of NAI-resistant strains and inform the development of effective intervention strategies. The mathematical framework introduced here can be applied to other pathogens, making it a valuable tool for understanding the transmission dynamics of various infectious diseases.

    **Title:** BBX21 Integrates Light and Abscisic Acid Signaling to Regulate Seed Germination and Seedling Development in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** How do plants integrate external light signals with endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) pathways for better adaptation and survival?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of BBX21, a B-box protein previously shown to positively regulate seedling photomorphogenesis, in ABA signaling during seed germination and early seedling development in Arabidopsis thaliana.

    **Main Findings:** Our genetic data show that BBX21 acts upstream of several ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) in ABA control of seed germination. We demonstrate that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. Additionally, ABI5 was shown to directly activate its own expression, whereas BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. Our study indicates that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter, integrating light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between light and ABA signaling during seed germination and early seedling development. The integration of external light signals with endogenous ABA pathways is crucial for plant adaptation and survival, and our study highlights the role of BBX21 as a key regulator of this process.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that BBX21, a transcriptional regulator implicated in regulating seedling photomorphogenesis, negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. This suggests that multiple transcription factors in the light signaling pathway may regulate ABA responses by regulating ABI5 expression. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana and have implications for the development of strategies to improve plant adaptation and survival under various environmental stresses.

    Title: Conservation and Divergence of Mediator Complex Functions in the Pathogenic Fungus Candida albicans

    Background: The Mediator complex is a conserved co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that plays a crucial role in eukaryotic gene expression. While its functions have been extensively studied in model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, its role in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: What are the functions of the Mediator complex in C. albicans, and how do they compare to those in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe?

    Methods: We investigated the roles of Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 subunits of the Mediator complex in C. albicans using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and phenotypic analyses.

    Main Findings: Our results show that C. albicans Mediator shares some conserved functions with S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, including roles in stress response and gene expression regulated by the activator Ace2. However, C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of virulence-related genes, such as those involved in morphogenesis and adhesion. Notably, Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, including filamentation and biofilm formation. We also found that ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med31 for biofilm development, and that Med31 affects virulence of C. albicans in the worm infection model.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the Mediator complex plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of C. albicans, and that its subunits regulate adhesion in a distinct manner between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. These results have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying C. albicans pathogenesis and for the development of new therapeutic strategies against this opportunistic pathogen.

    Conclusions: In summary, our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of Mediator functions in C. albicans and highlights the conservation and divergence of Mediator-dependent gene regulation between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying C. albicans pathogenesis and for the development of new therapeutic strategies against this opportunistic pathogen.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Functional Profiling Reveals State-Specific Genetic Determinants of Antibiotic Tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms

    **Research Question:** What is the degree to which the biofilm-specific cellular state and its constituent genetic determinants contribute to the hyper-tolerant phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to antibiotics?

    **Methods:** We employed genome-wide functional profiling of a complex, heterogeneous mutant population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 in biofilm and planktonic growth conditions with and without tobramycin. A transposon mutagenesis and genetic footprinting technology was adapted and optimized for P. aeruginosa to quantify the contribution of each locus to tobramycin tolerance in the biofilm and planktonic states.

    **Main Findings:** Our mixed population-based experimental design recapitulated the complexity of natural biofilms and revealed clinically observed behaviors, including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants. We identified large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only, offering global insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance.

    **Implications:** Our study revealed a substantial contribution of the cellular state to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our comprehensive and systematic examination of the genetic determinants of antibiotic tolerance in P. aeruginosa biofilms and planktonic cells highlights the importance of considering the cellular state in the development of effective treatments against biofilm-associated infections. The identification of state-specific genetic determinants of antibiotic tolerance offers new avenues for the design of targeted therapies to combat P. aeruginosa biofilm infections.

    **Title:** Development of a Flexible and Dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection (FAMoS) to Analyze Complex Biological Systems

    **Research Question:** How can we develop a computational algorithm that efficiently searches large model spaces to provide a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics in complex biological systems?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel algorithm, Flexible and Dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection (FAMoS), designed to analyze complex systems dynamics within large model spaces. FAMoS incorporates local and non-local search methods to prevent getting stuck in local minima and account for structurally similar processes. We tested and validated FAMoS using simulated data and demonstrated its flexibility in handling different model structures.

    **Main Findings:** Our analyses of experimental data on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultured under different conditions revealed dynamical changes in cell proliferation potential, with reduced proliferation in tissue-like 3D ex vivo cultures compared to suspension. FAMoS efficiently searched large model spaces and provided a systematic description of the experimentally observed dynamics.

    **Implications:** The development of FAMoS addresses the need for computational algorithms that can handle complex and large model spaces, providing a useful tool for data-oriented evaluation of biological systems. FAMoS's flexibility in handling various model structures makes it applicable to a wide range of biological problems.

    **Conclusions:** FAMoS represents a significant contribution to the analysis of complex biological systems, enabling the identification of relevant factors and processes that determine system behavior. By efficiently searching large model spaces, FAMoS provides a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics, which is essential for understanding the behavior of complex biological systems. The algorithm's flexibility and dynamic nature make it a valuable tool for the analysis of various biological problems, from cell proliferation dynamics to other complex systems.

    **Title:** Evaluation of Benznidazole Treatment Efficacy in School-Age Children with Chronic Chagas Disease: A 12-Month Follow-Up Study

    **Background:** Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Bolivia. The National Program for Chagas disease implemented vector control measures, followed by a treatment regimen of benznidazole (BNZ) in seropositive school-age children living in certified vector control areas.

    **Research Question:** What is the efficacy of BNZ treatment in seropositive school-age children with chronic Chagas disease, and can plasma levels of IL-17A cytokine be used as a biomarker for detecting persistent infection?

    **Methods:** A 12-month follow-up study was conducted on 103 seropositive children, with seven blood samples taken during and after treatment. Serology, conventional diagnostic PCR (cPCR), and quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) were performed to evaluate treatment efficacy. Plasma Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines levels, including IL-17A, were also determined.

    **Main Findings:** Among 57 children who completed follow-up, 6 (11%) showed both cPCR (+) and qPCR (+), 24 (42%) cPCR (-) but qPCR (+), and 27 (47%) cPCR (-) and qPCR (-). IL-17A levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children and decreased to normal levels one year after treatment. IL-17A levels were positively correlated with parasite counts detected by qPCR.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that IL-17A might be a useful biomarker for detecting persistent infection and reactivity to BNZ treatment. The results also highlight the need for further study of host and parasite factors contributing to treatment failure in the non-reactive group.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of BNZ treatment in school-age children with chronic Chagas disease and the potential use of IL-17A as a biomarker for detecting persistent infection. The findings have significant implications for the development of more effective treatment strategies and the monitoring of treatment efficacy in Chagas disease patients.

    **Title:** Bioinformatic Analysis of the Correia Element in Neisseria meningitidis Reveals Subtype-Specific Promoters and Recombinational Class Switching

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the Correia element, a diminutive transposon, in the transcriptional regulation of Neisseria meningitidis, the primary causative agent of bacterial meningitis?

    **Methods:** We conducted a bioinformatic analysis of the Correia element in three meningococcal genomes, identifying eight subtypes with four distinct types of ends. Transcriptional analysis using PCR and a lacZ reporter system revealed that two ends encode strong promoters, with the activity of the strongest promoter dictated by a recurrent polymorphism (Y128) at the right end of the element.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the Correia element drives transcription of adjacent genes and may express small non-coding RNAs. Pair-wise comparisons between the three meningococcal genomes showed that no more than two-thirds of Correia elements maintain their subtype at any particular locus, due to recombinational class switching between elements in a single strain. This process may represent a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for phase variation in the meningococcus.

    **Implications:** The strain-to-strain variability of the Correia elements and the large number of strong promoters encoded by them allows for potentially widespread effects within the population as a whole. This may contribute to the development or persistence of hypervirulent lineages that are the source of most global meningococcal disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of the Correia element in the transcriptional regulation of Neisseria meningitidis. By defining the strength of the promoters encoded by the eight subtypes of Correia ends, we provide a resource that allows the transcriptional effects of a particular subtype at a given locus to be predicted. This knowledge may have significant implications for our understanding of meningococcal disease and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Title: LaeA and VeA Coordinate Secondary Metabolism and Differentiation in Response to Light Signals in Aspergillus spp.

    Abstract:
    In this study, we investigated the role of LaeA and VeA in regulating secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light signals in Aspergillus spp. We identified their orthologs, ChLae1 and ChVel1, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus, which produces a wealth of secondary metabolites, including the host-selective toxin T-toxin. Our results show that T-toxin production is significantly increased in the dark in wild-type (WT) strains, whereas Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutant toxin levels are much reduced in the dark compared to WT. Furthermore, expression of T-toxin biosynthetic genes (Tox1) is up-regulated in the dark in WT, while dark-induced expression is much reduced/minimal in Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutants.

    We found that overexpression of ChVEL1 increases T-toxin production in the dark, while overexpression of ChLAE1 increases T-toxin production in both light and dark conditions. These observations establish ChLae1 and ChVel1 as the first factors known to regulate host-selective toxin production. Our data also suggest that ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate T-toxin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, and super-virulence, oxidative stress responses, sexual development, and aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation.

    Notably, deletion of ChLAE1 or ChVEL1 reduces tolerance to H2O2, and expression of CAT3, one of the three catalase genes, is reduced in the Chvel1 mutant. Chlae1 and Chvel1 mutants also show decreased aerial hyphal growth, increased asexual sporulation, and female sterility. In contrast, ChLAE1 overexpression strains are female sterile, while ChVEL1 overexpression strains are more fertile than WT.

    Our results demonstrate that ChLae1 and ChVel1 regulate T-toxin production through transcriptional control of Tox1 genes. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying secondary metabolism and differentiation in Aspergillus spp. and highlight the importance of LaeA and VeA in regulating these processes in response to light signals.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Selective Ion Permeation in Bacterial Nav Channels through Non-Equilibrium Simulations

    Abstract:

    Background: Bacterial Nav channels have been characterized as functionally asymmetric, with the mechanism of this asymmetry remaining unclear. To address this question, we employed a novel approach combining non-equilibrium simulation data with two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Analysis Methods for multiple ions traversing the selectivity filter of bacterial NavAb channel.

    Research Question: What is the mechanism of selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels?

    Methods: We used non-equilibrium simulation data and two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes to investigate the movement of K+ and Na+ ions through the selectivity filter of bacterial NavAb channel.

    Main Findings: Our results indicate that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of NavAb in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction, but not in the outward direction. This block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions that can be ‘locked’ in place by modest applied forces. In contrast, three Na+ ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose “knock-on” mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions, with no similar local minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy landscape of two Na+ ions for a block state.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels, which differs from those identified from either crystal structures or equilibrium free-energy landscapes. The results are consistent with electrophysiological measurements of bacterial Nav channels.

    Conclusions: The inclusion of non-equilibrium factors in simulations can provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from either crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes. Our results highlight the importance of considering non-equilibrium effects in understanding the behavior of ion channels, and provide a new perspective on the mechanism of selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels.

    Supporting Text: Our non-equilibrium pulling simulations using NavAb suggest that a “pass-by” configuration for potassium ions in the presence of external forces can block the selectivity filter in bacterial Nav channels and prevent the permeation of K+ ions at small negative voltages in the inward direction, even though such a block state is unstable in the equilibrium free-energy landscape. These values coincide with the experimentally observed applied potentials for bacterial Nav channels to induce inward currents of K+ ions in bi-ionic conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation through bacterial Nav channels have predicted unperturbed-free-energy barrier differences for permeation of Na+ and K+ of 1–3 kcal/mol that are consistent with estimates for the PNa/PK permeability ratio of 20–40 obtained from experimental values for reversal potentials obtained for eukaryotic Nav channels under bi-ionic conditions.

    **Title:** Comparative Analysis of Rabies Virus Colonization in Furious and Paralytic Forms of Canine Rabies

    **Research Question:** What is the pattern of rabies virus colonization in the central nervous system (CNS) of dogs with furious and paralytic forms of rabies, and how does it differ between the two clinical forms?

    **Methods:** A cohort of 10 naturally infected non-vaccinated dogs (5 furious and 5 paralytic) was sacrificed shortly after developing illness. Rabies viral antigen was quantitatively assessed in cell processes and neuronal cell bodies at different levels of the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebrum using image analysis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes decreased in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of antigen in neuronal cell bodies and the percentage of involved cell bodies. However, there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, consistent with replication occurring in the cell body region and subsequent transport out to cell processes. Notably, greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in dogs with the furious compared to paralytic form, at all anatomic levels examined.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. Possible mechanisms might involve host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, which could be cytokine-mediated, as previous studies have documented greater inflammation in the paralytic form.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the pattern of rabies virus colonization in the CNS of dogs with furious and paralytic forms of rabies. The results suggest that the furious form of rabies is characterized by a more rapid viral colonization of the cerebral hemispheres, while the paralytic form is associated with slower viral propagation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of rabies and may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.

    **Title:** Identification of CTCF Binding Sites and Consensus Sequence in Drosophila: Implications for Insulator Function in the Bithorax Complex

    **Research Question:** What are the binding sites and consensus sequence of the zinc-finger protein CTCF in Drosophila, and how do they relate to insulator function in the Bithorax Complex (BX-C)?

    **Methods:** Chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis (ChIP-array) was used to identify CTCF binding sites in representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the BX-C, and the Antennapedia complex.

    **Main Findings:** We identified CTCF binding sites in the BX-C that map precisely to the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. Additionally, we located three additional presumptive insulator elements, "Fab-2," "Fab-3," and "Fab-4." Our data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning.

    **Implications:** The identification of CTCF binding sites and consensus sequence in Drosophila provides new insights into the regulation of gene expression in the BX-C. Our findings support the domain model of BX-C regulation, which posits that CTCF plays a key role in partitioning regulatory elements into independent chromatin loop domains.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that CTCF is a crucial component of insulator function in the BX-C, and that its binding sites are conserved across different regions of the Drosophila genome. The identification of a CTCF binding site consensus sequence provides a framework for understanding the mechanisms of insulator function and gene regulation in Drosophila. These findings have implications for our understanding of gene regulation in other organisms, including vertebrates, where CTCF has been well-studied as an enhancer-blocking factor.
Title: Elucidating the Induced-Fit Mechanism of Enzyme Inhibition: A Structural and Kinetic Analysis of Actinonin-Peptide Deformylase Interactions

    Abstract:

    Background: Enzyme-substrate recognition is a fundamental process in biochemistry, often coupled to conformational changes that facilitate catalysis. However, the adaptive substrate recognition mechanism has been poorly characterized at a structural level due to its dynamic nature.

    Research Question: What is the detailed mechanism of an induced-fit process at atomic resolution in the actinonin-peptide deformylase system?

    Methods: We employed a slow, tight-binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actinonin-peptide deformylase, and solved crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state, as well as several intermediate mimics captured during the process. Biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses were integrated to reconstruct the sequence of events leading from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme.

    Main Findings: Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is finally "zipped up" by additional binding interactions. A "movie" that reconstructs this entire process can be further extrapolated to catalysis.

    Implications: This study provides a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at atomic resolution, shedding light on the slow-binding mechanism of actinonin-peptide deformylase interactions. The findings have implications for understanding the broader area of receptor-ligand interactions, particularly in the context of slow, tight-binding inhibitors, which are favored for use as therapeutics due to their unique inhibitory properties.

    Conclusions: Our work integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to reconstruct the whole picture of the slow-binding mechanism, providing a better understanding of the induced-fit mechanism of enzyme inhibition and catalysis. The precise structural inhibitory mechanism of actinonin, a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of peptide deformylase, is elucidated, highlighting the importance of conformational effects during the formation of the hydrogen bond, aligning the substrate as an additional beta-sheet and eventually stabilizing the entire enzyme-ligand complex.

    **Title:** Deciphering the Role of Cortical Feedback in Thalamic Signal Transfer Efficiency

    **Research Question:** How does cortical feedback influence the transfer efficiency of sensory information from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex?

    **Methods:** Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we implemented a hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway combining biological cells and simulated circuits. We mimicked the synaptic bombardment of cortical origin through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed a novel control mechanism resulting from the collective resonance of all thalamic relay neurons. We found that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: (i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, (ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and (iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. Counterintuitively, our results demonstrate that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. This network regulation mechanism could direct an attentional focus to specific thalamic subassemblies and select the appropriate input lines to the cortex according to the descending influence of cortically-defined “priors.”

    **Conclusions:** Our study proposes that active decorrelation of background synaptic activity in the thalamic layer provides a powerful optimization mechanism controlling the efficiency of the retinocortical signal transfer. We propose that a stochastic facilitation process emerging at the whole thalamic population level enhances the global sensory information transfer in the presence of decorrelated corticogeniculate feedback bombardment. This process may be the basis for attentional modulation of sensory signals at the thalamic level. Our results have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying sensory processing and attentional modulation in the brain.
Title: NMAD-1, a Putative DNA Demethylase, Regulates Meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans by Modulating DNA Replication and Repair

    Abstract:
    The biological functions of nucleic acid methylation, beyond the well-characterized C5-position of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of NMAD-1, a putative DNA demethylase, in regulating meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our genetic analysis reveals that nmad-1 mutants exhibit reduced fertility, defective prophase I of meiosis, and an increased incidence of males due to aberrant chromosomal segregation. RNA sequencing of the nmad-1 germline shows reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes, coupled with delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identify NMAD-1 binding proteins, including topoisomerase TOP-2, which co-localizes with NMAD-1 on chromatin. Our results suggest that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis. These findings provide genetic evidence for a critical role of NMAD-1 in meiosis and highlight the importance of DNA demethylation in this process.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of NMAD-1, a putative DNA demethylase, in regulating meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans?

    Methods:
    We generated nmad-1 deletion and catalytic mutant strains and performed a detailed phenotypic and cytological analysis to examine the effects of NMAD-1 deficiency on meiosis. RNA sequencing of the nmad-1 germline was used to identify changes in gene expression. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were employed to identify NMAD-1 binding proteins.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that nmad-1 mutants exhibit reduced fertility, defective prophase I of meiosis, and an increased incidence of males due to aberrant chromosomal segregation. RNA sequencing reveals reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes, coupled with delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identify NMAD-1 binding proteins, including topoisomerase TOP-2, which co-localizes with NMAD-1 on chromatin.

    Implications:
    Our findings provide genetic evidence for a critical role of NMAD-1 in meiosis and highlight the importance of DNA demethylation in this process. The identification of NMAD-1 binding proteins, including TOP-2, suggests that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis.

    Conclusions:
    Our study demonstrates that NMAD-1, a putative DNA demethylase, plays a critical role in regulating meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans by modulating DNA replication and repair. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the biological functions of nucleic acid methylation and the regulation of meiosis in eukaryotes.
Title: Identification of Adipocyte Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein (APMAP) as a Novel Modulator of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Infection

    Abstract:
    Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause significant morbidity in newborns and immunocompromised patients. Despite its large genome and complex glycoprotein complexes, the mechanism of HCMV infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) as a novel modulator of HCMV infection. Using a combination of biochemical assays and cell culture experiments, we demonstrate that APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Knockdown of APMAP expression significantly reduced HCMV infection in these cells, while ectopic expression of human APMAP in cells refractory to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, promoted HCMV infection. Biochemical studies suggest that APMAP interacts with gH/gL-containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediates the nucleus translocation of tegument protein pp65. Our findings indicate that APMAP plays a critical role in the early stage of HCMV infection and is an important player in the complex HCMV infection mechanism. These results have significant implications for our understanding of HCMV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat HCMV infection.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) in the early stage of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of biochemical assays and cell culture experiments to identify APMAP as a novel modulator of HCMV infection. We knocked down APMAP expression in epithelial cells and fibroblasts and observed a significant reduction in HCMV infection. We also ectopically expressed human APMAP in cells refractory to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, and observed an increase in HCMV infection.

    Main Findings:
    Our results demonstrate that APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Knockdown of APMAP expression significantly reduced HCMV infection in these cells, while ectopic expression of human APMAP promoted HCMV infection in cells refractory to HCMV infection. Biochemical studies suggest that APMAP interacts with gH/gL-containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediates the nucleus translocation of tegument protein pp65.

    Implications:
    Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of HCMV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat HCMV infection. APMAP may serve as a potential target for the development of antiviral therapies.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study identifies APMAP as a novel modulator of HCMV infection and highlights the importance of APMAP in the early stage of HCMV infection. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of APMAP in HCMV pathogenesis and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

    **Title:** Autoregulation of Transcription Factors and Lineage-Specific Receptors in Hematopoiesis: A Minimal Model of Multilineage Commitment

    **Research Question:** How do cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements of regulation interact to inform cell commitment decisions in hematopoiesis, and what is the role of cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback in multilineage differentiation?

    **Methods:** We developed a minimal model that combines cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements of regulation to understand how instructive and stochastic events contribute to cell commitment decisions in hematopoiesis. Our model incorporates lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokine receptors, and we used simulations to investigate the effects of cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback on multilineage differentiation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. Our model supports both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are ultimately driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating these inherently noisy cell-fate decisions. We also found that the kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting progenitor state as well as the route of commitment chosen.

    **Implications:** Our model provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis, which have been observed experimentally. Our results suggest that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback plays a crucial role in instructing lineage choice and biasing cell-fate decisions in hematopoiesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements of regulation in understanding cell commitment decisions in hematopoiesis. By incorporating cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback into our model, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex behaviors that underlie multilineage differentiation. Our findings have implications for our understanding of hematopoiesis and may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for hematological disorders.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Ultrastructure of Bunyamwera Virus: A Prototypic Member of the Orthobunyavirus Genus

    **Research Question:** What is the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, the prototypic member of the Orthobunyavirus genus, and how does it contribute to our understanding of virus assembly and entry?

    **Methods:** Using electron cryo-tomography, we investigated the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to 3-nm resolution.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that BUNV virions are pleomorphic in shape, displaying a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protrudes 18 nm from the viral membrane and undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change upon introduction to an acidic environment. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and exhibits a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein–protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens. The trimeric assembly of the glycoprotein spike deviates from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater than anticipated repertoire of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first detailed 3-D structural analysis of an orthobunyavirus and a model for this large group of medically important viruses. Our results support a unique mode of fusion glycoprotein oligomerization, dissimilar to that observed in the currently known classes of fusion glycoproteins. The pleomorphic nature of orthobunyaviruses renders single particle averaging methods used for structure determination of entire virions incongruous, highlighting the importance of electron cryo-tomography in resolving the ultrastructure of this group of emerging viruses.
Title: Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies ABCC5 as a Novel Risk Gene for Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma in Asian Populations

    Abstract:
    Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, particularly in Asian populations. Anterior chamber depth (ACD) is a critical anatomical risk factor for PACG. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 5,308 individuals of Asian descent to investigate the genetic underpinnings of ACD and its association with PACG. Our study identified a genome-wide significant association at the ABCC5 locus (rs1401999), which was replicated in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PACG cases and 18,801 controls. The ABCC5 variant was associated with an increased risk of PACG (per-allele OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.22, P = 0.00046). Notably, the association was strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles was included in the analysis (per-allele OR = 1.30, P = 7.45 × 10^(-9)). Our findings suggest that genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions may contribute to the increased risk of PACG. The identification of ABCC5 as a novel risk gene for PACG provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying this major global cause of blindness.

    Methods:
    We conducted a two-stage study, first a GWAS on 4,484 population-based individuals of Indian and Malay ethnicity from Singapore and Chinese from Beijing, China, and second, the identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ACD were assessed for association in PACG case cohorts.

    Main Findings:
    Our study identified a genome-wide significant association at the ABCC5 locus (rs1401999), which was replicated in a separate case-control study. The ABCC5 variant was associated with an increased risk of PACG, and the association was strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles was included in the analysis.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions may contribute to the increased risk of PACG. The identification of ABCC5 as a novel risk gene for PACG provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying this major global cause of blindness.

    Conclusions:
    Our study highlights the importance of ACD as a critical anatomical risk factor for PACG and identifies ABCC5 as a novel risk gene for PACG in Asian populations. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional mechanisms underlying the association between ABCC5 and PACG. Re-sequencing of the ABCC5 region will be necessary to identify novel potentially functional polymorphisms related to PACG pathogenesis.

    **Title:** Identification of Bilaterian Conserved Regulatory Elements (Bicores): Bridging the Gap between Deuterostomes and Protostomes

    **Research Question:** Do conserved cis-regulatory elements exist between deuterostomes and protostomes, and if so, what are their characteristics and functions?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of genomic sequences from deuterostomes and protostomes to identify conserved regulatory elements. We used bioinformatics tools to predict transcription factor binding sites and enhancer activity, and validated our findings through experimental evidence.

    **Main Findings:** We identified the first examples of developmental enhancers conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes, which we term Bilaterian Conserved Regulatory Elements (Bicores). Bicores show sequence conservation and gene synteny, reflecting conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. We predict that Bicores act as response elements to signaling pathways and function as developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system.

    **Implications:** The discovery of Bicores has significant implications for our understanding of animal evolution and development. Bicores offer a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how this logic evolves. The existence of conserved cis-regulatory elements between deuterostomes and protostomes suggests that these two clades share a common developmental toolkit.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the first examples of cis-regulatory elements conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes. While the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the two clades, we predict that additional Bicores will be revealed as our understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilaterian genomes continue to grow. The discovery of Bicores opens up new avenues for research into the evolution and development of animal body plans, and highlights the importance of conserved cis-regulatory elements in shaping developmental processes.
Title: Investigating the Impact of Vaccine-Induced Immunity on Intra-Host Diversity of Influenza A Virus: A Randomized Controlled Trial

    Abstract:

    Background: Influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift are well-characterized on a global scale, but the factors influencing rapid evolution within and between human hosts remain unclear. Given the modest effectiveness of seasonal vaccination, vaccine-induced antibody responses may serve as a selective pressure for novel influenza variants at the individual or community level.

    Research Question: Does vaccine-induced immunity impact the intrahost diversity of influenza A virus during natural infection?

    Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy and used next-generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. We obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples and used a stringent analysis pipeline to identify intrahost single nucleotide variants at ≥1% frequency.

    Main Findings: Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers, respectively. We found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. These results have important implications for understanding the evolutionary patterns of influenza virus and may inform the development of more effective vaccination strategies.

    Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into the relationship between vaccine-induced immunity and the intrahost diversity of influenza virus during natural infection. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the evolutionary forces shaping the genetic structure of viral populations within hosts and the impact of host immune status on influenza virus evolution.

    **Title:** Immunogenicity of Genetically Modified Live Attenuated Leishmania donovani Parasites in Young and Aged Mice

    **Research Question:** Can genetically modified live attenuated Leishmania donovani parasites (LdCen-/-) induce a protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in both young and aged mice?

    **Methods:** In this study, we analyzed the immunogenicity of LdCen-/- parasites in young (2 months) and aged (18 months) mice. We evaluated the innate and adaptive immune responses in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and splenic dendritic cells from both age groups after in vitro infection with LdCen-/- parasites. We also assessed the protective immunity induced by LdCen-/- immunization in young and aged mice against virulent L. donovani challenge.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed that LdCen-/- infection significantly enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) genes in BMDCs from both young and aged mice compared to LdWT-infected mice. Immunization with LdCen-/- induced higher IgG2a antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses, and stimulated splenocytes for heightened leishmanicidal activity associated with nitric oxide production in young and aged mice. Upon virulent L. donovani challenge, LdCen-/- immunized mice from both age groups displayed multifunctional Th1-type CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, correlating to a significantly reduced parasite burden in the spleen and liver compared to naïve mice.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that LdCen-/- immunization induced a significant but diminished host protective response in aged mice after challenge with virulent L. donovani parasites compared to young mice. The reduced adaptive response in aged animals correlated with less protection in old mice compared to young mice.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the immunogenicity of LdCen-/- parasites in young and aged mice and highlights the importance of age in determining the clinical outcome of VL. Our results suggest that LdCen-/- immunization may be a promising approach for the development of a vaccine against VL, particularly in young individuals. However, further studies are needed to improve the efficacy of LdCen-/- immunization in aged individuals.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Capsid Proteins in Enteric and Respiratory Enterovirus Pathogenesis

    Abstract:
    Enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) exhibit distinct biophysical properties and cause a wide range of human pathologies, despite their genetic similarities. To investigate the underlying causes of these differences, we generated chimeras at the capsid level between EV-D68, a respiratory EV, and EV-D94, an enteric EV. Our results show that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine acid sensitivity, tissue tropism, and optimal growth temperature in EVs. Specifically, we found that EV-D94 with the capsid and 2A protease or the capsid only of EV-D68 were viable, and functional assays indicated that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that capsid genes participate in determining the optimal growth temperature, as EV-D94 temperature adaptation relied on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. Additionally, we showed that EV-D68 maintains residual binding capacity after acid treatment, despite a loss of infectivity. In contrast, non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues. These findings expose another layer of phenotypic diversity in one of the world's most prevalent pathogens and provide insights that could aid in target selection for vaccine or antiviral development.

    Research Question:
    What are the genetic regions responsible for the differences in key determinants of viral viability, including acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, tissue tropism, and induction of innate immunity, between enteric and respiratory enteroviruses?

    Methods:
    We generated chimeras at the capsid level between EV-D68 and EV-D94 using recombinant technology and assessed the viability, tropism, acid sensitivity, temperature adaptation, and interplay with host innate immunity of the chimeras.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine acid sensitivity, tissue tropism, and optimal growth temperature in EVs. We also found that non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues.

    Implications:
    These findings provide insights into the biophysical and immunogenic roles of capsid proteins in EV pathogenesis and may guide the search for therapeutic targets.

    Conclusions:
    Our study clarifies the diverse biophysical and immunogenic roles of capsid proteins in EV pathogenesis and highlights the importance of understanding the genetic regions responsible for the differences in key determinants of viral viability. These findings have implications for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies against EVs.

    **Title:** HSV-1 Glycoprotein gE-gI Mediates Clearance of Viral Antigens and Anti-Viral IgG through Antibody Bipolar Bridging

    **Research Question:** How does the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI facilitate the clearance of viral antigens and anti-viral immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the surface of infected cells?

    **Methods:** We developed an in vitro model system to investigate the trafficking of antibody bipolar bridging (ABB) complexes involving the HSV-1 Fc receptor gE-gI, the HSV-1 antigen gD, and IgGs. Human HeLa cells were co-expressed with gE-gI and gD, and then incubated with IgGs that could or could not form bridged complexes.

    **Main Findings:** Our data showed that cells expressing gE-gI and gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE-gI can mediate the clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses.

    **Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of viral immune evasion and pathogenesis. The ability of gE-gI to clear viral antigens and anti-viral IgG from the surface of infected cells represents a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that gE-gI plays a crucial role in the clearance of viral antigens and anti-viral IgG from the surface of infected cells through ABB. This process allows HSV-1 to evade IgG-mediated immune responses, highlighting the importance of gE-gI in viral pathogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of viral immune evasion and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HSV-1 infections.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Metabolic Adaptation of Echinococcus granulosus Protoscoleces through Transcriptome Analysis of Excretory-Secretory Proteins

    **Research Question:** How do Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces (PSCs) subvert the immune response of hosts and maintain metabolic adaptation?

    **Methods:** We employed Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis to explore the transcriptome profiles of E. granulosus PSCs and elucidate the potential functions of the excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite.

    **Main Findings:** Our study generated 26,514 nonredundant sequences (unigenes), of which 22,910 (86.4%) were mapped to the newly published E. granulosus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were distributed within the coding sequence (CDS) regions. We predicted 2,280 ESPs, of which 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 intracellular enzymes regulating glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (GL/GN) pathways. Additionally, we identified 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and four proteases that were highly represented.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic adaptation of E. granulosus PSCs to their hosts, which can be used to aid the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control. The identification of ESPs involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolism, as well as GL/GN pathways, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

    **Conclusions:** This study contributes to our understanding of the genomics of E. granulosus and deepens our knowledge of host-parasite interactions. The transcriptome analysis of E. granulosus PSCs provides a comprehensive understanding of the parasite's metabolic adaptation mechanisms, which can inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment and control of cystic hydatid disease (CHD).

    **Title:** Nitrate-Dependent Regulation of NirA in Aspergillus nidulans: A Novel Mechanism of Post-Translational Modification

    **Research Question:** How does Aspergillus nidulans regulate the transcription factor NirA in response to nitrate availability?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, and subcellular localization studies to investigate the post-translational modification (PTM) of NirA in response to nitrate.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that in the absence of nitrate, NirA is predominantly cytosolic and transcriptionally inactive. However, in the presence of nitrate, NirA rapidly accumulates in the nucleus and becomes transcriptionally active. We identified a conserved methionine residue (Met169) in the nuclear export sequence (NES) of NirA that is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide (Metox169) in the absence of nitrate. This oxidation is dependent on the flavin-containing monooxygenase FmoB. In contrast, exposure to nitrate leads to the rapid reduction of Metox169 to Met169, which is independent of thioredoxin and classical methionine sulfoxide reductases.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the oxidation status of Met169 in the NES controls the subcellular distribution and transcriptional competence of NirA. We propose that in the presence of nitrate, the nitrate-responsive domain (NiRD) masks the NES, restricting active NirA molecules to the nucleus. In the absence of nitrate, Met169 oxidation leads to loss of protection by the NiRD, NES exposure, and relocation of the inactive NirA to the cytosol.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of nitrate-dependent regulation of NirA in Aspergillus nidulans, which may serve as a model for other nitrate-assimilating eukaryotes such as algae and plants. The identification of FmoB as a key regulator of NirA PTM provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrate signalling in fungi and has implications for our understanding of nitrogen metabolism in eukaryotes.

    **Title:** Functional Constraints Shape Evolution of Mammalian Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels

    **Research Question:** How do functional constraints bound and shape the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels?

    **Background:** Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the propagation of action potentials in mammalian cells. Mathematical models suggest that sodium channel properties must be tightly constrained for an action potential to propagate. However, the presence of nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, many of which are highly similar in sequence, raises questions about the functional diversity of these channels.

    **Methods:** We analyzed functional data on mammalian sodium channel properties collected from 172 different sets of measurements from 40 publications, including wild-type and mutant channels under various conditions. We compared the predicted constraints on sodium channel diversity with the functional data to determine the extent to which these constraints shape the evolution of sodium channels.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the simplest theoretical constraints bounding sodium channel diversity – the requirements of membrane excitability and the uniqueness of the resting potential – act directly on constraining sodium channel properties. The data from all channel types, including mutants, obey the excitability constraint, while channels expressed in muscle tend to obey the constraint of a unique resting potential, whereas channels expressed in neuronal tissue do not. The excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups that are consistent with phylogenetic analysis.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that functional constraints play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels. The multiplicity of genes encoding sodium channels can be explained by the presence of these constraints, which allow for functional diversity while maintaining the essential properties required for action potential propagation.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels and highlights the importance of functional constraints in shaping the diversity of these channels. The results have implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying action potential propagation and the evolution of mammalian nervous systems.

    **Title:** Structural Insights into Influenza Polymerase Endonuclease Inhibition: High-Resolution Crystal Structures of pH1N1 PA Endonuclease with Specific Inhibitors

    **Research Question:** Can high-resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) PA endonuclease domain with specific inhibitors provide valuable insights into the design of potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase?

    **Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the high-resolution structures of the pH1N1 PA endonuclease domain in complex with a series of specific inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin, all of which chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal the binding modes of the different compounds and a mononucleotide phosphate, highlighting the plasticity of certain structural elements of the active site cavity and the ability of distinct substituent groups on the basic metal binding scaffold to bind in distinct sub-pockets within the active site cavity. These findings provide valuable information for optimizing the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase.

    **Implications:** These results will significantly advance the goal of developing novel and efficacious influenza therapeutics that directly target viral replication. The unique and essential cap-snatching mechanism of transcription by influenza virus polymerase, and in particular, the endonuclease activity, has long been recognized as a good target for antiviral drug development. Our findings will guide modeling and medicinal chemistry approaches to optimize lead compounds for more efficient inhibition of PA endonuclease.

    **Conclusions:** Our high-resolution crystal structures of the pH1N1 PA endonuclease domain with specific inhibitors provide valuable insights into the design of potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase. These results will contribute to the development of novel and efficacious influenza therapeutics that directly target viral replication, addressing the need for new therapeutic options targeting influenza virus.
Title: Production of Potent Polyspecific Antisera against Medically Important Vipers of Thailand and Neighboring Countries using a Low Dose, Low Volume Multi-Site Immunization Protocol

    Abstract:
    Snake envenomation is a significant public health concern, affecting approximately 1.8 million people annually, with 94,000 deaths mainly in tropical countries. The development of effective, affordable, and sufficient antivenoms is crucial for treating these cases. This study aimed to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers of Thailand and its neighboring countries: Cryptelytrops albolabris (CA), Calloselasma rhodostoma (CR), and Daboia siamensis (DS). Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms using the ‘low dose, low volume multi-site’ immunization protocol. The antisera showed a rapid rise in ELISA titers against the three venoms, reaching a plateau at approximately the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency (P) of the antisera against CA, CR, and DS venoms was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively, which was significantly higher than the minimal potency limits set by the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI). The polyspecific antisera effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This study demonstrates the successful production of potent, truly polyspecific antisera against three vipers using the low dose, low volume multi-site immunization protocol. The commercial polyspecific antivenom in the form of F(ab’)2 has now been produced from the HP antisera by QSMI, which should help save the lives of many victims of envenomation by the three and other related vipers in many Southeast Asian countries.

    Research Question: Can a low dose, low volume multi-site immunization protocol be used to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers of Thailand and its neighboring countries?

    Methods: Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms using the ‘low dose, low volume multi-site’ immunization protocol.

    Main Findings: The antisera showed a rapid rise in ELISA titers against the three venoms, reaching a plateau at approximately the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency (P) of the antisera against CA, CR, and DS venoms was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively.

    Implications: The production of potent polyspecific antisera against three vipers using the low dose, low volume multi-site immunization protocol has significant implications for the treatment of snake envenomation in Southeast Asian countries.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the successful production of potent, truly polyspecific antisera against three vipers using the low dose, low volume multi-site immunization protocol. The commercial polyspecific antivenom in the form of F(ab’)2 has now been produced from the HP antisera by QSMI, which should help save the lives of many victims of envenomation by the three and other related vipers in many Southeast Asian countries.

    **Title:** Salmonella enterica effector protein SseI inhibits host cell migration to maintain chronic systemic infection

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the Salmonella enterica effector protein SseI in maintaining chronic systemic infection in mice?

    **Methods:** This study used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the function of SseI in Salmonella typhimurium infection. Mice were infected with wild-type (WT) S. typhimurium or a mutant strain lacking the sseI gene (ΔsseI). In vitro experiments were performed using primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) to assess the effects of SseI on cell migration.

    **Main Findings:** We found that SseI is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and DCs in vitro, and this inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1). SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of SseI is similar to PMT/ToxA, a bacterial toxin that contains a cysteine residue critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding residue in SseI (C178A) eliminates SseI function in vitro and in vivo, but not binding to IQGAP1. In vivo, infection with WT S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in an SseI-dependent manner, resulting in fewer DC and CD4+ T lymphocytes compared to mice infected with ΔsseI S. typhimurium.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which ultimately counteracts the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria. This mechanism allows Salmonella to persist systemically for long periods of time, making chronically infected hosts a critical reservoir for disease transmission.

    **Conclusions:** SseI is a key effector protein of Salmonella enterica that plays a crucial role in maintaining chronic systemic infection by inhibiting host cell migration. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Salmonella pathogenesis and highlight the importance of SseI as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

    **Title:** Mechanism of High Virulence in Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA)

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism for the high virulence of CA-MRSA compared to hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA)?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of the psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA, in suppressing the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. We analyzed 325 clinical MRSA isolates and found that 25% had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% had no psm-mec.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that psm-mec RNA specifically binds to agrA mRNA, encoding a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene, and inhibits its translation. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying intact psm-mec increased the expression of AgrA protein and PSMα, and virulence in mice. Furthermore, we found that one-third of HA-MRSA isolates from the Kanto area of Japan harbored a -7T>C mutated psm-mec or did not carry psm-mec, and these strains produced high amounts of PSMα.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the absence of psm-mec is a genetic determinant of the high virulence property of CA-MRSA, leading to increased expression of the agr locus. Identification of the psm-mec mutation could be a novel method for predicting the virulence properties of MRSA strains.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that psm-mec RNA suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agrA translation, and the absence of psm-mec in CA-MRSA causes its high virulence property. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the high virulence of CA-MRSA and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this socially problematic pathogen.

    **Title:** A Novel Mouse Model of Dengue Disease Enhancement Mediated by Maternal Antibodies in Immunocompetent Mice

    **Research Question:** Can a mouse model of dengue disease enhancement be replicated in a less immunocompromised background, and what are the implications for understanding dengue pathogenesis and evaluating vaccine and therapeutic candidates?

    **Methods:** We used type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice as a model to study dengue disease enhancement. Five-week-old A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers were infected with DENV2, and their disease severity was compared to mice born to naïve mothers.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers succumbed to a DENV2 infection within 4 days, which was sub-lethal in mice born to naïve mothers. Clinical manifestations included extensive hepatocyte vacuolation, moderate vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNFα therapy totally protected the mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome.

    **Implications:** Our novel mouse model of dengue disease enhancement mediated by maternal antibodies in A129 mice recapitulates a number of clinical manifestations observed in severe dengue patients, including increased vascular permeability, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, cytokine storm, and liver pathology. This model may help dissect the mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that a mouse model of dengue disease enhancement can be replicated in a less immunocompromised background, providing a valuable tool for understanding dengue pathogenesis and evaluating vaccine and therapeutic candidates. The A129 mouse model may also help investigate the protective or enhancing properties of vaccination-induced maternal antibodies in infants and the possible interference of maternal antibodies on vaccination efficacy in babies and young children.
Title: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Risk Factors for Visceral Leishmaniasis in Humans in the Americas

    Abstract:

    Background: Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum, has been urbanizing in the Americas for over 30 years, yet risk factors for its occurrence remain poorly understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify factors associated with L. infantum infection in humans in the Americas.

    Methods: A comprehensive search of databases, reference lists, and expert consultations yielded 51 studies for review. Theoretical discussions and meta-analysis of p-values and effect sizes were used to pool information on each variable. Heterogeneities among studies were assessed using the Q test and I2 statistic.

    Main Findings: Male sex was associated with visceral leishmaniasis in studies using the leishmanin skin test for diagnosis and clinical disease, but not with serological diagnosis. Younger individuals were less frequently infected than adults but more prone to illness. The presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were consistently associated with L. infantum infection. In contrast, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not associated with infection.

    Implications: These findings highlight the importance of dogs as a marker of visceral leishmaniasis occurrence among humans and suggest that control measures should target areas with high dog seropositivity. The results also underscore the need for improved methodological quality in future studies and the investigation of patterns identified in this review.

    Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the first comprehensive overview of risk factors for L. infantum infection in humans in the Americas. The findings emphasize the need for targeted control measures and highlight the importance of further research in new areas of the continent. Future studies should prioritize the investigation of patterns identified in this review and their causes, as well as variables for which knowledge is poor.

    **Title:** Innate Myeloid Cell Response Drives Host Mortality in Lethal Pulmonary Tularemia

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying acute pathogenesis and death in pulmonary tularemia caused by Francisella tularensis (Ft)?

    **Methods:** We investigated the sequential and systemic host immune response in pulmonary tularemia using a mouse model of lethal and sub-lethal infection with Ft SchuS4 and LVS strains.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that an overt innate cellular response to Ft, characterized by the recruitment of immature myeloid cells (IMC) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), drives tissue pathology and host mortality in lethal pulmonary tularemia. In contrast, sub-lethal infection with Ft LVS elicits a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, which are required for protection against Ft. We found that medullary and extra-medullary myelopoiesis supports the recruitment of large numbers of IMC and MDSC to the lungs, where these cells fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. The acceleration of this process may account for the rapid lethality seen with Ft SchuS4. Furthermore, eliciting a mature phagocyte response provides transient, but dramatic, innate protection against Ft SchuS4.

    **Conclusions:** This study defines critical parameters accompanying host death during pulmonary tularemia and identifies the inappropriate elaboration of IMC/MDSC as the Ft-driven cause of death. Our results suggest that differences in host mortality versus survival may be reflected not primarily by control of bacterial load, but by the nature of the innate myeloid cell response during the acute phase of infection. These findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat pulmonary tularemia.

    **Title:** Reconstructing the Colonization Pattern of the Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus): Implications for Arbovirus Transmission

    **Research Question:** What is the demographic history of Aedes albopictus populations in Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas, and how does it impact the transmission of arboviruses such as chikungunya (CHIKV), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV)?

    **Methods:** We combined classical population genetics analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches to infer the demographic history of Aedes albopictus populations from representative countries in Southeast Asia (China, Thailand, and Japan) and recently colonized areas (La Réunion, America, and the Mediterranean Basin).

    **Main Findings:** Our results indicate that Aedes albopictus populations in Southeast Asia maintain high genetic connectivity, revealing their ancestral common origin. China appears to be the oldest population. In contrast, the invasion process in recently colonized areas is primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution, resulting in high genetic diversity within adventive populations. Independent and trans-continental introductions of Ae. albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that both population ancestry and admixture contribute to creating conditions for efficient arbovirus transmission and outbreak establishment. The high genetic diversity within adventive populations may extend to the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence, increasing the risk of arbovirus transmission.

    **Conclusions:** Understanding the colonization pattern of Aedes albopictus is crucial for mitigating its spread and disease risks. Our study provides valuable information on the origins of populations from Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Basin, the Pacific Ocean islands, and North America. The outcomes of this research are essential for developing models that predict the risk of vector outbreaks and assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in old and newly invaded areas where Ae. albopictus has become established.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fitness in Chronic Wound Infections

    **Research Question:** What are the genes and functions that mediate the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wound infections, and what are the selective pressures that shape bacterial behavior in these environments?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of P. aeruginosa isolates from human chronic wounds, using a combination of genomic and phenotypic approaches to identify bacterial functions that contribute to fitness in murine chronic wounds.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to expectations, we found that clinical isolates from chronic human wounds were frequently defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation, and that many virulence and biofilm formation genes were not required for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity were critical for bacterial survival and growth in wounds. We also demonstrated that the fitness characteristics of some wound-impaired mutants could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane-stress conditions ex vivo, and more comprehensively by high-density bacterial growth conditions in the absence of a host.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the predominant stresses on bacteria in wounds may be applied by the bacteria themselves, rather than the host, and that overlapping functions may counteract both bacterial and host-applied stresses. These results also shed light on the role of biofilms in chronic infections, and suggest that chronic wounds may be relatively permissive environments in which bacterial nutrient acquisition and growth may not depend on invasive or toxic functions.

    **Conclusions:** This study advances our understanding of the P. aeruginosa functions needed to initiate and maintain chronic wound infections, and highlights the importance of anaerobic growth, metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity for bacterial fitness in wounds. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat P. aeruginosa infections in chronic wounds.

    Title: Complete Excision of Hydrocele Sac Reduces Hydrocele Recurrence in Bancroftian Filariasis Endemic Areas: A Prospective Study

    Background: Bancroftian filariasis is an endemic disease affecting 80 countries worldwide, with chronic hydrocele being its most common manifestation. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of complete excision of the hydrocele sac in reducing hydrocele recurrence in patients living in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area.

    Methods: A prospective study was conducted at the Center for Teaching, Research and Tertiary Referral for Bancroftian Filariasis (NEPAF). A total of 1,128 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele (Group-1) and 218 patients from the same area who had undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere (Comparison Group) were enrolled. Twenty-eight patients from the Comparison Group with hydrocele recurrence were re-operated on at NEPAF and constituted Group-2.

    Main Findings: The hydrocele recurrence rates in Group-1 and the Comparison Group were 0.3% and 19.3%, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no hydrocele recurrence in Group-2. Per-surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients in Group-1 and Group-2, respectively (p = 0.081). The testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients from Group-1 and Group-2, respectively (p = 0.025).

    Implications: Our findings suggest that complete excision of the hydrocele sac reduces hydrocele recurrence in patients living in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas. Lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is an important component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid that threatens the integrity of the testis in an adult population living in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas.

    Conclusions: To avoid hydrocele recurrence, we advise complete excision of the hydrocele sac and, when identified, leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels should be sutured or excised. Our study provides unprecedented detailed findings leading to a pioneering classification of recurrent hydrocele in endemic areas occurring after eversion technique with and without partial excision of the hydrocele sac. Lymphatic fistulae are likely to be an important mechanism responsible for chronic hydrocele, whether recurrent or not, in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas.
Title: Identification and Characterization of a Deubiquitinating Enzyme in Trichinella spiralis: Implications for Trichinellosis Treatment

    Abstract:
    Trichinella spiralis, a zoonotic parasitic nematode, causes trichinellosis, a disease prevalent on all continents except Antarctica. During chronic infection, T. spiralis larvae infect skeletal myofibres, disrupting their differentiation state. This study aimed to identify and characterize a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) in T. spiralis larvae. Using an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, we identified a number of potential DUBs in T. spiralis L1 larvae lysate. Immuno-blot and immuno-precipitation analysis revealed peptides with sequence homology to five conserved human DUBs, including UCH-L5, UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B, and Ataxin-3. We cloned and expressed the predicted gene encoding the putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37, and verified its deubiquitinating activity using the Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation experiments showed that TsUCH37 associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. Furthermore, the UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 specifically inhibited recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. This study reports the identification of the first T. spiralis DUB, a cysteine protease putatively orthologous to the human protein hUCH-L5. Our findings suggest that the interaction of this protein with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution, and that UCH enzymes may play a crucial role in T. spiralis infection. The use of inhibitor compounds, such as LDN-57444, may elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and provide a potential therapeutic target for trichinellosis treatment.

    Methods:
    We used an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, to identify DUB activity in T. spiralis L1 larvae lysate. Immuno-blot and immuno-precipitation analysis were used to identify peptides with sequence homology to conserved human DUBs. The predicted gene encoding the putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37, was cloned and expressed, and its deubiquitinating activity was verified using the Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation experiments were performed to investigate the interaction between TsUCH37 and putative T. spiralis proteasome components.

    Main Findings:
    We identified a number of potential DUBs in T. spiralis L1 larvae lysate, including UCH-L5, UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B, and Ataxin-3. We cloned and expressed the predicted gene encoding the putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37, and verified its deubiquitinating activity. Co-precipitation experiments showed that TsUCH37 associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including ADRM1. The UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 specifically inhibited recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that UCH enzymes may play a crucial role in T. spiralis infection. The use of inhibitor compounds, such as LDN-57444, may elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and provide a potential therapeutic target for trichinellosis treatment.

    Conclusions:
    This study reports the identification of the first T. spiralis DUB, a cysteine protease putatively orthologous to the human
Title: Identification of Nitrile-Based Cysteine Protease Inhibitors with Potent Anti-Trypanosomal Activity against T. cruzi

    Abstract:

    Background: Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in the Americas. Cysteine protease cruzipain is a validated target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of Chagas disease. We investigated the anti-trypanosomal activity of nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors against the CL Brener strain of T. cruzi.

    Methods: We synthesized and evaluated the anti-trypanosomal activity of three nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors based on two scaffolds associated with cathepsin K inhibition. Enzyme inhibition assays were performed against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain, to determine Ki values.

    Main Findings: Three nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors showed anti-trypanosomal activity against T. cruzi in the 0.1 μM to 1 μM range. Two compounds, with EC50 values of 0.12 μM and 0.25 μM, exhibited potent anti-trypanosomal activity, which was an order of magnitude lower than their corresponding Ki values against cruzain. This suggests a putative polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases.

    Implications: Our findings indicate that the anti-trypanosomal activity of these compounds may not be solely explained by cruzain inhibition, suggesting that other cysteine proteases, such as cruzipain-2, may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The cysteine protease inhibition profile suggests that a new antichagasic target may share molecular recognition characteristics with cathepsin K.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential of nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors as anti-trypanosomal agents against T. cruzi. The observed polypharmacological profile of the most potent compounds suggests that targeting multiple cysteine proteases may be a viable strategy for the treatment of Chagas disease. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-trypanosomal activity of these compounds and to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.

    Title: Unraveling the Maize Genome: A Sequence-Ready Fingerprinted Contig-Based Physical Map Reveals Insights into Genome Organization and Evolution

    Background: Maize (Zea mays L.) is a crucial cereal crop and a model organism for studying genetics, evolution, and domestication. To better understand maize genome organization and facilitate genome sequencing, we constructed a sequence-ready fingerprinted contig-based physical map covering 93.5% of the genome.

    Research Question: What is the organization of the maize genome, and how has it evolved over time?

    Methods: We developed a fingerprinted contig map containing 25,908 genic markers, which enabled us to align nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. We also employed comparative restricted fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping across cereals to support our findings.

    Main Findings: Our analysis revealed that maize has a 6-fold genome size expansion compared to rice, which can be attributed to the recent polyploid origin of maize. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during subsequent maize diploidization. We also found evidence of ancient genome duplication predating the divergence of maize and rice progenitors. Reconstruction of the paleoethnobotany of the maize genome indicates that the progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into maize genome organization and evolution, shedding light on the organization of the chromosomes of the progenitors contributing to maize polyploidization and unraveling rearrangements associated with the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome.

    Conclusions: This study presents a comprehensive sequence-ready fingerprinted contig-based physical map of the maize genome, covering 93.5% of the genome. The alignment of the maize and rice genomes reveals a complex pattern of genome evolution, including recent polyploidization, inversions, and ancient genome duplication. Our results have significant implications for understanding maize genome organization, evolution, and domestication, and provide a framework for future genome sequencing efforts.

    **Title:** De Novo Generation of Infectious Prions in Vitro: Implications for the Etiology of Sporadic Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies

    **Background:** Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by prions, proteinaceous infectious agents that replicate in the absence of nucleic acids. The prion hypothesis proposes that prions are composed of a misfolded version of the prion protein (PrPSc) that induces the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC).

    **Research Question:** Can de novo generation of infectious PrPSc be achieved in vitro using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) procedure, and what are the implications for the etiology of sporadic TSEs?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the possibility of spontaneous generation of PrPSc by PMCA in brain homogenates from different animal species, under standard and modified conditions.

    **Main Findings:** Under standard PMCA conditions, de novo generation of PrPSc was not observed, supporting the use of the technology for diagnostic applications. However, we report that PMCA can be modified to generate PrPSc in the absence of pre-existing PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. The de novo generated PrPSc was infectious when inoculated into wild-type hamsters, producing a new disease phenotype with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features.

    **Implications:** Our results provide additional evidence in support of the prion hypothesis and offer a simple model to study the mechanism of sporadic prion disease. The findings also suggest that prion diversity is not restricted to those currently known, and that new forms of infectious protein foldings may be produced, resulting in novel disease phenotypes.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that de novo generation of infectious PrPSc can be achieved in vitro using modified PMCA conditions, providing new insights into the etiology of sporadic TSEs. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of prion biology and may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for prion diseases.

    **Title:** A Neurally Based Model for Estimating Angular Velocity in Honeybees: Implications for Visual Odometry and Corridor-Centering Behavior

    **Research Question:** Can a novel neurally based model, the Angular Velocity Detector Unit (AVDU), quantitatively reproduce experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering behavior in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted for manipulations of behavior?

    **Methods:** The AVDU model was fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioral data from honeybees navigating a corridor with gratings on the walls. The model was also tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the AVDU model reproduces several behavioral patterns, including the deviation of the average flight path from the corridor center according to differences in spatial frequency of sinusoidal gratings on opposite walls, and the deviations of the average flight path from the corridor center for square wave and sinusoidal gratings. Additionally, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response, allowing different detectors to be constructed by drawing selectively from a pool of elementary motion detectors with varying response timescales. The AVDU model provides a novel explanation for the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behavior.

    **Conclusions:** The AVDU model provides a neurally based explanation for the angular velocity response in honeybees, which can be used to estimate distance by summing the detector output over time and over all parts of the visual field. Our results have implications for understanding the neural basis of visual odometry and corridor-centering behavior in honeybees, and provide a framework for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying insect navigation.

    **Title:** Alternative Progressions of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT): Evidence of Trypanotolerance in Humans

    **Background:** Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, has long been considered a invariably fatal disease. However, anecdotal reports of self-cure in untreated patients have been documented, but their validity was compromised by the lack of accurate diagnostic tools at the time.

    **Research Question:** Do alternative natural progressions of HAT exist, and if so, what are their characteristics?

    **Methods:** We conducted a 15-year follow-up study on a cohort of 50 HAT patients from the Ivory Coast, among whom 11 refused treatment after initial diagnosis. We used a combination of clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations, including microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serological tests.

    **Main Findings:** In 10 out of 11 patients who continued to refuse treatment, parasite clearance was observed using both microscopy and PCR. Most of these patients (7/10) also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens (LiTat 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6). Furthermore, we observed two alternative natural progressions of HAT: (1) an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and (2) an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection with negative results in parasitological tests and PCR, associated with a progressive drop in antibody titres.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that trypanotolerance exists in humans, as is now widely accepted for animals. This has significant implications for future research in the field of HAT, as it challenges the conventional view of the disease as invariably fatal.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides the most comprehensive evidence to date on the natural evolution of T. brucei gambiense infection in its human host. We demonstrate that alternative natural progressions of HAT exist, and that trypanotolerance is a reality in humans. These findings have important implications for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HAT, and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying trypanotolerance in humans.

    **Title:** Ionizing Irradiation Selects for p53-Deficient Hematopoietic Progenitors and Contributes to Lymphoid Malignancies

    **Research Question:** Does ionizing irradiation select for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in vivo, and does this selection contribute to the development of lymphoid malignancies?

    **Methods:** We used mouse models to investigate the effects of ionizing irradiation on hematopoietic progenitors with and without p53 disruption. We analyzed the selective advantage of p53-deficient cells in an unstressed hematopoietic system and in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover from irradiation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that p53 disruption does not provide a clear selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover from irradiation. However, upon irradiation, p53 disruption confers a dramatic selective advantage, leading to long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. This selection is attributed to several factors, including protection from acute irradiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the disabling/elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing irradiation can in part be explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells both from immediate elimination and from long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation.

    **Conclusions:** Contrary to the predominant role of mutagenesis, our results demonstrate that irradiation strongly selects for p53-deficient cells in pools of stem and progenitor cells and that this selection does not rely on acquisition of additional oncogenic mutations. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the carcinogenic effects of ionizing irradiation and highlight the importance of selection in the development of lymphoid malignancies.
Title: Serine Protease Inhibitor SmKI-1 from Schistosoma mansoni Plays a Crucial Role in Parasite Development and Modulates Inflammatory Diseases

    Abstract:
    Background: Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm, utilizes serine protease inhibitors to evade host immune responses and facilitate its survival. We investigated the role of SmKI-1, a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor from S. mansoni, in parasite development and its potential as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases.

    Methods: Recombinant SmKI-1 and its Kunitz domain were expressed and characterized for their inhibitory activity against trypsin and neutrophil elastase (NE). Molecular docking studies were conducted to elucidate the molecular basis of NE inhibition by SmKI-1. Additionally, specific siRNA was designed to knockdown SmKI-1 in S. mansoni, and its impact on parasite development was assessed in vitro and in vivo. The anti-inflammatory potential of SmKI-1 was evaluated in murine models of inflammatory diseases, including acetaminophen-mediated liver damage, gout arthritis, and carrageenan-induced pleural inflammation.

    Main Findings: SmKI-1 exhibited inhibitory activity against trypsin and NE, with the Kunitz domain being responsible for this activity. Molecular docking studies revealed a complete blockage of the NE active site by SmKI-1. Knockdown of SmKI-1 in S. mansoni significantly impaired parasite development in vitro and in vivo. SmKI-1 treatment rescued acetaminophen-mediated liver damage by reducing neutrophil recruitment and elastase activity. In the gout arthritis model, SmKI-1 reduced neutrophil accumulation, IL-1β secretion, hypernociception, and overall pathological score. Furthermore, SmKI-1 inhibited early events that trigger neutrophil recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response to carrageenan.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that SmKI-1 plays a crucial role in S. mansoni survival and has the potential to inhibit neutrophil function, making it a promising therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases. The ability of SmKI-1 to interact with elastase's catalytic site and inhibit enzyme activity could be a potential immune evasion mechanism developed by the parasite.

    Conclusions: SmKI-1 is a key protein in S. mansoni survival, and its expression is essential for parasite development. Our study highlights the potential of SmKI-1 as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases, including liver damage, gout arthritis, and pleural inflammation. Further research is warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of SmKI-1 in humans.
Title: Accurate Modeling of Eukaryotic Transmembrane Helical Proteins from Distant Homologues: A Novel Method for High-Resolution Structure Prediction

    Abstract:
    The structural characterization of eukaryotic transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins remains a significant challenge due to the lack of close structural homologues. To address this issue, we developed a novel and generic method for accurately modeling large TMH protein structures from distant homologues exhibiting distinct loop and TMH conformations. Our approach was validated in two blind predictions and a large benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity. The method improved most starting templates and achieved near-atomic accuracy prediction of membrane-embedded regions. Notably, the models were of suitable quality for computer-based protein engineering, with redesigned models and X-ray structures exhibiting very similar native interactions. This method should prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues.

    Research Question:
    Can a novel method accurately model large TMH protein structures from distant homologues exhibiting distinct loop and TMH conformations?

    Methods:
    We developed a novel method for accurately modeling large TMH protein structures from distant homologues. The method was validated in two blind predictions (GPCR-DOCK 2008 and GPCR-DOCK 2010) and a large benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity.

    Main Findings:
    Our method improved most starting templates and achieved near-atomic accuracy prediction of membrane-embedded regions. The models were of suitable quality for computer-based protein engineering, with redesigned models and X-ray structures exhibiting very similar native interactions.

    Implications:
    This method should prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues. The high-resolution prediction of membrane protein structures is essential for the design of more effective therapeutics and receptors with novel function for systems/synthetic biology applications.

    Conclusions:
    Our novel method provides a significant advancement in the structural characterization of eukaryotic TMH proteins. By accurately modeling large TMH protein structures from distant homologues, this method should facilitate the design of more effective therapeutics and receptors with novel function, ultimately contributing to the development of new treatments and applications in systems/synthetic biology.

    **Title:** Listeria monocytogenes Enters a Persistent State in Vacuoles during Infection of Human Hepatocytes and Trophoblast Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the intracellular lifecycle of Listeria monocytogenes during prolonged infection of human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells?

    **Methods:** We developed a new experimental protocol to study L. monocytogenes during prolonged infections of non-phagocytic human cells. We infected human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells with L. monocytogenes and observed the bacteria's behavior over several days.

    **Main Findings:** We found that L. monocytogenes switches from an active, motile lifestyle to a persistent state in vacuoles after several days of infection. During this transition, the bacteria cease to produce the actin-nucleating protein ActA and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles termed Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs). Subpopulations of bacteria resisted degradation in LisCVs and entered a slow/non-replicative state. We also observed that bacteria in LisCVs can cycle between the vacuolar and actin-based motility stages.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that L. monocytogenes can enter a persistent state in a subset of epithelial cells, which may favor the asymptomatic carriage of this pathogen, lengthen the incubation period of listeriosis, and promote bacterial survival during antibiotic therapy.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a new aspect of the intracellular lifecycle of L. monocytogenes, which challenges the traditional view of this bacterium as a cytosolic pathogen. The ability of L. monocytogenes to enter a persistent state in vacuoles may have significant implications for our understanding of listeriosis and the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat this disease. Our findings also highlight the importance of studying L. monocytogenes in human cells, as the murine model of listeriosis may not be optimal for investigating the persistence of this bacterium in epithelial tissues.

    **Title:** A Neuromechanistic Model of Auditory Streaming: Exploring the Dynamics of Perceptual Alternations

    **Research Question:** What are the neural mechanisms underlying the persistent alternations between integrated and segregated percepts in auditory streaming, and how do stimulus parameters influence these alternations?

    **Methods:** We developed a neuromechanistic model of auditory streaming that incorporates neuronal units with sensory feature-dependent inputs, mimicking the pulsatile-like A1 responses to tones in the ABA-triplet pattern. The model includes mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise, as well as slow NMDA recurrent excitation for local temporal memory. Percepts are identified in the firing patterns of the neuronal units.

    **Main Findings:** Our model predicts that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. We confirmed this qualitative prediction with psychoacoustic experiments and used the behavioral data to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results.

    **Implications:** Our work provides a platform for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying auditory streaming and the effects of stimulus parameters on perceptual alternations. The model can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition.

    **Conclusions:** Our neuromechanistic model of auditory streaming offers a novel approach to understanding the dynamics of perceptual alternations after the build-up phase. By incorporating sound-evoked A1 responses and NMDA-like synaptic dynamics, our model provides a more accurate representation of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory streaming. The model's ability to predict the effects of stimulus parameters on perceptual alternations highlights the importance of dynamic inputs that depend on perceptual state. Future work will focus on exploring the neural mechanisms underlying attention effects in auditory streaming.
Title: Genome-Wide Characterization of Schistosoma mansoni Allergens Using a Cell-Free In Vitro Translation System and a Humanized Basophil Reporter Cell Line

    Abstract:

    Background: Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) is a parasitic flatworm that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Parasite-specific IgE is thought to correlate with protection against S. mansoni infection or re-infection. However, the molecular targets of the IgE response in S. mansoni infection remain poorly characterized.

    Research Question: Can a genome-wide characterization of S. mansoni allergens be achieved using a cell-free in vitro translation system and a humanized basophil reporter cell line?

    Methods: We developed a medium- to high-throughput amenable workflow that enables the rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins using wheat germ lysate and subsequent assessment of potential allergenicity with a humanized Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) reporter cell line. Cell-free translation was completed within 90 minutes, generating sufficient amounts of parasitic protein for rapid screening of allergenicity without any need for purification. Antigenic integrity was demonstrated using Western Blotting.

    Main Findings: We demonstrated the suitability of this system for characterization of novel S. mansoni allergens using well-characterized plant and parasitic allergens such as Par j 2, SmTAL-1, and the IgE binding factor IPSE/alpha-1. SmTAL-1, but not SmTAL2 (used as a negative control), was able to activate the basophil reporter cell line. This method offers an accessible way for assessment of potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates and is suitable for medium- to high-throughput studies using infected individual sera.

    Implications: This technology paves the way for high-throughput, genome-wide assessment of S. mansoni antigen allergenicity - the Schistosoma allergome. When used at the whole genome level, it could be used to unravel the entire allergome of S. mansoni and other medically important parasites. Ultimately, this could lead to a better understanding of the basis of allergenicity, and in combination with additional cellular studies, to a better understanding of the relationship between parasite-specific IgE and host protection mechanisms at the molecular level.

    Conclusions: We demonstrate proof-of-principle of how the RS-ATL8 cell line, in combination with a cell-free in vitro translation system and a set of stringent quality controls, can be used for assessment of allergenicity of S. mansoni antigens. This method offers a robust way for assessing potential allergenicity of S. mansoni (or any other parasite) in a format suitable for high-throughput analysis.

    **Title:** Divergence in Transposable Element (TE) Landscape Contributes to Hybrid Dysgenesis and Transgenerational Effects on Gene Expression in Drosophila

    **Research Question:** How does divergence in the TE landscape between parents contribute to hybrid dysgenesis and transgenerational effects on gene expression in Drosophila?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of divergence in TE profile between parents on offspring using the D. virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model. We analyzed TE and piRNA expression in 0-2 hour old embryos laid by F1 females from non-dysgenic crosses and F1 escaper females of the dysgenic cross.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses. These differences are transmitted to the next generation, and chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise through polymorphic TE insertions.

    **Implications:** Our findings support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. This work demonstrates that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying hybrid dysgenesis and transgenerational effects on gene expression in Drosophila. The results suggest that divergence in the TE landscape between parents can lead to chronic and persisting TE expression, which is associated with reduced gene expression and increased levels of genic piRNAs. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of TEs in genome evolution and the mechanisms of host genome defense by small RNAs.

    **Title:** Histone Deacetylases and Chromatin Remodeling in Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS)

    **Background:** Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5′UTR of the fragile X syndrome (FXS) gene, FMR1. Despite the critical role of FMR1 mRNA in disease pathogenesis, the basis for the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression is unknown.

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression in FXTAS?

    **Methods:** We used a Drosophila model of FXTAS to investigate the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in suppressing CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration. We also evaluated the acetylation state of histones at the human FMR1 locus in patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts.

    **Main Findings:** Overexpression of HDACs 3, 6, or 11 suppressed CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila, resulting from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat-containing transgene. We found increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS-derived cell lines, which correlates with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repressed FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extended lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila.

    **Implications:** Our findings support a disease model in which the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in cis, leading to increased expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. These results provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression in FXTAS, involving chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation. These findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for FXTAS, including the use of HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.

    **Title:** MHC Heterogeneity and Host Genetics Influence CD8 T Cell Exhaustion and Viral Clearance during Chronic Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) Infection

    **Research Question:** What is the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection, and how do these factors influence CD8 T cell exhaustion and viral clearance?

    **Methods:** F1 crosses of B10.D2 x B6 (D2B6F1) and BALB.B x BALB/c (BCF1) mice were infected with the clone-13 (Cl-13) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). CD8 T cell depletion was performed to assess the role of CD8 T cells in mortality and viral control.

    **Main Findings:** Both D2B6F1 and BCF1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice following chronic Cl-13 infection. Strikingly, H-2bxd D2B6F1 mice on a C57BL genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection, which was CD8 T-cell-dependent. D2B6F1 mice maintained more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production and exhibited reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1. Additionally, D2B6F1 mice induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice, and Cl-13-induced mortality in D2B6F1 mice was dependent on CD4 T-cell-mediated IFN-γ production.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that increasing MHC heterogeneity results in an increase in the frequency of responding CD8 T cells during a chronic viral infection, leading to more rapid viral clearance at the cost of enhanced immunopathology dependent on both MHC diversity and the genetic background of the host. Understanding the mechanisms that induce an effective CD8 T cell response to prevent viral persistence without the induction of immunopathology is vital to the prevention of chronic infection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that both MHC heterogeneity and host genetic background significantly impact CD8 T cell exhaustion and viral clearance during chronic LCMV Cl-13 infection. These findings have important implications for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent chronic viral infections.

    **Title:** Genetic Diversity and Geographical Distribution of Bacillus anthracis in Northwestern China: A Decade of Outbreaks

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic characteristics and geographical distribution of Bacillus anthracis strains isolated from human anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China over the past decade?

    **Methods:** We conducted a retrospective epidemiological and molecular study using canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers to analyze 106 B. anthracis strains collected from six provinces in northwestern China between 1990 and 2016.

    **Main Findings:** Five sublineages/subgroups (A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Vollum, A. Br. Aust94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009) were detected using 13 canSNP sites, with all sublineages found in Xinjiang province. The geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations exhibited different canSNP characteristics from those of strains isolated before 1990 in China. The A. Br. Ames subgroup was also observed to be scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces. MLVA analysis revealed 36 genotypes, with 21 of these types first observed in this study. The strains collected from anthrax outbreaks in the recent decade were classified as subgroups A. Br. 001/002 and A. Br. Ames and identified as genotypes MLVA15-28, MLVA15-30, MLVA15-31, MLVA15-38, MLVA15-CHN3, and MLVA15-CHN18.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the diversification of MLVA genotypes and the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations is gradually becoming balanced across northwestern China. This study provides preliminary survey results regarding the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which will help promote the prevention and control of this important disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the genetic diversity and geographical distribution of B. anthracis in northwestern China over the past decade. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of anthrax in China and inform strategies for disease prevention and control.

    **Title:** Goblet Cell-Derived Resistin-Like Molecule-β (RELM-β) Recruits CD4+ T Cells to Protect Against Enteric Pathogens

    **Research Question:** What is the role of goblet cell-derived Resistin-Like Molecule-β (RELM-β) in host defense against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and related food and waterborne pathogens?

    **Methods:** Wildtype and RELM-β gene deficient (Retnlb-/-) mice were orally infected with Citrobacter rodentium, a related mouse pathogen. Mice were monitored for C. rodentium burdens, mortality, and mucosal pathology. Immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to assess goblet cell proliferation, CD4+ T cell recruitment, and cytokine production.

    **Main Findings:** Despite similar C. rodentium burdens, Retnlb-/- mice suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. Immunostaining revealed that Retnlb-/- mice were significantly impaired in infection-induced intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) hyper-proliferation. RELM-β acted as a CD4+ T cell chemoattractant, and its absence resulted in impaired CD4+ T cell recruitment to the infected colon. Enema delivery of RELM-β to Retnlb-/- mice restored CD4+ T cell recruitment, increased IEC proliferation, and reduced mucosal pathology.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that RELM-β and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon to protect against enteric pathogens. RELM-β acts as a chemoattractant for CD4+ T cells, which drive a protective increase in IEC proliferation through the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22).

    **Conclusions:** Our study expands the role attributed to goblet cells in providing host defense against enteric bacteria and highlights the importance of RELM-β in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of host defense against enteric pathogens and suggest that RELM-β may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections.

    Title: Structural and Functional Insights into the Interaction between Norovirus VPg and Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4G (eIF4G)

    Background: Noroviruses are a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, and their positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome relies on an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis. The viral protein VPg, covalently attached to the 5´-end of the viral RNA, interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the host cell to facilitate translation initiation.

    Research Question: What are the structural and functional details of the interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G, a crucial component of the translation initiation machinery?

    Methods: We employed a combination of biochemical and biophysical assays, including pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, to investigate the interaction between murine norovirus (MNV) VPg and the middle fragment of eIF4G (4GM).

    Main Findings: We identified a conserved ~20 amino acid motif in the C terminus of MNV VPg that mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. NMR spectroscopy revealed that the VPg binding site on eIF4G HEAT-1 is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A. Furthermore, we demonstrated that norovirus VPg can form ternary VPg-eIF4G-eIF4A complexes.

    Implications: Our findings provide structural and functional insights into the interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G, revealing a conserved binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy. The ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA highlights the functional significance of this interaction.

    Conclusions: Our study defines the structural details of a functional interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying norovirus translation initiation. These findings have important implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting this critical step in the norovirus replication cycle.

    **Title:** Computational Modeling of Gene Cluster Evolution: A Re-examination of the Selfish Operon Model

    **Research Question:** What are the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist in bacterial populations, and can the selfish operon model explain the origins and maintenance of these clusters?

    **Methods:** We developed computational models to study the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial populations using a Moran process and genome inversion events. We re-implemented the selfish operon model and explored its parameter space to determine the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve. We also introduced a new model that combines natural selection and genome inversion to study the evolution of gene clusters.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions, including those previously proposed by Lawrence and Roth [10]. However, we found that certain conditions can promote the evolution of gene clusters, including a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and a high horizontal transfer rate in the case of the selfish operon model. We also found that the selfish operon model is still viable as an explanation for the evolution of gene clusters under these conditions.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the evolution of gene clusters is a complex process that depends on various factors, including the number of genes in the pathway, population size, and horizontal transfer rates. The selfish operon model remains a plausible explanation for the evolution of gene clusters, but it is not the only possible explanation. Our results also highlight the importance of considering multiple mechanisms, including horizontal transfer of selfish operons, in explaining the origins and maintenance of gene clusters.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational analysis provides new insights into the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial populations. While the selfish operon model is still a viable explanation for the evolution of gene clusters, our results suggest that other mechanisms, such as natural selection and genome inversion, may also play a role. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex processes underlying the evolution of gene clusters.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of VAR2CSA Expression in Plasmodium falciparum: A Novel Form of Gene Regulation in Malaria Parasites

    **Background:** Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is a significant public health concern in tropical regions, with pregnant women being particularly vulnerable to severe consequences due to the specific adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1, called VAR2CSA, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placentas.

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism of regulation of VAR2CSA expression in Plasmodium falciparum, and how does it contribute to the pathogenesis of pregnancy-associated malaria?

    **Methods:** We used cultured parasite lines and reporter gene constructs to investigate the regulation of VAR2CSA expression. Our results show that the gene encoding VAR2CSA contains a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites.

    **Main Findings:** Our study demonstrates that the uORF found upstream of the PfEMP1 coding region is not spliced out and is present in the mRNA, indicating that VAR2CSA is encoded by a bicistronic transcript. This suggests that an additional level of regulation controls expression of the PfEMP1 variant associated with pregnancy-associated malaria, potentially to prevent its expression at times when no placenta is available for binding.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular basis of the host-parasite interactions that underlie the pathogenesis of malaria. Further studies into the mechanisms used by malaria parasites to regulate VAR2CSA expression, as well as protein expression in general, will provide greater insights into the molecular basis of the disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites, where the uORF in the var2csa gene acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Dengue Virus Infection: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Peripheral Blood Immune Cells

    **Research Question:** What are the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells in patients with different manifestations of dengue virus (DENV) infection, and how do these profiles relate to the pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe disease outcomes?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua, collected on days 3-6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups.

    **Main Findings:** The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, particularly in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, a subset of differentially expressed genes encoded neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis of our dataset with previously published datasets confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection, as well as identify some commonalities. The data suggest that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3-6 of illness. The compilation of larger datasets across multiple studies may lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DENV infection and its pathophysiology. The identification of differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with severe versus non-severe disease outcomes may inform the development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for DENV infection. Further research is needed to validate these findings and to explore the potential of a systems biology approach for predicting disease manifestation in DENV-infected patients.

    **Title:** Heparan Sulfate-Dependent Host Entry of Murid Herpesvirus-4 in the Olfactory Neuroepithelium: Implications for Herpesvirus Infection Control

    **Research Question:** How do herpesviruses, such as Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), cross differentiated mucus-covered epithelia in vivo, specifically targeting the olfactory neuroepithelium for host entry?

    **Methods:** We used MuHV-4, a lymphotropic rhadinovirus related to Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus, as a tractable model to investigate the relationship between host heparan sulfate (HS) expression, virion binding, and infection in the olfactory neuroepithelium.

    **Main Findings:** We found that MuHV-4 virions targeted the olfactory neuroepithelium, where they bound to HS on the apical neuronal cilia and infected neurons or adjacent glial (sustentacular) cells. In contrast, the respiratory epithelium, which expressed only basolateral HS, was bound poorly by incoming virions. MuHV-4 exploited neurons for host entry, even though it is not classically neurotropic, suggesting that the olfactory neuroepithelium may provide an important entry portal for many herpesviruses.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that neuroepithelial-targeted, HS-based interventions could provide a general means of herpesvirus infection control. Furthermore, the exploitation of HS by MuHV-4 for host entry implies that factors besides HS availability may also restrict MuHV-4 host entry to the olfactory neuroepithelium.

    **Conclusions:** This study establishes the in vivo relationship between host HS expression, virion binding, and infection in the olfactory neuroepithelium. Our results highlight the importance of the olfactory neuroepithelium as a site of HS-dependent herpesvirus uptake and provide new insights into the mechanisms of herpesvirus host entry. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to control herpesvirus infections.

    **Title:** CRP-cAMP Regulates Salmonella Invasion by Silencing SPI-1 Genes through Post-Transcriptional Control of HilD

    **Research Question:** How does CRP-cAMP regulate the expression of SPI-1 genes, which are essential for Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells, under non-permissive conditions?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of CRP-cAMP in regulating SPI-1 gene expression in Salmonella enterica using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, including CRP-cAMP-deficient strains, genetic analyses, and in vivo and in vitro assays.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a novel regulatory circuit involving CRP-cAMP, a widely established metabolic regulator, in silencing SPI-1 genes under non-permissive conditions. CRP-cAMP modulates the level of HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcriptional level through a newly identified regulatory motif within the hilD 3’UTR. Furthermore, we found that the Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42 is under the transcriptional repression of CRP-cAMP and, when this repression is relieved, Spot 42 exerts a positive effect on hilD expression. In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that Spot 42 targets the 3’UTR of the hilD transcript through its unstructured region III.

    **Implications:** Our results highlight the biological relevance of the hilD 3’UTR as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression. The CRP-cAMP-mediated regulation of SPI-1 genes is essential for Salmonella virulence, as CRP-cAMP-deficient strains are unable to secrete SPI-1 T3SS effector proteins and are avirulent in a mouse model.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which CRP-cAMP regulates Salmonella invasion by silencing SPI-1 genes through post-transcriptional control of HilD. The CRP-cAMP-mediated regulation of hilD does not occur at the transcriptional initiation level but rather at the post-transcriptional level through the long 3’UTR of hilD. This study provides new insights into the complex regulatory networks controlling Salmonella virulence and highlights the importance of CRP-cAMP in mediating rapid responses to environmental changes during the infection process.

    **Title:** Transcription-Dependent Regulation of Somatic CAG Instability in Huntington’s Disease

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the Huntington’s disease (HD) locus in vivo?

    **Methods:** We investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using the R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene, albeit integrated at a different site, and recapitulate HD tissue-specific instability.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that instability rates are increased in R6/2 tissues compared to R6/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9 dimethylation was reduced in R6/2 tissues relative to R6/1 matched-tissues. Notably, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form of RNA Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum.

    **Implications:** Our data support the view that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo. Specifically, our results suggest that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying somatic CAG instability in Huntington’s disease. Our findings suggest that the integration site of the transgene influences repeat instability, affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we show that transcription elongation, rather than transcription initiation, is a key regulator of CAG instability in vivo. These results have important implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HD and may inform the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or slow disease progression.

    **Title:** Identification of Molecular Features Enhancing Enterovirus 71 Dissemination in Humans

    **Research Question:** What specific molecular features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) contribute to its ability to disseminate in humans, particularly in immunocompromised hosts?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the genomic features of EV71 in an immunocompromised host with disseminated disease, comparing five full-length genomes sequenced directly from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and blood specimens. We identified three nucleotide changes that occurred within a five-day period: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 (L97R) within the BC loop, a conservative amino acid substitution in protein 2B (A38V), and a silent mutation in protein 3D (L175). Infectious clones were constructed using both BrCr (lineage A) and the clinical strain (lineage C) backgrounds containing either one or both non-synonymous mutations.

    **Main Findings:** In vitro cell tropism and competition assays revealed that the VP1 L97R substitution within the BC loop conferred a replicative advantage in SH-SY5Y cells of neuroblastoma origin. This mutation was frequently associated with a second non-conservative mutation (E167G or E167A) in the VP1 EF loop in neuroblastoma cells. Comparative models of these EV71 VP1 variants suggested that the substitutions may alter interactions with host cell receptors, although no significant structural changes were observed.

    **Implications:** Our results indicate that the VP1 BC loop region of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism independent of EV71 lineage, which may have contributed to dissemination and neurotropism in the immunocompromised patient.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular features of EV71 that enhance its ability to disseminate in humans, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. The identification of the VP1 BC loop region as a critical determinant of cell tropism highlights the importance of this region in EV71 pathogenesis. These findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of EV71 infection and may inform the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat EV71-related diseases.

    Title: Elucidating Species-Specific Communication in Streptococcus through ComRS Quorum Sensing

    Research Question: How do Streptococcus species communicate through the ComRS quorum sensing system, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying species-specific recognition of pheromone molecules?

    Methods: We employed an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the ComRS system in Streptococcus species. We developed a ‘test-bed’ assay to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo. We also solved an X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis to understand the interaction with XIP and identify structural features that may explain XIP recognition.

    Main Findings: Our results revealed distinct ComR classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. We identified a variable and conserved face in the XIP-binding pocket of ComR, where residues of the conserved face contribute to ligand binding and the variable face discriminates among XIP peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical assays confirmed the importance of these residues in XIP recognition.

    Implications: Our findings provide a detailed structural and biochemical model for XIP recognition and specificity, allowing for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity. This knowledge has significant implications for understanding the role of ComRS in species-cross communication in the regulation of natural competence, particularly in pathogenic and commensal Streptococcus species.

    Conclusions: Our study provides a foundation for further research on the ComRS system in Streptococcus species and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying species-specific recognition of pheromone molecules. The development of an in vivo technology to test and monitor Streptococcus spp. communication in the regulation of competence has the potential to reveal the role of ComRS in a myriad of Streptococcus species, including those of industrial and medical importance.

    Title: Epigenetic Inheritance of Centromere Position through DNA Replication Timing in Candida albicans

    Research Question: How do centromeres maintain their specific chromosomal sites over many generations in eukaryotes, particularly in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans?

    Methods: We used Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. We determined the genome-wide replication timing program of the C. albicans genome and found that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome.

    Main Findings: We discovered that epigenetic formation of new ectopic centromeres (neocentromeres) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, such that a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components. Furthermore, changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions. Analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position. This mechanism is conserved among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence.

    Conclusions: We propose a model in which the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position. Our results provide evidence that DNA replication timing can serve as the basis for the inheritance of functional centromeres at specific chromosomal sites, representing a novel mechanism of epigenetic inheritance. This study highlights the importance of DNA replication timing in the maintenance of centromere position and provides new insights into the epigenetic regulation of centromeres in eukaryotes.

    Title: Genome-Wide Association Study Meta-Analysis Identifies Novel Genetic Loci Associated with Chronic Back Pain

    Background: Chronic back pain (CBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, yet the underlying biology remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to identify genetic variants associated with CBP in adults of European ancestry.

    Methods: We pooled data from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank interim data release, totaling 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 CBP cases. We used logistic regression models with additive genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. The threshold for genome-wide significance was set at p<5×10−8.

    Main Findings: We identified a genome-wide significant association between the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 and CBP (OR 1.08, p=7.2×10−10). This association was replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample (OR 1.06, p=5.3×10−11) and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (OR 1.07, p=4.5×10−19). We also found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p=4.4×10−13), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC (OR 0.97, p=2.4×10−10).

    Implications: This study provides the first reported meta-analysis of GWAS for CBP and identifies a genetic locus associated with CBP (SOX5). The replication of this association in an independent sample and the identification of two other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis (CCDC26/GSDMC and DCC) highlight the potential of GWAS to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying CBP.

    Conclusions: Our findings suggest that genetic variants in SOX5, CCDC26/GSDMC, and DCC may contribute to the development of CBP. Further investigation of these loci may provide insights into the underlying biology of CBP and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this debilitating condition.

    Title: Estimating the Burden of Taenia solium Cysticercosis in West Cameroon: A Cost and Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) Analysis

    Background: Taenia solium cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic disease that affects both humans and pigs in many developing countries. Human neurocysticercosis is a significant cause of epilepsy in endemic regions, but its burden is largely underreported. This study aimed to estimate the impact of T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon using a cost and DALY analysis.

    Methods: We collected data on the prevalence of epilepsy and cysticercosis in humans and pigs in West Cameroon. Using R software, we applied different distributions to estimate the number of people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy and pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis. We also calculated the total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis, including losses in pig husbandry and direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis.

    Main Findings: Our estimates suggest that 50,326 people (95% CI: 37,299-65,924) in West Cameroon have neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy, representing 1.0% of the local population. The number of pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis was estimated at 15,961 (95% CI: 12,320-20,044), corresponding to 5.6% of the local pig population. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis were estimated at €10,255,202 (95% CI: €6,889,048-€14,754,044), with 4.7% attributed to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis.

    Implications: This study provides an estimation of the costs and DALYs lost due to T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon, highlighting the significant burden of this neglected zoonotic disease. Our findings suggest that the cost of inactivity, influenced by salaries, plays a predominant role in the monetary burden of T. solium cysticercosis. The estimated number of DALYs lost due to the disease was higher than estimates available for some other neglected tropical diseases.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of considering both the human and animal burden of T. solium cysticercosis in estimating the disease burden. The estimated costs and DALYs lost likely underestimate the real values, as the estimations were based on epilepsy as the only symptom of cysticercosis. Further studies are needed to ascertain these findings and estimate the global disease burden of cysticercosis.

    **Title:** RsaA, a Sigma B-dependent Small RNA, Regulates Virulence and Biofilm Formation in Staphylococcus aureus

    **Research Question:** What is the role of RsaA, a non-coding RNA, in regulating virulence and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the function and mechanism of action of RsaA, a Sigma B-dependent small RNA, in Staphylococcus aureus. We generated mutant strains lacking RsaA and analyzed their phenotypes, including biofilm formation, capsule synthesis, and opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that RsaA represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator MgrA by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. This repression leads to enhanced production of biofilm and decreased synthesis of capsule formation in several strain backgrounds. Consequently, RsaA causes a decreased protection of S. aureus against opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection in mice. We propose that RsaA takes part in a regulatory network that contributes to the complex interactions of S. aureus with the host immune system to moderate invasiveness and favor chronic infections.

    **Conclusions:** RsaA is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. We propose that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host. Our study highlights the importance of non-coding RNAs in regulating virulence and biofilm formation in S. aureus, and provides new insights into the complex interactions between S. aureus and the host immune system.

    **Title:** Visualizing HIV-1 Uncoating in Living Cells using a Novel Cyclophilin A-DsRed Chimera

    **Research Question:** What are the spatio-temporal features of HIV-1 uncoating in living cells, and how does this process contribute to the establishment of a life-long infection?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel assay using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of cyclophilin A (CypA-DsRed) to visualize HIV-1 uncoating in living cells. CypA-DsRed was specifically packaged into virions through high-avidity binding to the HIV-1 capsid (CA). Single virus imaging revealed that CypA-DsRed remained associated with cores after permeabilization/removal of the viral membrane and was lost concomitantly with CA in vitro and in living cells.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the majority of single cores lose CypA-DsRed shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late times post-infection revealed a gradual loss of CypA-DsRed dependent on reverse transcription. Uncoating occurred both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. The rate of CypA-DsRed loss was modulated by core stability and was accelerated upon the initiation of reverse transcription.

    **Implications:** Our novel imaging assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells, revealing the previously unappreciated spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of HIV-1 entry and the establishment of a life-long infection.

    **Conclusions:** The CypA-DsRed chimera provides a novel and specific probe for visualizing HIV-1 uncoating in living cells. Our results demonstrate that uncoating occurs both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane, and that the rate of CypA-DsRed loss is modulated by core stability and reverse transcription. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 entry and highlight the importance of uncoating in the establishment of a life-long infection.

    **Title:** Investigating Oligonucleotide Frequencies in Prokaryotic Genomes: Implications for DNA Composition and Sequence Patterns

    **Research Question:** How do oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions of prokaryotic genomes, and what are the implications for DNA composition and sequence patterns?

    **Methods:** We analyzed oligonucleotide frequencies from di- to octanucleotides in all sequenced bacterial and archaeal chromosomes (up to September 2006) with GC contents between 47% and 53%. Statistical tests were performed to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA "word-sizes" and explore how oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short-range correlated, with information encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. Bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that GC-rich genomes are more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. The differences found between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was, on average, more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that oligonucleotide frequencies can provide valuable insights into DNA composition and sequence patterns in prokaryotic genomes. Our results highlight the importance of considering oligonucleotide sizes larger than hexanucleotides, which possess little additional information potential in prokaryotic DNA. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution and function of prokaryotic genomes and may inform the development of new bioinformatics tools for analyzing genomic data.

    **Title:** Unveiling a Novel Form of Biased Gene Conversion in Human Recombination Hotspots

    **Background:** Meiotic recombination is a crucial process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity. While significant progress has been made in understanding factors influencing recombination initiation, little is known about factors acting downstream. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the transmission of allelic variants at six highly active recombination hotspots in human sperm DNA.

    **Research Question:** Do cis-acting influences affect the transmission of allelic variants at recombination hotspots, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We simultaneously analyzed both types of recombinant molecules (crossovers and noncrossovers) in sperm DNA at six highly active hotspots and looked for disparities in the transmission of allelic variants indicative of cis-acting influences.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a novel form of biased transmission that was exclusive to the noncrossover class of recombinant molecules at two of the hotspots. This form of biased gene conversion arises through differences in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrossovers. Notably, this form of biased gene conversion favors strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) base pairs, consistent with established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes.

    **Implications:** This novel form of biased gene conversion constitutes a powerful and previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive that may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of genomic base composition and the correlation between GC content and recombination activity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a previously unknown mechanism of biased gene conversion that acts downstream of recombination initiation. This discovery highlights the complexity of meiotic recombination and underscores the need for further investigation into the factors influencing recombination-driven meiotic drive. Our findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of the human genome and may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the correlation between GC content and recombination activity.

    **Title:** Predicting Human Health Risks from Environmental Chemicals and Drugs: A Systems Chemical Biology Approach

    **Research Question:** Can a computational systems biology model integrate toxicogenomics data, chemical structures, protein-protein interaction data, disease information, and functional annotation to predict high-level associations between chemical exposures and diseases, as well as detailed associations between chemicals and proteins?

    **Methods:** We developed a high-confidence human protein-protein association network by integrating the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) with other data types. We selected 42,194 associations between 2,490 unique compounds and 6,060 molecular targets known to be involved in human disease. We then analyzed selected clusters to identify new chemical-disease associations.

    **Main Findings:** Our computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, predicting which compounds may be risk factors for human health. We identified potential protein targets for di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine, associated with breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis.

    **Implications:** Our approach provides necessary data to develop computational systems biology models that can predict both high-level associations (linking chemical exposures to diseases) and more detailed associations (linking chemicals to proteins). This model can be used to identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals and proteins, highlighting the importance of integrating toxicogenomics data with other data types.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of integrating toxicogenomics data with other data types to predict human health risks from environmental chemicals and drugs. This approach can be used to identify new molecular targets for chemicals and link them to diseases, providing a valuable tool for risk assessment and disease prevention. Future studies should focus on analyzing environmental chemicals with similar gene expression profiles to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying chemical-induced diseases.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of Cortical Sensory Processing: A Nonlinear Feedforward Network Model of Auditory Cortical Neurons

    **Research Question:** How do primary auditory cortical neurons process complex auditory stimuli, and what are the underlying nonlinear mechanisms that govern their responses?

    **Methods:** We employed a nonlinear feedforward network model (Network Receptive Field, NRF) to analyze the responses of primary auditory cortical neurons to natural sounds. The NRF model consisted of 1-7 sub-receptive fields that interacted nonlinearly to predict neural responses.

    **Main Findings:** Our results revealed that primary auditory cortical neurons are sensitive to a substantially larger spectrotemporal domain than previously thought, as characterized by their standard spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). The NRF model consistently outperformed STRFs and linear-nonlinear (LN) models in predicting neural responses to auditory stimuli. Furthermore, the NRF model uncovered distinct nonlinear properties, including gain control and conjunctive feature selectivity, which are critical to auditory cortex function.

    **Implications:** The NRF model provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of cortical sensory processing, highlighting the importance of nonlinear interactions between sub-receptive fields. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of sound recognition and processing in the auditory cortex.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that fitting auditory cortical neural responses with feedforward network models expands on simple linear receptive field models, yielding substantially improved predictive power and revealing key nonlinear aspects of cortical processing. The NRF model offers a parsimonious and interpretable framework for understanding the complex nonlinear signal processing strategies used by the auditory brain. These findings have important implications for the development of more accurate models of auditory processing and may shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying sound recognition and perception.

    Title: Unveiling the Role of CK2-Mediated Circadian BMAL1 Phosphorylation in the Mammalian Core Clock Oscillator

    Research Question: What is the underlying mechanism of CK2-mediated circadian BMAL1 phosphorylation in the mammalian core clock oscillator?

    Methods: Using a novel clock-perturbing peptide, we investigated the role of casein kinase 2 (CK2) in regulating central and peripheral core clocks. We employed co-immunoprecipitation experiments, real-time monitoring of protein-protein interactions, and biochemical assays to elucidate the molecular mechanism of CK2-mediated circadian BMAL1 phosphorylation.

    Main Findings: Our study reveals a novel role of CRY proteins as repressors of CK2 protein kinase activity toward BMAL1-S90. We found that CRY-mediated periodic binding of CK2β to BMAL1 inhibits BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation by CK2α. Furthermore, we identified the FAD binding domain of CRY1, two C-terminal BMAL1 domains, and particularly BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT1 as critical for CRY-mediated BMAL1–CK2β binding. Reciprocally, BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation is prerequisite for BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation.

    Implications: Our findings propose a dual negative-feedback model in which a CRY-dependent CK2-driven posttranslational BMAL1–P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator. This loop forms a distinct interlocked loop in the clock machinery and has integral roles in the core circadian oscillator through periodic CRY-mediated negative feedback suppression.

    Conclusions: We established a circadian clock-controlling role of CK2 kinase in BMAL1 phosphorylation and uncovered a novel role of CRY as a regulator of cyclic CK2-mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of the CK2-mediated posttranslational loop and its role in regulating the intracellular circadian core oscillator. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the mammalian circadian clock and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for circadian-related disorders.

    **Title:** Mechanisms of Salmonella enterica Adaptation to Bile: A Multifaceted Response to a Host Defense Mechanism

    **Research Question:** How does the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapt to the antibacterial activity of bile, a key component of the host's defense mechanism in the hepatobiliary tract?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vitro experiments and genetic analysis to investigate the mechanisms of Salmonella adaptation to bile. Sublethal concentrations of the bile salt sodium deoxycholate (DOC) were used to induce adaptation in Salmonella cultures, which were then analyzed for changes in gene expression and bile resistance.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Salmonella adaptation to bile involves multiple changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. We found that the general stress response plays a crucial role in adaptation to bile, as RpoS mutants are sensitive to bile. Furthermore, we observed that individual cells within a non-adapted culture can become bile-resistant without adaptation, and that this phenomenon is associated with fluctuations in gene expression. Full genome sequencing of bile-resistant mutants revealed that alteration of the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery is a frequent cause of mutational bile resistance.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Salmonella adaptation to bile is a multifaceted response that involves both adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms. We propose that non-mutational preadaptation to bile may be caused by the activation of bile-resistance responses in the absence of bile, and that this phenomenon may be relevant during Salmonella colonization of the hepatobiliary tract. Our results also highlight the importance of phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations of bacteria and the adaptive value of gene expression fluctuations.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Salmonella adaptation to bile, a key component of the host's defense mechanism in the hepatobiliary tract. Our findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat these infections.

    **Title:** Compaction of the E. coli Chromosome into Supercoiled Domains: The Case of Prophage Mu

    **Research Question:** How is the E. coli chromosome compacted into supercoiled domains, and what role do prophages like Mu play in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed Cre-loxP recombination and 3C (chromosome conformation capture) to investigate the organization of the E. coli chromosome and the prophage Mu. We analyzed the formation and maintenance of the Mu domain at two different chromosomal locations.

    **Main Findings:** We found that prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by the proximal location of Mu termini L and R, which are 37 kbp apart on the Mu genome. The formation and maintenance of the Mu domain depend on a strong gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, the Mu L end, MuB protein, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis, and HU. We also observed that low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the Mu domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by fostering topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may also contribute to its long-term stability.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals that the E. coli chromosome is compacted into supercoiled domains by both active and passive mechanisms, including transcription and DNA-protein association. We propose a model for the Mu prophage domain that incorporates our findings with earlier proposals, highlighting the importance of SGS, Mu proteins, and host NAPs in its formation and maintenance. Our results provide new insights into the organization of the E. coli chromosome and the role of prophages in shaping its structure and function.

    **Title:** Efficacy of Primaquine in Preventing Plasmodium vivax Relapses and Reducing Gametocyte Carriage in Papua New Guinean Children

    **Background:** Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed antimalarial drug that prevents Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocytes, thereby reducing post-treatment transmission. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of PQ in preventing Pv relapses and reducing gametocyte carriage in school-aged children in Papua New Guinea.

    **Methods:** A randomized treatment-to-reinfection cohort study was conducted in Papua New Guinean children who received radical cure with Chloroquine, Artemether-Lumefantrine, plus either PQ or placebo. Blood samples were collected at 2- to 4-weekly intervals over 8 months to detect Pv and Pf gametocytes using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR targeting pvs25 and pfs25.

    **Main Findings:** PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which was comparable to the effect of PQ on incidence of blood-stage infections. Notably, 92% of Pv and 79% of Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of gametocytes were significantly reduced in mixed-species infections compared to single-species infections for both species.

    **Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv. PQ treatment prevented relapses and thus reduced Pv gametocyte carriage by 73%. The study also suggests that Pv relapses and new infections are associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia, emphasizing the need for effective anti-hypnozoite treatment.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the efficacy of PQ in preventing Pv relapses and reducing gametocyte carriage in school-aged children in Papua New Guinea. The findings support the use of PQ treatment for all Pv infections and highlight the importance of sensitive detection and early treatment of asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium spp. infections to control transmission.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Rho GTPase Cycling in Actin Organization: A Modeling Framework for Understanding Differential Regulation

    **Background:** The Rho family of GTPases, comprising RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, plays a crucial role in controlling actin organization during various cellular responses, including migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. While the primary members of this family exhibit distinct downstream effects on actin remodeling, their basic mechanism involves targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding.

    **Research Question:** What are the key details of GTPase cycling between the membrane and cytosol that underlie the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches?

    **Methods:** We developed a modeling framework to analyze experimental data for Rho GTPase systems, focusing on GDI-mediated cycling and distinguishing between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis of Rac membrane cycling reveals that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. We present non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase in multidimensional charts, illustrating the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane-bound GTPase.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that the Rho-GTPase cycling can access qualitatively diverse pathways in different cellular systems or through different experimental manipulations. The charts presented here can be used as a guide to assess how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the Rho GTPase cycling mechanism, highlighting the importance of GDI-mediated and -independent mechanisms in regulating actin organization. Our modeling framework offers a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data and predicting the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities on GTPase cycling, ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with Rho GTPase dysregulation.

    **Title:** Assessing the Impact of Adult Infection Burden on Schistosomiasis Control: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How does the age distribution of Schistosoma mansoni infection, particularly the burden of infection in adults, impact the mathematical model-generated recommendations for preventive chemotherapy coverage levels required to achieve the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem for schistosomiasis?

    **Methods:** We employed a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the impact of three different age-intensity profiles of infection (low, moderate, and high burdens of infection in adults) on the treatment coverage levels required to achieve the WHO goals. We analyzed data from school-aged children (SAC) and adults to determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that for moderate prevalence regions, treating SAC only may achieve the WHO goals, regardless of the burden of infection in adults. However, for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet the WHO goals. These findings highlight the importance of considering the burden of infection in adults when determining the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region.

    **Implications:** Our study emphasizes the need for more accurate and detailed data from monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programmes to determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region. We recommend collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, specifically including adult data at baseline and throughout the treatment programme, rather than relying solely on SAC data. Additionally, we suggest collecting epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, to inform treatment strategies.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region cannot be based solely on the prevalence of infection in SAC. The burden of infection in adults must be considered to accurately determine the required treatment coverage levels. By incorporating adult data into M&E programmes, we can develop more effective and targeted treatment strategies to control and eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem.

    **Title:** Predicting Surgical Outcomes in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy using Patient-Specific Computational Modeling

    **Research Question:** Can a computational model of epilepsy, derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, predict surgical outcomes in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)?

    **Methods:** We developed a bistable model of epilepsy using DTI data from 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls. We validated the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and network location. We then performed in silico surgical resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery simulations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that patients with TLE tend to transit from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. We found that regions in the left hemisphere, particularly within temporal and subcortical regions, are the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients. Additionally, our analysis implicates regions in the contralateral and frontal locations that may play a role in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. Notably, the model predicts that patient-specific surgery, chosen on an individual basis using the model, may lead to better outcomes than the currently used routine clinical procedure.

    **Implications:** Our study provides a first step towards patient-specific computational modeling of epilepsy surgery, which may inform treatment strategies in individuals. The model's ability to predict seizure likelihood post-surgery suggests that it may be a valuable tool for clinicians to optimize surgical planning and improve patient outcomes.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of computational modeling to predict surgical outcomes in TLE. By using patient-specific DTI data and a bistable model, we were able to identify regions involved in seizure initiation and spreading, and predict the effectiveness of patient-specific surgery. These findings have important implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients with TLE. Future studies should aim to validate these results in larger cohorts and explore the potential of this approach for other types of epilepsy.

    **Title:** Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) Utilizes vIRF-1 to Inactivate Bim, a Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Member, via Nuclear Translocation

    **Research Question:** How does Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) counteract pro-apoptotic signals induced by infection of the host cell, and what is the role of viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) in this process?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including immunofluorescence assays, western analysis of fractionated cell extracts, co-precipitation assays, and deletion and point mutagenesis, to investigate the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member.

    **Main Findings:** We identified that vIRF-1 directly targets and inactivates Bim via nuclear translocation, a novel mechanism of Bim inactivation. vIRF-1-mediated relocalization of Bim was observed in transfected cells and lytically infected endothelial cells. Co-precipitation assays revealed a direct interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim, and deletion and point mutagenesis mapped the Bim-binding residues of vIRF-1. Generation and experimental utilization of Bim-refractory vIRF-1 variants confirmed the importance of vIRF-1:Bim interaction in pro-replication and anti-apoptotic activity of vIRF-1.

    **Implications:** The data presented reveal a novel mechanism utilized by HHV-8 to control replication-induced apoptosis and suggest that inhibitory targeting of vIRF-1:Bim interaction may provide an effective antiviral strategy.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that HHV-8 utilizes vIRF-1 to inactivate Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, via nuclear translocation. The interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim is essential for vIRF-1-mediated protection from lytic cycle-induced apoptosis and is a critical component of vIRF-1 activity. Disruption of this regulation could provide a unique and useful means of controlling HHV-8 productive replication, highlighting the potential for inhibitory targeting of vIRF-1:Bim interaction as an antiviral strategy.

    **Title:** Loss of Epithelial αVβ6 Integrin Alters Lung Microenvironment and Enhances Protection against Respiratory Infections

    **Research Question:** How does the upregulation of epithelial αVβ6 integrin contribute to the development of acute lung injury (ALI) during respiratory infections, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of αVβ6 integrin in ALI using β6-deficient mice (β6 KO) and wild-type (WT) controls. Mice were infected with influenza virus, Sendai virus, or subjected to bacterial pneumonia. We analyzed lung morphology, immune cell populations, cytokine expression, and type I IFN signaling activity.

    **Main Findings:** β6 KO mice exhibited reduced ALI and improved survival during influenza infection, characterized by decreased edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability. β6 KO mice had altered baseline homeostasis, with increased CD11b+ CD11c+ macrophages and elevated type I IFN signaling activity. TGF-β1'rescue' experiments and β6 KO mice lacking type I IFN signaling revealed that the resistance of β6 KO mice to influenza depended on the loss of TGF-β1 and elevated type I IFN signaling. Macrophages from TGF-β1-treated β6 KO mice displayed decreased mRNA encoding levels of IFN-associated transcripts.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the upregulation of αVβ6 integrin during respiratory infections contributes to the development of ALI through the activation of TGF-β. The loss of β6-mediated TGF-β activation leads to an altered lung microenvironment, characterized by constitutively activated lung CD11b+ alveolar macrophages and elevated type I IFN signaling activity. This altered microenvironment enhances protection against respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus, Sendai virus, and bacterial pneumonia.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the loss of one epithelial protein, αVβ6 integrin, can alter the lung microenvironment during both homeostasis and respiratory infection, leading to reduced lung injury and improved survival. These findings highlight the importance of αVβ6 integrin in modulating the immune response during respiratory infections and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat ALI.
Title: Evaluation of Leishmanin Skin Test as a Diagnostic Complement for Leishmaniasis in the Americas: A Retrospective Analysis of 733 Cases

    Abstract:

    Leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, is a significant public health concern in the Americas, with cutaneous and mucosal manifestations being the most common forms of the disease. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is often challenging due to the low parasite burden in lesions. The Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) is a supportive tool for diagnosis, based on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to Leishmania antigens. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 733 cases of leishmaniasis evaluated at a reference center in Argentina between 2006 and 2015 to assess the usefulness of LST as a diagnostic complement.

    Methods: We analyzed demographic, clinical, and diagnostic data from individuals with clinically compatible lesions, including lesion smears and LST results. A total of 733 cases met the case definition, with 93% being localized cutaneous cases, 7% with mucosal involvement, and <1% disseminated.

    Main Findings: Diagnostic confirmation was achieved in 65% of cases through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases having negative LST results among this group. Among smear-negative cases, 190 were also negative by LST, but 69 instances had positive LST results. The sensitivity of LST was similar across age groups, and lesions older than 21 days correlated significantly with positive results for both smear and LST.

    Implications: Our findings support the clinical use of LST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis across all age groups, even in endemic areas. The high correlation between LST and smear results suggests that LST can be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of leishmaniasis, particularly in cases with low parasite burden.

    Conclusions: Standardization of LST protocols and further research into its optimal preparation and utilization across different sites are necessary to improve the management of suspicious clinical cases. Our study highlights the potential of LST as a supportive tool for leishmaniasis diagnosis, particularly in regions with limited access to diagnostic resources.

    Title: Elucidating the Genetic Mechanisms of Coronary Artery Disease through Epigenetic Changes in Macrophages Exposed to Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (oxLDL)

    Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), but the causal mechanisms underlying most of these loci remain unknown. Recent studies suggest that many GWAS variants influence disease through altered transcriptional regulation in disease-relevant cell types.

    Methods: We employed a combination of open chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq) and enhancer and transcription factor mapping using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to oxLDL, resulting in foam cell formation.

    Main Findings: OxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites that strongly correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. OxLDL-regulated enhancers were enriched for several transcription factors, including C/EBP-beta, which has no previously documented role in foam cell formation. Variants at CAD-associated loci were significantly and specifically enriched in the subset of chromatin sites altered by oxLDL exposure, including rs72664324 in an oxLDL-induced enhancer at the PPAP2B locus. OxLDL increased C/EBP-beta binding to this site, and C/EBP-beta binding and enhancer activity were stronger with the protective A allele of rs72664324.

    Implications: Our results demonstrate a genetic mechanism contributing to CAD risk at the PPAP2B locus and highlight the value of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli. The findings provide a detailed map of the epigenetic changes arising from exposure of macrophages to oxLDL and offer a rational basis for the study of approaches to ameliorate foam cell formation.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the transcriptional pathways mediating the effect of oxLDL on gene expression in macrophages and highlights the importance of epigenetic changes in the pathogenesis of CAD. The identification of C/EBP-beta as a key transcription factor in foam cell formation and the association of CAD variants with oxLDL-induced enhancers at the PPAP2B locus provide a new understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying CAD risk.

    **Title:** One Round of Azithromycin Mass Treatment Reduces Trachomatous Inflammation-Follicular Prevalence to <5% in Malawi Districts with Baseline Prevalence of 5.0-9.9%

    **Research Question:** Can a single round of azithromycin mass treatment (MDA) with approximately 80% coverage effectively reduce trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%?

    **Methods:** We conducted population-based trachoma surveys in 18 evaluation units of 8 Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9% after a single round of azithromycin MDA with approximately 80% coverage. The surveys were conducted at least 6 months after the MDA, using the standardized training package and survey methodologies of Tropical Data, which conform to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.

    **Main Findings:** The results show that all 18 evaluation units had a TF1-9 prevalence of <5.0%, indicating a significant reduction in TF prevalence following the MDA. This finding suggests that one round of azithromycin MDA with high coverage may be sufficient to eliminate active trachoma in Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%.

    **Implications:** This study provides evidence that a single round of azithromycin MDA can effectively reduce TF prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%. This finding has significant implications for trachoma elimination efforts in Malawi and potentially in other countries with similar epidemiological profiles.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that one round of azithromycin MDA with approximately 80% coverage can be an effective strategy for reducing TF prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%. Further evidence from other settings is needed to confirm these findings, but this study provides optimism that Malawi may be able to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Complex Signaling Mechanisms Downstream of Nucleotide-Binding Domain Leucine-Rich Repeat (NLR) Immune Sensors in Plants

    **Research Question:** How do distinct intracellular and cell-surface immune sensors trigger overlapping or differential primary immune signaling responses in plants?

    **Background:** Plants have evolved sophisticated innate immune systems to defend against pathogen attacks without specialized immune cells and the adaptive immune system. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are intracellular immune sensors that recognize pathogen-encoded effectors to initiate complex immune responses, including a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, transcriptional reprogramming, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and programmed cell death (PCD).

    **Methods:** Functional genomic and biochemical genetic screens identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) that mediate bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins, RPS2 and RPM1. The dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death, while sustained CPK4/5/6/11 activation directly phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors, WRKY8/28/48, to synergistically regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth.

    **Main Findings:** Our studies delineate the bifurcation of complex signaling mechanisms downstream of NLR immune sensors mediated by the myriad action of CPKs with distinct substrate specificity and subcellular dynamics. Specifically, CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production, while CPK4/5/6/11 phosphorylate WRKY transcription factors for transcriptional reprogramming. These findings provide genetic evidence that Ca2+ signaling via specific CPKs plays pivotal roles in the diverse downstream signaling and pathogen resistance mediated by distinct intracellular NLR immune sensors.

    **Implications:** This study sheds light on the complex signaling mechanisms downstream of NLR immune sensors and highlights the importance of Ca2+ signaling in plant immune responses. The identification of specific CPKs and WRKY transcription factors involved in NLR-dependent immune responses provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions and may lead to the development of novel strategies for plant disease resistance.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that distinct intracellular and cell-surface immune sensors trigger overlapping or differential primary immune signaling responses in plants, and that Ca2+ signaling via specific CPKs plays a crucial role in mediating these responses. The identification of specific CPKs and WRKY transcription factors involved in NLR-dependent immune responses provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant immune responses and may lead to the development of novel strategies for plant disease resistance.

    Title: Parsimonious Forecasting of Schistosoma haematobium Incidence in Niono, Mali: A Longitudinal Retrospective Study

    Research Question: Can general-purpose exponential smoothing methods, encapsulated within a state-space framework, be used to generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts of Schistosoma haematobium incidence in the district of Niono, Mali?

    Methods: A longitudinal retrospective study was conducted from 01/1996 to 06/2004, where the Schistosoma haematobium time-series for the district of Niono, Mali, was fitted with general-purpose exponential smoothing methods to generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts. The state-space framework accommodated seasonal and inter-annual time-series fluctuations.

    Main Findings: The exponential smoothing state-space framework produced reasonably accurate forecasts for the Schistosoma haematobium time-series, with mean absolute percentage error values of circa 25% for 1- to 5-month horizon forecasts. The framework obliquely captured prior non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous covariates, such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions.

    Implications: This study demonstrates the potential of parsimonious forecasting and early warning systems to enhance management of Schistosoma haematobium transmission and intervention impact in the district of Niono, Mali, and potentially elsewhere in the Sahel. The findings suggest that general-purpose exponential smoothing methods, encapsulated within a state-space framework, can be used to generate accurate forecasts of Schistosoma haematobium incidence, obviating the need for more complex forecasting methods.

    Conclusions: This study addresses the paucity of Schistosoma haematobium time-series forecasting investigations and advocates the usage of parsimonious state-space frameworks to forecast neglected tropical diseases. The results of this study have significant implications for public health programs in developing countries, where Schistosoma haematobium imposes a substantial burden on the health of infected individuals. By providing accurate and timely forecasts, public health programs can enhance management and control of this parasitic infection, ultimately improving public health outcomes in developing countries.

    **Title:** Coordinated Cell Cycle Synchronization by Human Cytomegalovirus Tegument Proteins pp150 and pUL21a Facilitates Productive Infection

    **Research Question:** How do human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) tegument proteins pp150 and pUL21a regulate cell cycle progression to facilitate productive infection?

    **Methods:** We employed a cyclin A-binding deficient pp150 mutant virus and a double-point mutant where both pp150 and pUL21a are disabled in cyclin A interaction to investigate the role of these proteins in HCMV infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that pp150 restricts viral gene expression to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle by binding to cyclin A, while pUL21a destabilizes cyclin A to maintain a virus-permissive G2-arrest. A double-point mutant where both pp150 and pUL21a are disabled in cyclin A interaction forced mitotic entry of the majority of infected cells, resulting in a severe negative impact on cell viability and virus growth.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that pp150 and pUL21a functionally cooperate to build a cell cycle synchronization strategy that is essential for productive HCMV infection. This mechanism restricts viral gene expression to the G0/G1 phase, where cyclin A expression is low or absent, and prevents fatal entry into mitosis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the pp150-cyclin A-dependent restriction of viral gene expression to G0/G1 and the pUL21a-cyclin A-dependent cell cycle block cooperate to protect HCMV from fatal entry into mitosis. These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between HCMV and host cell cycle regulation, and highlight the importance of cell cycle synchronization in the productive replication cycle of HCMV.
Title: Elucidating the Genetic Etiology of Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Targeted Sequencing Approach

    Abstract:
    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration, resulting in paralysis and death. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, while the remaining 90% are sporadic. Despite significant advances in identifying causative mutations in familial ALS, the genetic underpinnings of approximately 30% of familial cases and the majority of sporadic cases remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a targeted sequencing approach to investigate 169 known and candidate ALS disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls. Our results reveal a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, suggesting that we are likely identifying disease-associated mutations. This study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing techniques, combined with functional studies and rare variant analysis tools, to provide insight into the genetic etiology of sporadic ALS.

    Methods:
    We employed a candidate gene approach to discover new mutations in biologically relevant ALS genes using sporadic ALS cases. We utilized a large array of tools to study newly identified variants and assess their relevance to disease. Functional studies were conducted, when possible, to compare newly identified variants with other ALS variants. Bioinformatics tools were used to assess variant pathogenicity, and a rare variant binning approach was employed to demonstrate that cases have a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls.

    Main Findings:
    We identified rare or novel variants in 144 of the 242 patients sequenced, suggesting that at least 40% of cases have no potential genetic cause for ALS that we could identify with our sequencing method and set of candidate genes. We also identified new variants in known ALS disease genes, as well as in genes associated with ALS, and found no association between several previously identified SNPs and ALS in our population, with the exception of APOE. Furthermore, we identified new variants in genes identified through our trio and RRM studies.

    Implications:
    This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation sequencing techniques in identifying novel and rare variants associated with sporadic ALS. Our findings suggest that a significant proportion of sporadic ALS cases may be attributed to mutations in a set of key genes. The results of this study have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of ALS, highlighting the need for further research into the genetic underpinnings of this complex disease.

    Conclusions:
    This study provides new insights into the genetic etiology of sporadic ALS, underscoring the importance of next-generation sequencing techniques in identifying novel and rare variants associated with disease. Our findings suggest that a significant proportion of sporadic ALS cases may be attributed to mutations in a set of key genes, and highlight the need for further research into the genetic underpinnings of this complex disease.

    **Title:** Interleukin-6 Regulates CD4+ T Cell Memory to Influenza Virus by Suppressing Virus-Specific Regulatory T Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the role of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus, particularly in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells?

    **Methods:** We analyzed virus-specific T cell activity in both wild-type (WT) and IL-6 deficient (IL-6−/−) mice after infection with influenza virus.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals a novel role for IL-6 in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus. Specifically, we found that CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell memory is critically dependent on IL-6. IL-6 suppresses CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. We demonstrate that influenza-induced IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific Tregs, favoring pathogen clearance and host survival.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that IL-6 plays a critical role in ensuring that antigen-specific Tregs do not down-modulate the immune response during an acute infection with a cytopathic virus, thereby promoting pathogen clearance and host survival.

    **Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of IL-6 in regulating CD4+ T cell memory to influenza virus by suppressing virus-specific Tregs. Our results have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying cell-mediated immunity and the development of T cell memory to respiratory viruses. The findings also suggest that IL-6 may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing T cell memory responses to influenza virus.

    **Key Takeaways:**

    * IL-6 regulates CD4+ T cell memory to influenza virus by suppressing virus-specific Tregs.
    * CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell memory is critically dependent on IL-6.
    * IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific Tregs, facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells.
    * Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying cell-mediated immunity and the development of T cell memory to respiratory viruses.

    **Title:** Identification of Enolase as a Dnmt2-Binding Protein and Its Role in Modulating Dnmt2 Activity in Entamoeba histolytica

    **Research Question:** What is the role of enolase in modulating the activity of Dnmt2, a cytosine-5 methyltransferase of the Dnmt2 family, in Entamoeba histolytica?

    **Methods:** A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify enolase as a Dnmt2-binding protein. Enolase, a glycolytic enzyme, was shown to have both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in E. histolytica. The interaction between enolase and Dnmt2 was further characterized using in vitro binding assays.

    **Main Findings:** Enolase was found to act as a Dnmt2 inhibitor, and its inhibitory activity was antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG), a substrate of enolase. Glucose starvation led to the accumulation of enolase in the nucleus, where it formed a complex with the E. histolytica Dnmt2 homolog (Ehmeth), resulting in a significant reduction of tRNAAsp methylation. The role of enolase as a Dnmt2 inhibitor was also demonstrated in E. histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-fused-enolase.

    **Implications:** These findings establish enolase as the first Dnmt2-interacting protein and highlight an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity. The results also suggest a link between glucose metabolism and Dnmt2 activity. Furthermore, the study provides evidence that Dnmt2 is a tRNA methyltransferase in lower eukaryotes.

    **Conclusions:** This investigation provides in vivo and in vitro evidence that establishes enolase as the first Dnmt2-interacting protein. The results also suggest that the interaction between enolase and Dnmt2 is conserved outside the Entamoeba genus, as Drosophila and human Dnmt2 proteins were able to bind to enolase in vitro. These findings open up new avenues for research on the role of tRNA methylation in E. histolytica and the significance of enolase-Dnmt2 interaction in higher eukaryotes.
Title: Identification of Exogenous MicroRNAs in Mosquito Saliva and Their Role in Chikungunya Virus Infection

    Abstract:
    Background: Mosquito saliva is a complex concoction of secretory factors that modulate the feeding foci to enhance pathogen infection and establishment. While multiple salivary proteins/factors have been identified to enhance pathogen infection, the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mosquito saliva has not been previously reported.

    Research Question: Do exogenous miRNAs exist in mosquito saliva, and do they play a role in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection?

    Methods: Next-generation sequencing was used to identify miRNAs in the saliva of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Deep sequencing was performed on uninfected and CHIKV-infected mosquito saliva to investigate the effect of CHIKV infection on saliva miRNA expression profiles.

    Main Findings: A total of 103 mature miRNAs were discovered in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus saliva, of which 31 were previously unidentified and designated as novel. Several miRNAs were expressed only in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes. Five saliva miRNAs were tested for their potential to regulate CHIKV infection, and our results demonstrate their functional role in transmission and establishment of infection during blood feeding on the host.

    Implications: The presence of exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva and their upregulation in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes most likely enhances CHIKV replication and dissemination in the host and at the site of infection. Inhibiting these miRNAs decreased viral replication, suggesting that they play a crucial role in the transmission and establishment of CHIKV infection.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first report on the identification of exogenous mosquito saliva microRNAs and demonstrates their functional role in CHIKV infection. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and may lead to the development of novel strategies for the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases.
Title: Investigating the Role of Nuclear Double-Strand Break Repair Proteins in Mitochondrial DNA Repair

    Abstract:
    Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are a major cause of maternally inherited diseases, cancers, and neurological disorders. These deletions are often flanked by short, repetitive sequences, suggesting that they result from recombination events. However, the mechanisms of mtDNA repair and maintenance are poorly understood compared to nuclear DNA repair. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of nuclear double-strand break repair (DSBR) proteins Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p in mtDNA repair.

    Methods:
    We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to investigate the role of Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p in mtDNA repair. A mitochondrially-targeted restriction endonuclease (mtLS-KpnI) was used to introduce a unique double-strand break (DSB) in the mitochondrial genome, allowing for direct analysis of DSB repair in vivo.

    Main Findings:
    We found that both Rad51p and Rad59p are localized to the matrix of the mitochondria and that Rad51p binds directly to mitochondrial DNA. Loss of these three proteins significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous deletion events and impaired the repair of induced mtDNA DSBs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p impact the rate of spontaneous mitochondrial DNA deletions and the repair of induced mitochondrial DSBs in yeast.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p play a crucial role in mtDNA repair, particularly in the repair of DSBs. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of mtDNA repair and highlights the importance of these proteins in maintaining mtDNA integrity. The identification of mitochondrial-specific factors that interact with Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p will help elucidate the mitochondrial-specific repair pathways or pathway components.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates that Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p are essential for mtDNA repair, particularly in the repair of DSBs. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of mtDNA mutagenesis and repair, and highlight the importance of these proteins in maintaining mtDNA integrity. Future studies will focus on identifying mitochondrial-specific factors that interact with Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p to elucidate the mitochondrial-specific repair pathways or pathway components.
Title: Systematic Review of the Association between Social Determinants of Health and Group A Streptococcal Infection, Acute Rheumatic Fever, and Rheumatic Heart Disease

    Abstract:

    Background: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) poses a significant disease burden among disadvantaged populations worldwide, resulting from acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a complication of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection. The role of specific social and environmental factors in GAS infection and progression to ARF/RHD is not well understood. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS infection, ARF, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these factors.

    Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. Observational and experimental studies that measured crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, employment, income, nutrition, or socioeconomic status and their relationship with GAS infection, ARF, or RHD were included. Study quality was assessed using a standardized tool, and findings were evaluated against the Bradford Hill criteria for evidence of causation.

    Main Findings: A total of 1,164 publications were identified, with 90 meeting the inclusion criteria, comprising 91 individual studies. The majority of studies (57.1%) reported significant associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS infection, while 50% reported associations with ARF/RHD. Crowding was the most frequently assessed factor (14 studies with GAS infection, 36 studies with ARF/RHD), followed by socioeconomic status (6 and 36 studies, respectively). The majority of studies assessing crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, and employment status of parents or cases, and nutrition reported a positive association with risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD.

    Implications: The findings suggest that crowding and socioeconomic status are causal factors in GAS infection and ARF/RHD, providing a practical target for prevention actions. However, the literature examining the role of social determinants in GAS infection, ARF, and RHD risk lacks quality, with most studies being observational and not interventional.

    Conclusions: This systematic review is the most extensive review to date targeting observational and experimental studies in the area of social determinants of health and GAS infection, ARF, and RHD. The results highlight the importance of addressing social determinants, particularly crowding and socioeconomic status, to prevent GAS infection and ARF/RHD. Further research is needed to develop effective interventions targeting these factors and to improve the quality of studies in this area.
Title: Emergence of Bistability in the PhoQ/PhoP Bacterial Signaling Network through a Single Point Mutation

    Abstract:
    The PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network, a prototypical two-component system, exhibits remarkable versatility in response to a single point mutation. We investigated the effects of a phosphatase-deficient mutation in the sensor kinase PhoQ (T281R) on the network's behavior. Our results show that this mutation leads to a bistable response to stimulus, characterized by morphologically distinct ON and OFF states that are inherited over multiple generations. Mathematical modeling and experiments suggest that positive autoregulation of the key proteins PhoP and PhoQ is responsible for this bistability. Notably, the bistable phenotype comes at a substantial fitness cost, with the ON state having a lower fitness than the OFF state in stationary phase cultures. However, the high inheritance of the ON state can lead to epigenetic trapping of a population in a low-fitness state. Our findings highlight the tradeoffs associated with the PhoQ/PhoP system and underscore the importance of understanding the architectural features of two-component systems that enable the emergence of novel properties through few mutations.

    Research Question:
    How does a single point mutation in the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network lead to a bistable response to stimulus?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate the effects of the phosphatase-deficient mutation in PhoQ (T281R) on the PhoQ/PhoP network. Experiments were performed using Escherichia coli cells, and mathematical modeling was used to simulate the behavior of the network.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the phosphatase-deficient mutation in PhoQ (T281R) leads to a bistable response to stimulus, characterized by morphologically distinct ON and OFF states that are inherited over multiple generations. Mathematical modeling suggests that positive autoregulation of PhoP and PhoQ is responsible for this bistability. The bistable phenotype comes at a substantial fitness cost, with the ON state having a lower fitness than the OFF state in stationary phase cultures.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the versatility of the PhoQ/PhoP system and the importance of understanding the architectural features of two-component systems that enable the emergence of novel properties through few mutations. The results also underscore the tradeoffs associated with the PhoQ/PhoP system, including the potential for epigenetic trapping of a population in a low-fitness state.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates the remarkable versatility of the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network and highlights the importance of understanding the architectural features of two-component systems that enable the emergence of novel properties through few mutations. The results have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bacterial signaling networks and the potential for bistability in other two-component systems.

    **Title:** Repurposing Anti-Fungal Drugs for the Treatment of Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) Caused by Naegleria fowleri

    **Research Question:** Can anti-fungal azole drugs be repurposed for the treatment of Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri?

    **Methods:** We systematically assessed the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs on sterol biosynthesis and viability of cultured N. fowleri trophozoites. We identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate by mass spectrometry analysis of N. fowleri lipids and analyzed the interactions between the recombinant CYP51 target and conazoles by UV-vis spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography.

    **Main Findings:** Our studies validated CYP51 as a potentially ‘druggable’ target in N. fowleri and conazole drugs as candidates for assessment in the animal model of PAM. We found that fluconazole and miconazole, known anti-fungal azole drugs, deplete the ergosterol pool by blocking the removal of the methyl group at the C-14 position of a biosynthetic precursor catalyzed by sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51).

    **Implications:** The similarity of targets between N. fowleri and fungal pathogens raises the possibility of repurposing anti-mycotic drugs for the treatment of PAM. Our findings suggest that conazole drugs, such as fluconazole and miconazole, may be effective against N. fowleri and warrant further investigation in the animal model of PAM.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a foundation for the repurposing of anti-fungal azole drugs for the treatment of PAM. The validation of CYP51 as a druggable target in N. fowleri and the identification of conazole drugs as potential candidates for PAM therapy offer new avenues for the development of effective treatments for this devastating infection. Further research is needed to optimize the use of these drugs in the treatment of PAM.

    **Title:** Sustained IL-4Rα Signaling is Required for Maintenance of Anti-Nematode Type 2 Immune Responses

    **Research Question:** What is the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) in maintaining type 2 immune responses against parasitic nematodes after polarization?

    **Methods:** We used a recently established strain of rosaCreERT2-/+IL-4Rα-/Lox mice, where the il4rα gene deletion can be temporally controlled, to investigate the role of IL-4Rα in maintaining type 2 immune responses against Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our study demonstrates that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following interruption after polarization with N. brasiliensis primary infection. Moreover, we show that temporal deletion of IL-4Rα prior to secondary infection with N. brasiliensis drives more efficient recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of the parasites.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that IL-4Rα mediated signaling plays a crucial role in maintaining anti-nematode type 2 immune responses, which is distinct from its established role in immune polarization. Our results highlight the importance of sustained IL-4Rα expression in maintaining optimal type 2 immune responses and recall of host protective memory responses.

    **Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel function for IL-4Rα in the maintenance of anti-nematode type 2 immune responses, which is essential for host protection against parasitic nematodes. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of protective immunity against nematodes and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against parasitic nematode infections. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between the host and nematode parasites, and highlights the importance of IL-4Rα mediated signaling in the maintenance of anti-nematode type 2 immune responses.

    **Title:** Investigating the Evolutionary History and Host Switching Patterns of Bartonella: Implications for Zoonotic Disease Transmission

    **Research Question:** How has the Bartonella genus evolved and switched hosts in the past, and what are the current patterns of transmission and potential mechanisms for future cross-species transmission?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes assembled to date, including 67 new genotypes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Bartonella and identify patterns of host switching and geographic constraint. We used phylogenetic inference to examine the relationships between Bartonella genotypes and their hosts, including humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.

    **Main Findings:** Our results suggest that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as the reservoirs or key proximate hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. We also found evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that at least some part of the noted host specificity of Bartonella is due to ecological factors regulating exposure rather than immunological incompatibility.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the impacts of humans on patterns of infectious disease spread within species and between species, across landscapes and across the globe. The diversity of sources of zoonotic strains, including divergent strains with similar clinical presentations, highlights the need for physicians and researchers to consider a broad range of potential animal hosts and screen for a wide range of Bartonella genotypes when investigating the source of a suspected Bartonella infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the evolutionary history and host switching patterns of Bartonella, a pathogenic genus that is prevalent in mammals and causes numerous human infections. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding the complex relationships between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife in the context of zoonotic disease transmission, and highlight the need for caution in avoiding contact between these groups to protect the health of all.

    **Title:** MALAT1 Regulates Cell Cycle Progression by Modulating Gene Expression and Pre-mRNA Processing

    **Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism by which the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation in cancer tissues?

    **Methods:** Genome-wide transcriptome analyses were performed in normal human diploid fibroblasts to investigate the role of MALAT1 in regulating cell cycle progression. MALAT1 levels were depleted using RNA interference, and the effects on cell cycle gene expression and pre-mRNA processing were examined.

    **Main Findings:** MALAT1 was found to modulate the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 led to the activation of p53 and its target genes, indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity. Furthermore, MALAT1-depleted cells displayed reduced expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing.

    **Implications:** These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation. MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. Abnormal expression of MALAT1 in specific cell types or tissues may result in aberrant alternative splicing leading to misexpression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and/or cell death, thereby contributing to tumor progression.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that MALAT1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression by modulating gene expression and pre-mRNA processing. The findings suggest that MALAT1 is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and that its dysregulation may contribute to cancer development. The identification of MALAT1 as a regulator of cell cycle progression provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and highlights the potential of MALAT1 as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

    **Title:** Juvenile Hormone Regulates DNA Replication and Polyploidy for Vitellogenesis and Oocyte Maturation through the Methoprene-Tolerant Receptor

    **Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of juvenile hormone (JH) action in promoting adult reproduction, specifically vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation, in migratory locusts?

    **Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to phenocopy a JH-deprived condition in migratory locusts and investigated the role of the JH receptor, Methoprene-tolerant (Met), in JH-dependent polyploidy and vitellogenesis. We cloned locust Met cDNA by RACE PCR and performed RNAi to evaluate the role of Met in JH-dependent polyploidy and vitellogenesis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis. We found that Mcm4 and Mcm7, two genes in the DNA replication pathway, are expressed in the presence of JH and Met. Depletion of Mcm4 or Mcm7 inhibited de novo DNA synthesis and polyploidization, and resulted in the substantial reduction of vitellogenin mRNA levels as well as severely impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Met directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to upstream consensus sequences with E-box or E-box-like motifs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the JH-receptor complex acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. This study provides new insights into the molecular basis of JH action in promoting adult reproduction and highlights the importance of Mcm4 and Mcm7 in JH-dependent vitellogenesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that JH regulates DNA replication and polyploidy through the Methoprene-tolerant receptor, which acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to facilitate vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation in migratory locusts. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying JH action in promoting adult reproduction and has implications for the development of novel insect control strategies.

    **Title:** Evaluation of Prednisolone Treatment Duration for Recent Nerve Function Impairment in Leprosy Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial

    **Research Question:** What is the optimal duration of prednisolone treatment for restoring and improving nerve function in leprosy patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI)?

    **Methods:** In this multi-centre, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, 868 leprosy patients with recent NFI (<6 months) were allocated to either a 20-week or 32-week prednisolone treatment regimen. Prednisolone was started at 45 or 60 mg/day, depending on body weight, and tapered throughout follow-up. NFI was assessed using voluntary muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at week 78.

    **Main Findings:** The study found that a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. At week 78, 78.1% of patients in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm showed improved or restored nerve function, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.821). Secondary outcomes, including Reaction Severity Scale, SALSA Scale, and Participation Scale, also showed no significant differences between the groups, except for a higher proportion of Serious Adverse Events in the longer treatment arm.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that a 20-week course of prednisolone is the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, after which only a minority of patients may require further individualized treatment.

    **Conclusions:** This randomized controlled trial provides evidence that a 20-week course of prednisolone is as effective as a 32-week course in restoring and improving recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. The results support the use of a shorter treatment duration, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to establish the optimal prednisolone regimen specifically for leprosy patients with NFI.

    **Research Question:** How do the anatomy and physiology of the larynx and vocal tract of male Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) and European Red Deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) relate to their distinct vocalization patterns during the mating season?

    **Methods:** A finite element model of the larynx and a wave propagation model of the vocal tract were developed based on the morphology and biomechanics of the elk and red deer larynges. The models were used to simulate the production of low-frequency roaring calls in red deer and high-frequency bugles in elk.

    **Main Findings:** The results show that low-frequency calls in red deer require low vocal fold strain, but high lung pressure and large glottal flow to achieve sound intensity levels above 70 dB at 10 m distance. In contrast, high-frequency bugles in elk require large muscular effort to strain the vocal ligament and high lung pressure to overcome phonation threshold pressure, but can achieve at least 10 dB more intensity level. Glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated sound power to aerodynamic power at the glottis, is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage of high-pitched signaling.

    **Implications:** The findings suggest that high-pitched vocalizations in elk may serve as honest signals of muscular strength and endurance, while low-frequency calls in red deer may relate to overall body size. The results also highlight the importance of glottal efficiency in the production of high-frequency vocalizations.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the relationship between anatomy, physiology, and vocalization patterns in two closely related cervid species. The results have implications for our understanding of the evolution of vocal communication in mammals and highlight the importance of considering the biomechanics of the larynx and vocal tract in the study of animal communication. Future studies should investigate whether the auditory system of elk is better suited for high-pitch sounds than low-pitch sounds.
Title: Enhancing Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) Analysis by Incorporating Multi-Reads: A Novel Approach for Identifying Transcription Factor Binding Sites in Highly Repetitive Regions

Abstract:
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for mapping transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications. However, the conventional approach of using only uniquely mapping reads (uni-reads) can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. We present a novel method for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads) by allocating them as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, we demonstrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, detects novel peaks not identifiable with uni-reads, and improves peak detection in mappable regions. Our computational experiments reveal that peaks from multi-read analysis exhibit similar characteristics to those identified by uni-reads, except that the majority reside in segmental duplications. We validate a subset of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identify novel target genes of GATA1. These findings establish that multi-reads are crucial for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments.

Methods:
We developed a weighted alignment scheme to allocate multi-reads as fractional counts, allowing for the incorporation of reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome. We applied this approach to human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets and compared the results to those obtained using only uni-reads.

Main Findings:
Our results show that incorporating multi-reads increases sequencing depths by 22% (25%) and 17% (19%) in STAT1 and GATA1 ChIP (input) samples, respectively. We identified novel peaks that are not detectable with uni-reads alone, particularly in highly repetitive and low mappability regions. Our computational experiments revealed that peaks from multi-read analysis exhibit similar characteristics to those identified by uni-reads, except that the majority reside in segmental duplications.

Implications:
Our study highlights the importance of incorporating multi-reads in ChIP-seq analysis, particularly in highly repetitive regions of genomes. By allocating multi-reads as fractional counts, we can increase sequencing depths, detect novel peaks, and improve peak detection in mappable regions.

Conclusions:
Our findings demonstrate that multi-reads are a valuable resource for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes. By incorporating multi-reads into ChIP-seq analysis, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites and chromatin modifications, ultimately leading to a better understanding of gene regulation and its role in disease.

    **Title:** Estimating the Economic Benefits of Meeting the 2020 WHO Targets for Neglected Tropical Diseases

    **Research Question:** What are the economic benefits of meeting the 2020 WHO targets for human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease, which are controlled or eliminated by innovative and intensified disease management (IDM)?

    **Methods:** A systematic literature review was conducted to identify information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs. The data were combined with projections of the number of people suffering from each NTD, country, and year for 2011-2020 and 2021-2030. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to quantify the degree of uncertainty around the base-case impact estimate.

    **Main Findings:** The total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was estimated to be $23.1 billion (95% CI: $15.9-$34.0 billion) in 2011-2020 and $35.9 billion (95% CI: $25.0-$51.9 billion) in 2021-2030. Reduction in OPPs was estimated to be $14 billion (95% CI: $6.7 billion) and $18 billion (95% CI: $10.4 billion) for the same periods.

    **Implications:** Meeting the 2020 WHO targets for IDM-NTDs would result in significant economic benefits, far exceeding the necessary investments by endemic country governments and their development partners. The benefits of achieving the targets are considerable, and these investments represent good value for money in the effort to improve well-being, distribute the world's prosperity more equitably, and reduce inequity.

    **Conclusions:** Based on conservative assumptions and subsequent uncertainty analyses, we estimate that the benefits of achieving the targets are considerable. The economic benefits of meeting the 2020 WHO targets for IDM-NTDs are substantial, and the investments required to achieve these targets represent a good value for money in the effort to improve well-being, reduce inequity, and distribute the world's prosperity more equitably.

    **Title:** Reevaluating the Role of Neuronal Selectivity in Sensory Encoding: A Novel Principle of Stimulus Representation

    **Research Question:** Do neurons with higher selectivity necessarily convey more information about external sensory inputs, or is the amount of information encoded dependent on other factors?

    **Methods:** Using electrophysiological recordings from the auditory cortex, we investigated the relationship between neuronal selectivity and information encoding in response to sound stimuli. We analyzed the responses of single neurons and neural populations across two temporal epochs: the onset response and the sustained response.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to the prevailing theory, our results show that the neural population conveys similar information about sound input across both epochs, despite differences in neuronal selectivity. We found that the amount of information encoded is almost entirely dependent on the total number of population spikes in the read-out window, rather than the selectivity of individual neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior is sufficient to account for this property.

    **Implications:** Our findings challenge the long-held assumption that neurons with higher selectivity carry more information about external sensory inputs. Instead, we propose a novel principle of sensory encoding, where the amount of information encoded is determined by the total number of spikes in the population, rather than the selectivity of individual neurons. This principle may be widely applicable across multiple sensory systems.

    **Conclusions:** Our results have significant implications for our understanding of sensory information processing in the brain. They suggest that the relationship between neuronal selectivity and information encoding is more complex than previously thought, and that other factors, such as population spiking activity, play a crucial role in determining the amount of information encoded. These findings open up new avenues for research into the mechanisms of sensory encoding and may have important implications for the development of more accurate models of brain function.

    **Title:** OX40 Signaling is Critical for Sustaining Anti-Viral T Cell Responses during Chronic Viral Infections

    **Research Question:** What is the role of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 in maintaining anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections?

    **Methods:** We investigated the importance of OX40 signaling in the context of persistent Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) clone 13 infection using OX40-deficient mice.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that OX40 is critically required for the maintenance of anti-viral T cell responses during chronic LCMV infection. Anti-viral T cells express high levels of OX40 in the presence of their cognate antigen, and T cells lacking the OX40 receptor fail to accumulate sufficiently. Moreover, the emergence of T cell-dependent germinal center responses and LCMV-specific antibodies is severely impaired in OX40-deficient mice. Consequently, OX40-deficient mice fail to control LCMV clone 13 infection over time.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of OX40 signaling in sustaining anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections. OX40-deficiency profoundly impacts the anti-viral immune response, underscoring the need for this co-stimulatory molecule in controlling viral replication and preventing viral spreading.

    **Conclusions:** Our study establishes OX40 as a key factor in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence. These findings have important implications for the study of T cell dysfunction in persistent viral infections in humans and suggest that OX40 signaling may be a critical target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections.

    Title: Convergent Evolution of Mechanically Optimal Swimming Patterns in Aquatic Animals

    Background: Convergent evolution refers to the independent evolution of similar traits in different species, such as the wing and camera-type lens eye in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, instances of convergent evolution of locomotory patterns that quantitatively agree with the mechanically optimal solution are rare. This study investigates the convergent evolution of swimming patterns in a diverse group of aquatic animals.

    Methods: We analyzed the swimming patterns of a wide range of aquatic animals, including vertebrates and invertebrates from three different phyla. We measured the length of undulation along an animal’s fin during swimming and divided it by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin length to calculate the optimal specific wavelength (OSW). We found that the OSW is consistently around 20, which maximizes the force generated by the body and swimming speed.

    Main Findings: Our results show that a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. We found that the OSW is a key factor in maximizing swimming speed, and that it is achieved through the regulation of axial elongation and fin elongation. We also found that the number of undulations along the fin can be predicted based on the OSW and mean undulation amplitude.

    Implications: Our study provides evidence for the convergent evolution of mechanically optimal swimming patterns in aquatic animals. We suggest that the regulation of OSW, axial elongation, and fin elongation may reflect the action of common genetic networks, as seen in the case of the electric organ. Our findings have implications for understanding the links between physical principles and biological phenomena, and how evolution converges to the same result or diverges to a wide variety of solutions.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the convergent evolution of mechanically optimal swimming patterns is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic animals. We propose that the OSW is a key factor in maximizing swimming speed, and that it is achieved through the regulation of axial elongation and fin elongation. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of locomotory patterns and highlight the importance of considering the mechanical principles underlying biological phenomena.

**Title:** Distinct and Overlapping Functions of Condensins I and II in Neural Stem Cell Division and Survival

**Research Question:** What are the roles of condensins I and II in neural stem cell (NSC) division and survival during cerebral cortex development?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive genetic study using conditional knockout (cKO) mice to investigate the functions of condensins I and II in NSC divisions during cortical development.

**Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that both condensins I and II are essential for NSC divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condensins leads to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, causing DNA damage and triggering p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condensins I and II lead to slower loss of NSCs, but display distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation was observed more prominently in NSCs depleted of condensin II, whereas mitotic delays were detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Notably, NSCs depleted of condensin II display hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II, but not condensin I, plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that condensins I and II have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, and provide evolutionary insight into the intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes.

**Conclusions:** This study represents the first comprehensive genetic study of condensins in mammals, demonstrating that both condensins I and II are essential for early embryonic development and cortical development in mice. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the distinct and overlapping functions of condensins I and II in NSC divisions and survival, and provide new insights into the mechanisms of chromosome assembly and segregation during development.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Basis of Sex Determination and Sexual Differentiation in the Human Parasite Schistosoma mansoni

    Abstract:

    Background: Schistosomatidae, a family of hermaphroditic trematodes, have evolved gonochorism, where sex is determined by a female heterogametic system. However, phenotypic sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the vertebrate definitive host. The molecular mechanisms triggering sexual differentiation in these species remain unknown.

    Research Question: What are the molecular determinants of sex determination and sexual differentiation in Schistosoma mansoni, and how do they interact with the vertebrate host?

    Methods: We performed a stage- and sex-comparative RNA-seq analysis of the human parasite S. mansoni in five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages, and adults. We detected 7,168 genes differentially expressed between sexes in at least one developmental stage, and 4,065 of them were functionally annotated. Additionally, we analyzed H3K27me3 histone modification using ChIP-Seq before (in cercariae) and after (in adults) the appearance of phenotypic sexual dimorphism.

    Main Findings: Our results show that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of known players of the host-parasite crosstalk, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators. We identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-biased players of the interaction with the vertebrate host, and different dynamics of the H3K27me3 histone mark between sexes as an illustration of sex-biased epigenetic landscapes.

    Implications: Our study provides new insights into the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation in S. mansoni, a pathogenic parasite for humans. The results suggest that the combination of sex-biased transcriptional landscapes, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators could lead to the optimized sexual dimorphism of this parasitic species. This study represents a promising source of therapeutic targets, providing data on the parasite development in interaction with its vertebrate host and new insights into its reproductive function.

    Conclusions: Our work presents a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination and sexual differentiation in S. mansoni. The identification of sex-biased players of the host-parasite interaction and epigenetic regulators provides new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies against this pathogenic parasite. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex interactions between S. mansoni and its vertebrate host.

    Title: Quantifying Annotation Certainty in Large-Scale Curation Efforts: A Probabilistic Modeling Approach

    Research Question: Can we develop a method to quantify the certainty of individual annotations in large-scale curation efforts, allowing for more accurate and reliable data analysis?

    Methods: We propose a probabilistic modeling approach to estimate the confidence of individual annotations, given annotator-specific parameters estimated from data. We developed two alternative models and compared their performance using computer simulations and a large dataset of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts, with a 1,000-sentence subset further annotated by five new experts.

    Main Findings: Our approach allows for the computation of certainty levels for individual annotations, even in the worst-case scenario where all annotators disagree. We demonstrate that our method significantly increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation, making it a valuable tool for large-scale curation efforts.

    Implications: This study addresses the limitations of existing curation approaches by providing a holistic method for quantifying annotation certainty. By retaining the complete dataset as a basis for training and testing machine learning methods, our approach enables more accurate and reliable data analysis. Furthermore, our methodology can be applied to most data annotation studies, making it a valuable resource for the scientific community.

    Conclusions: Our probabilistic modeling approach provides a novel solution for quantifying annotation certainty in large-scale curation efforts. By estimating annotator-specific parameters and computing certainty levels for individual annotations, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of data analysis. This study highlights the importance of careful experimental design and appropriate modeling in curation efforts, and provides a publicly available corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated according to several cardinal dimensions. Our approach has the potential to benefit curation teams by enabling them to assign confidence to data annotated by a single expert with a known correctness rate, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable scientific conclusions.

    **Title:** Development of a DNA Vaccine-Goose Platform for Production of Antiviral Biologics against Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)

    **Research Question:** Can a DNA vaccine-goose platform be used to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, against Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), a lethal disease caused by Andes virus (ANDV) in South America?

    **Methods:** Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins. The geese developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination, which were maintained at high levels for over 1 year. A booster vaccination resulted in extraordinarily high levels of neutralizing antibodies. IgY and IgYΔFc, the antibodies produced by geese, were purified from egg yolks and analyzed for their reactivity to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins.

    **Main Findings:** The purified IgY and IgYΔFc antibodies were highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. In a hamster model of lethal HPS, passive transfer of α-ANDV immune sera or IgY/IgYΔFc purified from eggs protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively, from lethal disease. In contrast, all hamsters receiving IgY/IgYΔFc purified from normal geese or no treatment developed lethal HPS.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate that the DNA vaccine-goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure. This approach offers an alternative to using human convalescent sera or mammalian antibodies, which are in short supply or have risks of reactogenicity in humans.

    **Conclusions:** The DNA vaccine-goose platform has the potential to produce large quantities of antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, against HPS. The purified IgY and IgYΔFc antibodies from geese vaccinated with the ANDV DNA vaccine are highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins and can protect hamsters from lethal HPS when administered post-exposure. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach in humans.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Dnmt3a in Maintaining DNA Methylation Patterns in Cancer: A Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Study

    Abstract:
    The etiology of human cancers is intricately linked to changes in genomic DNA methylation patterns. The Dnmt3a enzyme plays a crucial role in establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dnmt3a have been implicated in leukemias. We investigated the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in a K-ras–dependent mouse lung cancer model. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the methylomes from Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. Our results reveal profound global methylation changes in K-ras–induced lung cancer, with Dnmt3a wildtype tumors exhibiting large hypomethylated domains corresponding to nuclear lamina-associated domains. In contrast, Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains, and Dnmt3a-deficient tumors exhibit moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. These findings uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes and define the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in a K-ras–dependent mouse lung cancer model?

    Methods:
    We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to comprehensively characterize the methylomes from Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors exhibit large hypomethylated domains corresponding to nuclear lamina-associated domains, while Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains, and Dnmt3a-deficient tumors exhibit moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains.

    Implications:
    These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer. Our results suggest that Dnmt3a acts as a tumor suppressor gene by stabilizing DNA methylation patterns, and that its deletion promotes tumor progression.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer. Our findings highlight the importance of Dnmt3a in stabilizing DNA methylation patterns and preventing tumor progression. These results have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting Dnmt3a in cancer treatment.
Title: Spatial and Temporal Organization of Premotor Cortical Microcircuitry in Songbirds Reveals a Mesoscopic Dynamical Pattern Underlying Neural Sequence Generation

     Abstract:
     Research Question: What is the spatial and temporal organization of premotor cortical microcircuitry in songbirds, and how does it contribute to the generation of neural sequences controlling song?

     Methods: We employed multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging in singing birds to investigate the spatial and temporal organization of premotor cortical activity in the HVC area.

     Main Findings: Our results show that premotor cortical activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, with a length scale of 100 µm. Within this length scale, basal-ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz network rhythm. We also found that activity patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are spatially clustered, with HVCX projection neurons and HVC interneurons firing in alternating phases of a local 30 Hz rhythm.

     Implications: Our findings suggest that the spatial clustering and 30 Hz rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells may be a recurring feature of cortical motor microcircuits and critical for the sequential organization of behavior. These results have implications for studies of songbird vocal learning, suggesting that future biophysical models of motor sequence generation in HVC should consider the interplay of spatially correlated patterns of excitation and inhibition.

     Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the spatial and temporal organization of premotor cortical microcircuitry in songbirds, revealing a mesoscopic dynamical pattern that underlies the generation of neural sequences controlling song. These findings highlight the importance of considering the interplay of spatially correlated patterns of excitation and inhibition in models of motor sequence generation, and have significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.

    **Title:** Evolutionarily Conserved Mechanisms of Aging: Identification of Essential Genes that Regulate Longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** Do genes essential for growth and development in Caenorhabditis elegans also play a role in regulating longevity, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen of 2,700 genes essential for C. elegans development and identified 64 genes that extend lifespan when inactivated post-developmentally.

    **Main Findings:** The 64 candidate lifespan regulators are highly conserved from yeast to humans and can be classified into functional groups, including insulin and metabolic pathways, translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Many of these essential gene inactivations extend lifespan as much as the strongest known regulators of aging. Notably, early gene inactivation of these essential genes causes growth arrest at larval stages, and some of these arrested animals live longer than wild-type adults.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that insulin-signaling pathways play a role in regulating aging at any stage in life, and that the increased longevity is a physiological response to the essential gene inactivation. This is supported by the finding that daf-16 is required for the enhanced survival of arrested larvae.

    **Conclusions:** Our study identifies a set of evolutionarily conserved genes that regulate longevity in C. elegans and highlights the importance of insulin-signaling pathways in aging. These findings have implications for understanding the regulation of aging in other species, including humans, and suggest that targeting these pathways may be a viable strategy for promoting healthy aging. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the utility of using RNAi screens to identify genes that regulate post-developmental phenotypes, such as aging, and highlight the need to uncouple developmental and aging phenotypes when assessing the role of essential genes in longevity.
Title: Identification of Laminin Beta 1a as a Critical Regulator of Epithelial Polarization and Regeneration in Zebrafish Fins

    Abstract:
    During the initial stages of appendage regeneration in salamanders and teleosts, the formation of a specialized epidermis is crucial for instructing growth from the underlying stump tissue. We conducted a forward genetic screen to identify mutations that impair this process in amputated zebrafish fins and identified a temperature-sensitive allele of the ECM component laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) that blocks fin regeneration. Our results reveal that lamb1a, but not its paralog lamb1b, is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This process facilitates the expression of morphogenetic factors such as shha and lef1, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1r, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. In contrast, lamb1a function is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. Furthermore, we show that Fgf20a mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lamb1a expression, linking a central growth factor to epithelial maturation during regeneration. Our findings highlight the transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells as a key, growth factor-guided step in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis.

    Methods:
    We performed a forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify mutations that impair fin regeneration. Positional cloning and complementation assays were used to identify a temperature-sensitive allele of lamb1a that blocks fin regeneration. We analyzed the expression of lamb1a and its paralog lamb1b in epithelial cells after fin amputation and examined the effects of Fgf20a mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition on lamb1a expression.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that lamb1a is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This process facilitates the expression of morphogenetic factors such as shha and lef1, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1r, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. In contrast, lamb1a function is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts.

    Implications:
    Our findings highlight the critical role of lamb1a in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis during zebrafish fin regeneration. The transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells is a key step in the regeneration process, and its function is dependent on Fgf signaling. Our results also suggest that the regeneration epidermis is shaped by a network of growth factor-ECM regulatory interactions.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study identifies lamb1a as a critical regulator of epithelial polarization and regeneration in zebrafish fins. The transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells is a key step in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis, and its function is dependent on Fgf signaling. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of appendage regeneration and highlight the importance of ECM components in the regeneration process.

    **Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Linear Mixed Model Approaches for Genome-Wide Association Studies

    **Research Question:** How do different linear mixed model (LMM) approaches and software implementations perform in modeling population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)?

    **Methods:** We compared the performance of six LMM approaches (EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM) and three alternative approaches (MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MASTOR) on a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all are successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied naively to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. We also found high correlation between LMMs and alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches, making them a convenient and robust choice for family-based GWAS of quantitative or binary traits. However, the choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, rather than power or type I error considerations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of LMM approaches in controlling the genome-wide error rate and offers higher power than traditional family-based association analysis approaches. The strong concordance between LMM results and alternative approaches suggests that LMMs can be a reliable choice for GWAS analysis. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of careful consideration of user-chosen options, such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship matrix, to ensure optimal performance of LMM approaches.

    Title: Identification of Novel Compounds with High Efficacy against Trypanosoma cruzi: Implications for Chagas Disease Treatment

    Background: Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in the Americas, with no effective treatment available for the chronic stage. Current medications have toxic side effects and are only effective against the acute phase of the disease.

    Research Question: Can a high-throughput screening (HTS) approach be used to identify novel compounds with high efficacy against T. cruzi, particularly against the chronic stage of the disease?

    Methods: A whole cell-based assay was optimized for HTS of compounds against T. cruzi trypomastigotes. A 2000-compound chemical library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi (Tulahuen strain) expressing β-galactosidase. Three hits, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, were selected for their high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells in vitro.

    Main Findings: Each of the three compounds presented a different mechanism of action on intracellular proliferation of T. cruzi amastigotes. CX1 showed strong trypanocidal activity, essential for treating the chronic stage of Chagas disease. NT1 had a trypanostatic effect, while PCH1 affected parasite division. The compounds also showed high activity against intracellular T. cruzi from the Y strain and against related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis.

    Implications: These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. The IC50 values of PCH6 and CX2 (2 nM) are approximately 100 times lower than those of current medicines used against T. cruzi.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a HTS approach in identifying novel compounds with high efficacy against T. cruzi. The selected compounds have the potential to be developed into therapeutic agents against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Further studies are needed to determine their toxicity in animals and efficacy in vivo to assess their potential as therapeutic agents.
Title: Development of a Novel Diagnostic Platform for Molecular Xenomonitoring of Filarial Parasites in Mosquito Vectors: A Proof-of-Concept for Backpack PCR

    Abstract:

    Background: Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) efforts for lymphatic filariasis rely heavily on PCR-based detection of Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti in mosquito vectors. However, traditional DNA extraction methods using silica column-based technologies are time-consuming, costly, and require expensive thermal cyclers or real-time PCR instruments, posing significant challenges for laboratories in endemic areas.

    Research Question: Can a novel diagnostic approach using a rapid, NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology coupled with a portable, battery-powered PCR platform and a test strip-based DNA detection assay improve the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring in B. malayi-endemic locations?

    Methods: We evaluated the performance of a rapid, NaOH-based DNA extraction method for extracting total DNA from pools of parasite-spiked vector mosquitoes and compared it to standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques. We also compared our novel test strip-based detection assay to real-time PCR and conventional PCR coupled with gel electrophoresis, demonstrating sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA from extracted mosquito pools.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the NaOH-based DNA extraction method is as effective as silica column-based methods, and the test strip-based detection assay is comparable to real-time PCR and conventional PCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential for point-of-collection-based use of the entire diagnostic platform, which is compact enough to fit into a small backpack.

    Implications: This novel diagnostic platform, termed "Backpack PCR," eliminates reliance on expensive and bulky instrumentation without compromising sensitivity or specificity of detection, providing an alternative to cost-prohibitive column-dependent DNA extractions. This field-ready system increases the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring within B. malayi-endemic locations and provides a proof-of-concept framework for the development of a parallel assay for the detection of W. bancrofti.

    Conclusions: The coupling of a simple DNA extraction method with a field-friendly amplification platform and test strip-based detection technology has the potential to greatly expand the reach of MX efforts. The development of a similar "Backpack PCR"-based assay for W. bancrofti, the parasite responsible for approximately 90% of the global LF burden, would be of significant use to the research community, and efforts to create such a platform are currently underway. This method could also be extended to the detection of pathogens causing other mosquito-borne infections, such as malaria, Zika, dengue fever, Chikungunya, and others.

    **Title:** Investigating the Impact of Domain Architecture on the Self-Assembly and Structural Integrity of Elastomeric Proteins

    **Research Question:** How do variations in the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains influence the morphology and structural integrity of elastomeric proteins?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel simulation environment using a diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating domain architectures. The model was applied to various domain architectures, and the resulting aggregates were analyzed using graph-theoretic metrics to predict their structural integrity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the resultant polymeric structure. Specifically, the most highly connected polymers were those constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains.

    **Implications:** These findings provide insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins, which have evolved independently multiple times through evolution. The results also suggest that the relative size of elastomeric and cross-linking domains may have a profound influence on the ability of these molecules to correctly align their cross-linking domains and stabilize the resulting polymeric matrix.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of domain architecture in determining the self-assembly and structural integrity of elastomeric proteins. The simulation environment developed in this study may be valuable for the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides with tunable properties, which could be exploited as useful biomaterials. Furthermore, this work provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins, shedding light on the complex relationships between elastomeric domains and cross-linking domains that drive self-assembly and structural integrity.

    Title: Elucidating the Role of Zaire Ebolavirus 5′-Untranslated Regions in Translation Regulation and Virus Replication

    Background: Ebolaviruses, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The seven viral transcriptional units of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) contain long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), which have not been assigned specific functions.

    Research Question: What is the role of EBOV 5′-UTRs in translation regulation and virus replication?

    Methods: We used reporter assays to investigate the function of EBOV 5′-UTRs in translation regulation. We demonstrated that the 5′-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) function but differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene.

    Main Findings: We found that the 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR contains four upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary open reading frame (pORF). The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation and was surrounded by a "weak" Kozak sequence, which suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions of eIF2α phosphorylation, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress.

    Implications: Mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein-coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin.

    Conclusions: Our data identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication, and identify a potential therapeutic target. The EBOV 5′-UTRs do not function as IRESes but regulate cap-dependent translation, and the L uAUG modulates translation in response to cellular stress. These findings provide new insights into the biology of EBOV and highlight the importance of the L uAUG in virus replication.

    **Title:** Genome-Wide Mapping of DNA Double-Strand Breaks Reveals Novel Gene Regulation Mechanisms

    **Research Question:** How do DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) contribute to genome instability and gene regulation in human chromosomes?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes using deep-sequencing data. This approach allowed us to identify non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots scattered along chromosomes, which delimit protected 50–250 kb DNA domains.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that about 30% of these domains, denoted as "forum domains," possess coordinately expressed genes. Furthermore, we found that PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the forum domain termini. These findings suggest a novel type of gene regulation, where DSB hot spots and PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites delimit gene clusters that undergo coordinated transcription or silencing.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the relationship between human chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation. The identification of DSB hot spots and PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites may have significant implications for understanding cancer genomics and gene therapy. The binding of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 at these sites may influence coordinated transcription within forum domains, suggesting a novel mechanism of gene regulation.

    **Conclusions:** Our research provides evidence for a novel type of gene regulation, where DSB hot spots and PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites delimit gene clusters that undergo coordinated transcription or silencing. These findings have important implications for understanding the relationship between genome instability, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, and may lead to new insights into cancer genomics and gene therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic role of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 in this novel gene regulation mechanism.

    **Title:** Trypanosomatid Infection in Bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro State: A Comparative Study of Two Areas with Different Levels of Preservation

    **Research Question:** Do the levels of preservation and connectivity in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state influence the diversity of trypanosomatids in bats?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comparative study of trypanosomatid infection in bats from two areas with different levels of preservation and connectivity in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state: Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (REGUA) and Estação Fiocruz Mata Atlântica (EFMA). We analyzed 181 bat specimens by LIT/Schneider hemoculture and molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18 SSU rRNA-encoding gene fragment.

    **Main Findings:** Our results showed no significant influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness, with similar chiropterofauna and higher abundance of two common fruit-eating bat species, Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Trypanosomatid infection rates were similar in both areas, with 15% in REGUA and 11% in EFMA (p = 0.46). Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp. in Neotropical phyllostomid bats. Mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed.

    **Implications:** Our study highlights the high diversity of trypanosomatids in bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, maintaining trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment. The detection of Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas, reinforces the urgency of discussing the concepts of parasitism and hosts among trypanosomatids.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides an overview of trypanosomatid diversity in bats from two areas with different levels of human disturbance. The high diversity of trypanosomatid species and/or genotypes isolated from blood cultures suggests that bats are extremely resilient to infection by trypanosomatids and can be sources of infection to vectors, maintaining a high diversity of these parasites. Our findings emphasize the importance of including parasites that can potentially infect humans in studies of local biodiversity, particularly in areas with high human population density, such as the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state.

Title: High Prevalence of Pathogen Co-infections in Ixodes ricinus Ticks: Implications for Human and Animal Health

Background: Ixodes ricinus ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, capable of transmitting a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence of co-infections in ticks, which can have significant implications for human and animal health.

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of 38 pathogens and four symbionts in Ixodes ricinus ticks from the French Ardennes, and to investigate possible interactions between pathogens and symbionts.

Methods: A total of 267 female Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected and analyzed using high-throughput real-time PCR, rRT-PCR, and nested PCR to detect the presence of 37 pathogens and four symbionts. Possible interactions between pathogens and symbionts were statistically evaluated.

Main Findings: The results showed that 45% of the ticks were co-infected with up to five different pathogens, and when including symbionts, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism, with up to eight microorganisms identified in the same tick. Notably, a strong association was found between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, but no significant interactions were observed between symbionts and pathogens.

Implications: The high prevalence of pathogen co-infections in ticks raises concerns about the potential for co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals, with significant consequences for human and animal health. The study also highlights the importance of considering symbionts in the context of tick-borne diseases, as they may play a role in pathogen maintenance and transmission.

Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological situation of tick-borne pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks from the French Ardennes, and highlights the need for further research into the interactions between pathogens and symbionts. The findings have important implications for the development of strategies to prevent and control tick-borne diseases in Europe.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Circuitry of Hematopoietic Lineage Commitment: A Computational Model of the PU.1-GATA-1 Switch

    **Research Question:** How do genetic networks govern the primed and committed states of hematopoietic stem cells, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational model of the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, focusing on the genetic switch involving the master genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Our model incorporates known interactions between these genes, including mutual antagonism and autoregulation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that dynamical models based on these interactions fail to exhibit bistability, a crucial feature for robust lineage determination. To address this, we proposed a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated and recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner, enabling bistability and switch-like behavior. Our model predicts that suppression of the cofactor can lead to a loss of cooperativity, resulting in a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1.

    **Implications:** The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and reinforces the decision through feedback loops, leading to irreversible commitment. Our findings suggest that regulating cooperativity through cofactor recruitment is a key mechanism for implementing both primed and committed states in genetic networks.

    **Conclusions:** Our computational model provides a framework for understanding the molecular circuitry of hematopoietic lineage commitment. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch serves as an example of a network that regulates cooperativity through cofactor recruitment, enabling both primed and committed states. This approach has implications for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid in the search for lineage-determining genes. Future work should explore the effects of noise on these interactions and investigate how irreversibility of the erythroid-myeloid lineage switch can be achieved through feedback from other lineage components.
Title: Elucidating the Role of Enterococcal Polysaccharide Antigen (EPA) Decoration in Enterococcus faecalis Resistance to Lysozyme and Virulence

    Abstract:
    Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen, exhibits intrinsic resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. This resistance is mediated by a complex network of transcriptional regulators and genes, including oatA, pgdA, dltA, and sigV. To identify novel genes modulating E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme, we employed random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oatA/pgdA/dltA/sigV mutant. This approach led to the identification of several independent insertions in the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) variable region, located downstream of the conserved epaA-epaR genes. Our results demonstrate that EPA decoration contributes to resistance towards charged antimicrobials and underpins virulence in the zebrafish model of infection by conferring resistance to phagocytosis. Furthermore, we show that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections, revealing an essential role of the modification of this surface polymer for enterococcal pathogenesis.

    Methods:
    We employed random transposon mutagenesis in the quadruple oatA/pgdA/dltA/sigV mutant to identify novel genes involved in E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme. We used the OG1RF strain as the parental strain, which is virulent in the zebrafish model of infection. Mapping of transposon insertion sites revealed that 9 out of 16 mutants had insertions downstream of the conserved epaA-epaR region, which encodes the core synthetic apparatus for EPA production.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the EPA variable region, previously proposed to be responsible for EPA decorations, plays a crucial role in E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme and virulence. The decoration of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is essential for resistance to charged antimicrobials and phagocytosis in the zebrafish model of infection.

    Implications:
    These findings have significant implications for our understanding of E. faecalis pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this opportunistic pathogen. The identification of the EPA variable region as a key regulator of lysozyme resistance and virulence highlights the importance of surface polysaccharide modifications in bacterial pathogenesis.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the decoration of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is essential for E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme and virulence. The identification of the EPA variable region as a key regulator of lysozyme resistance and virulence provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying E. faecalis pathogenesis and highlights the importance of surface polysaccharide modifications in bacterial pathogenesis.

    Title: RACER: A Novel Framework for Integrating ENCODE and TCGA Data to Reveal Acute Myeloid Leukemia-Specific Regulatory Programs

    Background: Gene expression is a complex function of multiple genetic and epigenetic factors, including copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation (DM), transcription factor (TF) occupancy, and microRNA (miRNA) post-transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in microarray and sequencing technologies have generated large amounts of genome-wide data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, there is a lack of an integrative model to fully leverage these rich yet heterogeneous data.

    Research Question: Can we develop a novel framework to integrate ENCODE and TCGA data to reveal Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)-specific regulatory programs?

    Methods: We developed RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation), a two-stage regression framework that integrates TF data from ENCODE, CNV, DM, and miRNA expression signals from TCGA. RACER first infers sample-specific regulatory activities by TFs and miRNAs, which are then used as inputs to infer specific TF/miRNA-gene interactions.

    Main Findings: We applied RACER to AML data from TCGA and related TF binding data measured in K562 from ENCODE. Our model demonstrated superior statistical power in detecting known miRNA/TF targets and identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered consistently with cytogenetic risk groups. One of the selected regulators, miR-548p, was found to have inferred targets significantly enriched for leukemia-related pathways, implicating its novel role in AML pathogenesis. Additionally, survival analysis using the inferred activities identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker.

    Implications: RACER provides a novel framework for integrating ENCODE and TCGA data to reveal AML-specific regulatory programs at a global level. Our results highlight the importance of considering TF regulations in miRNA-gene interactions and demonstrate the potential of RACER in identifying novel regulators and prognostic markers for AML.

    Conclusions: RACER is a powerful tool for integrating heterogeneous data from ENCODE and TCGA to reveal complex regulatory programs in cancer. Our study demonstrates the potential of RACER in identifying novel regulators and prognostic markers for AML, and highlights the importance of considering TF regulations in miRNA-gene interactions.
Title: Elucidating the Role of RNA Silencing in the Fungal Pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum: Unveiling an Antiviral Mechanism

    Abstract:

    Background: Despite the vast diversity of fungal species, the biological roles of RNA silencing in fungi remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the function of RNA silencing in the ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum, a pathogen that affects a wide range of crops worldwide.

    Methods: We generated knock-out mutants affecting genes for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), two Dicer-like (DCL), and two Argonaute (AGO) proteins in C. higginsianum using targeted gene replacement. We analyzed the effects of these mutations on vegetative growth, conidiation, and conidia morphology, as well as total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations in parental and mutant strains.

    Main Findings: Our results showed that Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2 double mutant, and Δago1 strains exhibited severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations were significantly affected in these mutant strains, with a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 (ChNRV1), being derepressed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relationship between ChNRV1 and members of the segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 showed abundant loading of 5’U-containing viral siRNA.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum functions as an antiviral mechanism to maintain low levels of accumulation of ChNRV1. The deletion mutant analysis revealed that DCL1 and AGO1 are critical for maintaining conidia production and asexual spore morphology in C. higginsianum.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the role of RNA silencing in the fungal pathogen C. higginsianum and highlights the importance of DCL1 and AGO1 in maintaining conidia production and asexual spore morphology. The discovery of ChNRV1 and its relationship to the Partitiviridae family expands our understanding of fungal viruses and their interactions with their hosts. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel strategies to control fungal diseases in crops.

    Title: MOF Facilitates Three Waves of H2AX Phosphorylation Expansion in Male Meiotic Prophase I

    Research Question: What is the role of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF in the three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion during male meiotic prophase I?

    Methods: Germ cell-specific deletion of Mof in spermatocytes using Stra8-Cre (Mof cKO) was performed to investigate the role of MOF in H2AX phosphorylation expansion. Immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy were used to analyze γH2AX signals and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation in leptotene, zygotene, and pachytene spermatocytes.

    Main Findings: Our study reveals that MOF is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively. In Mof cKO spermatocytes, γH2AX signals were observed only along the chromosomal axes in leptotene and zygotene stages, and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation was lost. In early-mid pachytene spermatocytes, γH2AX and MDC1 were detected along the unsynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes, but failed to expand, leading to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) failure. Furthermore, defects in double-strand break (DSB) repair and crossover formation were observed in Mof cKO spermatocytes, indicating that MOF facilitates meiotic DSB repair after RAD51 recruitment.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that MOF plays a crucial role in regulating male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation. The loss of MOF function disrupts chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation expansion, leading to MSCI failure and defects in DSB repair and crossover formation.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that MOF is essential for the expansion of H2AX phosphorylation from leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively. We propose that MOF regulates male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and DSB repair, and highlight the importance of MOF in regulating male meiosis.

    Title: Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) Infection Alters Early Haematopoietic Development in a Human Immune System (HIS) Rag2-/-γc-/- Mouse Model

    Background: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus associated with the onset of immature leukemias and lymphomas. Previous studies have shown that HTLV-1 interferes with β-selection, a critical checkpoint of early thymopoiesis, suggesting that HTLV-1 infection can perturb thymic human αβ T-cell development.

    Research Question: To investigate the in vivo effects of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development in a Human Immune System (HIS) Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model.

    Methods: HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mice were infected with HTLV-1 at a time when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes have been detected. The proviral load was measured, and alterations in human T-cell development were assessed in the thymus and spleen.

    Main Findings: In all but two inoculated mice, the HTLV-1 provirus was found integrated in thymocytes, and the proviral load increased with the length of the infection period. In HTLV-1-infected mice, mature single-positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ cells were most numerous at the expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These SP cells also accumulated in the spleen. Human lymphocytes from thymus and spleen were activated, as shown by the expression of CD25, which was correlated with the presence of tax mRNA and increased expression of NF-kB-dependent genes such as bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic gene.

    Implications: These results demonstrate that HTLV-1 infection alters early haematopoietic development in a Human Immune System (HIS) Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model, leading to the expansion of mature T-cells in the periphery. The findings suggest that Tax activates the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mice and favours the expansion of mature activated T-cells.

    Conclusions: The HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model provides a suitable system for studying the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1. The results suggest that the combination of immature target cells in the thymus and the immunodeficient environment of HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mice favours the rapid development of a T-cell malignancy. This model will be helpful for studying the involvement of other HTLV-1 genes, such as hbz, in viral pathogenesis and the role of proviral integration sites.
Title: Evaluation of an Integrated Control Program for Schistosomiasis in Al Jabalain Locality, White Nile State, Sudan: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract:
Schistosomiasis remains a significant public health concern in Sudan, particularly in the White Nile State, where Schistosoma haematobium infection is prevalent. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an integrated control program implemented by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) in Al Jabalain locality from 2009 to 2011. The program aimed to reduce the prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections among primary school students.

Methods:
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 61 primary schools, with a total of 10,671 urine and 9,107 stool samples collected from students in grades 1, 3, and 5. The urine and stool specimens were examined using the urine sedimentation method and the Kato cellophane thick smear method, respectively. A questionnaire survey was conducted to assess the impact of health education and the provision of a drinking water supply facility at Al Hidaib village.

Main Findings:
The baseline prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced to 13.5% (95% CI = 0.331-0.462). A higher reduction in prevalence was observed among girls, those with moderately infected status (around 20%), and residents in rural areas, compared to boys, those with high prevalence (>40%), and residents in urban areas. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection remained unchanged between baseline and follow-up surveys (95% CI = 0.933-6.891).

Implications:
The study demonstrates the effectiveness of an integrated control program in reducing the prevalence of S. haematobium infection by more than 50% compared to the baseline rate. The provision of clean water supply facilities and health education significantly contributed to the reduction of S. haematobium infection. However, the prevalence of S. mansoni infection remained unchanged, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

Conclusions:
This study highlights the importance of integrated control programs in reducing the prevalence of S. haematobium infection in endemic areas. The provision of clean water supply facilities and health education are crucial components of such programs. To consolidate the achievements of this project, the integrated intervention should be adapted continuously, and targeted interventions should be implemented to control S. mansoni infection.
Title: Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Trafficking of Nipah Virus Matrix Protein Plays a Critical Role in Viral Budding

    Abstract:
    The Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus, causes fatal encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) pathogen. We investigated the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the NiV matrix protein (NiV-M) and its role in viral budding. Our results show that NiV-M translocates to the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and abolished NiV-M budding. We identified a highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS that serves dual functions: mediating nuclear import and regulating nuclear export through monoubiquitination. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding, while depletion of free ubiquitin via proteasome inhibitors resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding. Notably, live NiV budding was exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, with bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, reducing viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM. These findings suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated viral budding. Our results open up the possibility of using an “off-the-shelf” therapeutic, such as bortezomib, against acute NiV infection.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the Nipah virus matrix protein (NiV-M) in viral budding?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of live cell imaging, mutagenesis, and biochemical assays to investigate the trafficking pathway of NiV-M and its role in viral budding.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that NiV-M translocates to the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the NLS and NES in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and abolished NiV-M budding. We identified a highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS that serves dual functions: mediating nuclear import and regulating nuclear export through monoubiquitination. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding, while depletion of free ubiquitin via proteasome inhibitors resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated viral budding. The sensitivity of live NiV budding to proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, opens up the possibility of using an “off-the-shelf” therapeutic against acute NiV infection.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides new insights into the role of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M in viral budding and highlights the potential of proteasome inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy against NiV infection.

    **Title:** Mechanisms of Genome Delivery by Nonenveloped Viruses: A Live-Cell Imaging Study of Poliovirus Entry

    **Research Question:** How do nonenveloped viruses, such as poliovirus (PV), deliver their genomes across the cellular membrane and into the cell?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel imaging assay that simultaneously tracks the viral capsid and genome in live cells, combined with an infectivity-based assay for RNA release, to investigate the early events in PV infection. We probed the effects of inhibitors of cell trafficking pathways on RNA genome delivery using both methods.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that PV genome release is highly efficient and rapid, occurring within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane, and does not limit the overall infectivity or infection rate. We observed that PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell through a clathrin-, caveolin-, flotillin-, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine kinase- and actin-dependent, endocytic mechanism.

    **Implications:** These findings settle a long-standing debate on whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. Our results suggest that PV must first enter the cell before releasing its genome, and that the genome release occurs quickly after internalization.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of genome delivery by nonenveloped viruses, shedding light on the early events in PV infection. The imaging assay used in this study is expected to be broadly applicable to the investigation of entry mechanisms for other nonenveloped viruses. Our findings have significant implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting nonenveloped viruses, which are responsible for a range of human diseases, including poliomyelitis, rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

**Title:** Evaluating the Effectiveness of Health Education in Dengue Fever Prevention and Control in Cambodia

**Background:** Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern in Cambodia, particularly among children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) relies heavily on health education as a means of prevention and control. However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been systematically evaluated.

**Research Question:** What are the approaches used in health education for dengue fever prevention and control in Cambodia, and how effective are they in translating knowledge into practice?

**Methods:** This study draws on data collected in 2003-2004 as part of an ethnographic study in eastern Cambodia. We examined the approaches used in community health education, including health centre outreach activities and campaigns, as well as school-based education.

**Main Findings:** Our findings indicate that community health education is provided irregularly and is under-funded, while school-based education is restricted in terms of time and lacks practical activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence to dengue prevention and control measures is partial.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the need for sustained routine education for dengue prevention and control, as well as the importance of approaches that ensure the translation of knowledge into practice. We suggest that local prevention and control activities, involving community members and supported through health education, offer potential to reduce the prevalence of dengue.

**Conclusions:** The effectiveness of health education in dengue fever prevention and control in Cambodia is compromised by economic, political, and infrastructural factors. To address this gap, we recommend the development of a structured model of change for health outreach activities and health education materials, as well as training in health education techniques for health practitioners. By redefining existing dengue health education messages, materials, and strategies to be practical, applicable, and relevant, we can improve the translation of knowledge into practice and ultimately reduce the burden of dengue fever in Cambodia.

    **Title:** Identification of Circulating MicroRNAs Released by Filarial Nematodes: Implications for Diagnosis and Host-Parasite Interactions

    **Research Question:** Can circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes be detected in the host bloodstream, and can they serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and understanding of host-parasite interactions?

    **Methods:** We employed miRNA deep-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to investigate the presence of nematode-derived miRNAs in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma and Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. We identified over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in D. immitis-infected dog plasma and 21 in O. volvulus-infected human serum.

    **Main Findings:** We developed stem-loop RT-qPCR assays targeting two detected miRNA candidates, miR-71 and miR-34, which discriminated infected samples (both species) from uninfected samples. However, absolute miRNA copy numbers were not significantly correlated with microfilaraemia for either parasite. This may be due to the imprecision of mf counts to estimate infection intensity or to miRNA contributions from the unknown number of adult worms present.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that parasite-derived circulating miRNAs are present in plasma or serum, even for species that do not live in the bloodstream. This has significant implications for the development of novel diagnostic tools and our understanding of host-parasite interactions.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that circulating miRNAs released by filarial nematodes can be detected in the host bloodstream and may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and understanding of host-parasite interactions. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of these miRNAs as diagnostic tools and to elucidate their role in host-parasite interactions.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Conformational Transition Mechanisms of Src Family Tyrosine Kinases

    **Research Question:** How do Src family tyrosine kinases transition from an inactive to an active state, and what are the key structural changes involved in this process?

    **Methods:** We constructed a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain of Src kinase, incorporating experimental structures for the two stable states, and simulated the dynamics of conformational transitions using molecular dynamics simulations. We explored the transition energy landscapes by constructing a structural network among clusters of conformations from the simulations.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal two major ensembles of pathways for the activation of Src kinase. In the first pathway, a coordinated switching mechanism of interactions among the αC helix, the activation-loop, and the β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain is observed. In the second pathway, the conformational change is coupled to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region of the catalytic domain. We also characterized the switching mechanism for the αC helix and the activation-loop in detail.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a broad framework for understanding the main features of the conformational transition taking place upon Src activation. The results suggest that the activation of Src kinase involves a complex interplay of structural changes, including coordinated switching mechanisms and partial unfolding of the N-lobe region. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the regulation of Src kinase activity and its role in cellular signaling pathways.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the conformational transition mechanisms of Src family tyrosine kinases. The use of a coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to explore the transition energy landscapes and identify key structural changes involved in the activation of Src kinase. The results of this study provide a foundation for further research into the regulation of Src kinase activity and its role in various cellular processes.

    **Title:** Unraveling the Molecular Mechanisms of F1 Lethality in Polyploid Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying F1 lethality in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana, and how do they contribute to polyploid speciation?

    **Methods:** We conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study to identify the genetic architecture of maternally expressed variation in F1 lethality in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana. We used a combination of genetic and molecular biology techniques, including QTL mapping, fine mapping, and gene expression analysis.

    **Main Findings:** We identified a single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 (DSL1), which affects the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. We also found that the frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly due to the simple genetic basis of the natural variation and effects of single-gene mutations. The role of the sporophytically active TTG2 gene in interploidy crosses indicates that the developmental programming of the mother regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying F1 lethality in polyploid Arabidopsis thaliana. The identification of the DSL1 QTL and its association with the TTG2 gene highlights the importance of maternal effect genes in regulating the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring. Our findings have implications for our understanding of polyploid speciation and the evolution of reproductive isolation in plants.

    **Title:** Comparative Host-Pathogen Coevolutionary Analyses of Bartonella and Leptospira in Bats and Rodents

    **Research Question:** Do Bartonella and Leptospira exhibit coevolutionary patterns with their bat and rodent hosts, and if so, what are the implications for disease transmission and spillover to humans?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comparative host-pathogen coevolutionary analysis of 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevolutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show significant coevolutionary congruence between Bartonella and both their rodent and bat hosts at a global level (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P ≤ 0.001; m2 global value = 7.3320, P ≤ 0.0001). In contrast, the relationship between Leptospira and their bat hosts was non-significant (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m2 global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Event-based cophylogeny analyses revealed that Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264).

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching in both bat and rodent hosts, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has a high number of host switches. These variable coevolutionary patterns are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology.

    **Conclusions:** Understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow for better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans. Our study highlights the importance of considering host-pathogen coevolution in the context of emerging zoonotic diseases, and underscores the need for further research on the evolutionary dynamics of Bartonella and Leptospira in bat and rodent hosts.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Emergence of Movement in Undulatory Swimming: A Forced Damped Oscillation Framework

    **Research Question:** How do muscle contractions and environmental forces contribute to the complex deformation kinematics and movement of undulatory swimmers?

    **Methods:** A chain-link model of undulatory swimming was employed to investigate the emergence of movement due to muscular and/or environmental forcing. A forced damped oscillation framework was applied to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to validate the results.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is crucial for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. We demonstrate that relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger complex deformation kinematics leading to movement. The results show that the power generated from muscle work is used to create body deformations, which are then dissipated into the surrounding fluid. A closed-form expression for swimming velocity was derived through a leading-order analysis of the equations of motion.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a unified understanding of swimming, encompassing both active (muscle contractions) and passive (environmental forces) swimming. The study highlights the importance of the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator in determining the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. The results also shed light on the optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming.

    **Conclusions:** Our research demonstrates that the forced damped oscillation framework is a powerful tool for understanding the emergence of movement in undulatory swimming. The study provides new insights into the complex interplay between muscle contractions and environmental forces in generating movement. The results have implications for the development of more efficient swimming strategies and the design of biomimetic robots that mimic the movement of undulatory swimmers.

    **Title:** Continuous Generation of Novel Human-Pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei Strains through Genetic Recombination with Animal-Infective Subspecies

    **Research Question:** Can genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals generate new strains of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr), responsible for sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT) in East Africa?

    **Methods:** We investigated the inheritance of the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity in Tbr, in crosses of Tbr and Tbb set up by co-transmitting genetically-engineered fluorescent parental trypanosome lines through tsetse flies. We tracked the transfer of SRA into new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between Tbr and Tbb.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between Tbr and Tbb, creating new strains of the human pathogen Tbr. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of hybrid trypanosomes carrying SRA. We also found that SRA exists as a single copy in a representative collection of Tbr strains and is located on one homologue of chromosome IV in the majority of Tbr isolates examined.

    **Implications:** The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination readily explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa. Our findings suggest that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the much larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes. This has significant implications for the risk of future outbreaks of HAT.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that genetic recombination between Tbr and Tbb can generate new strains of the human pathogen Tbr, which presents a risk for future outbreaks of HAT. The continuous generation of novel recombinants highlights the need for ongoing surveillance and monitoring of Tbr strains in East Africa to mitigate the risk of HAT outbreaks.

**Title:** Gap Junction Coupling Exacerbates Islet Dysfunction in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus: A Computational and Experimental Study

**Research Question:** How does gap junction coupling contribute to islet dysfunction in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM) caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes?

**Methods:** We employed a multi-cellular computational model of islet electrical activity and insulin secretion to investigate the role of gap junction coupling in NDM. We first validated the model against experimental measurements of [Ca2+] and insulin secretion in islets expressing ATP-insensitive KATP channels under different levels of gap junction coupling. We then applied the model to predict how different KATP channel mutations found in NDM suppress [Ca2+] and the role of gap junction coupling in this suppression.

**Main Findings:** Our results show that reductions in gap junction coupling allow progressively greater glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. The model demonstrated good correspondence between suppression of [Ca2+] and clinical presentation of different NDM mutations. Notably, significant recoveries in [Ca2+] and insulin secretion were predicted for many mutations upon reductions in gap junction coupling, where stochastic noise played a significant role in the recoveries.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of islet dysfunction in NDM and suggest that reducing gap junction coupling may recover islet function and blunt diabetes caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8. These results have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic options for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of gap junction coupling in exacerbating the effects of decreased cellular excitability in NDM. Our findings highlight the potential of reducing gap junction coupling as a therapeutic strategy to recover islet function and improve glucose homeostasis in patients with NDM. Further research is needed to examine the role of stochastic noise in β-cells and its link to channel numbers to accurately estimate [Ca2+] increases in the presence of altered KATP kinetics.

    **Title:** Predicting the Dynamic Behavior of Gene Transcription Networks: A Framework for Accounting for Retroactivity

    **Research Question:** Can we develop an analysis framework that accurately predicts the dynamic behavior of a large gene transcription network from the properties of its composing modules, accounting for the phenomenon of retroactivity?

    **Methods:** We introduce a novel framework that explicitly accounts for retroactivity, a context-dependent behavior that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules. Our framework is based on three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters (dissociation constants and promoter concentrations) and the modules' topology.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that our framework can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. We illustrate the implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules.

    **Implications:** Our framework provides a missing piece of knowledge that captures loading effects due to intramodular and intermodular connections. By accounting for retroactivity, we can evaluate the extent of modularity of natural networks and establish concrete design guidelines to minimize retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.

    **Conclusions:** This study addresses a central problem in systems and synthetic biology by providing a framework that predicts the dynamic behavior of gene transcription networks from the properties of their composing modules. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering retroactivity in understanding the behavior of gene transcription networks and highlight the potential of our framework to aid in the design of synthetic biological systems. By accounting for retroactivity, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions within gene transcription networks and develop more accurate models of their behavior.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Obligatory Crossover in the Human Pseudoautosomal Region 1 (PAR1)

    **Research Question:** What is the mechanism of obligatory crossover in the human pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), and how does it contribute to the exceptionally high male crossover rate in this region?

    **Methods:** We constructed a fine-scale genetic map of directly observed crossovers in African-American pedigrees and leveraged recombination rates inferred from the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations. We also identified direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells to investigate the role of PRDM9 in recombination in PAR1.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that, in contrast to mice, PRDM9 localizes peaks of recombination in the human PAR1. We found that recombination is a rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1, with hotspot activities differing significantly among human populations. Furthermore, we observed that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between humans and chimpanzees, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that PRDM9 remains responsible for positioning recombination events in humans, but that other factors may aid this protein in producing a high overall crossover rate. We propose that a chromatin configuration in meiosis facilitates access by PRDM9 to a high fraction of its binding sites, contributing to the uniquely high crossover rate in PAR1.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the most fine-scale genetic map of crossovers in PAR1 to date and sheds light on the mechanism of obligatory crossover in this region. Our results have significant implications for understanding the evolution of the human genome and the role of PRDM9 in recombination. The genetic maps built and validated in this work will aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome.
Title: Identification of ΔN-JMJD2A as a Key Regulator of Muscle Differentiation through Histone H3K9 Demethylation

    Abstract:
    Muscle differentiation is a tightly regulated process that involves the coordinated expression of muscle-specific genes, including myogenin (Myog), which is essential for the initiation of muscle differentiation. However, the mechanism of histone H3K9 demethylation at the Myog promoter remains unclear. Here, we identify a novel isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2A, ΔN-JMJD2A, which lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain. We show that ΔN-JMJD2A is upregulated during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes and is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. Genome-wide expression profiling and exon-specific siRNA knockdown indicate that ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for many genes induced specifically during skeletal muscle differentiation. ChIP-on-chip analysis reveals that ΔN-JMJD2A binds to genes involved in transcriptional control and promotes the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 at the Myog promoter. We conclude that induction of ΔN-JMJD2A is crucial for muscle differentiation by directing the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter, thus promoting transcriptional activation of the Myog gene and contributing to the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression.

    Research Question:
    What is the role of ΔN-JMJD2A in muscle differentiation, and how does it regulate histone H3K9 demethylation at the Myog promoter?

    Methods:
    We used a combination of genome-wide expression profiling, exon-specific siRNA knockdown, and ChIP-on-chip analysis to investigate the role of ΔN-JMJD2A in muscle differentiation.

    Main Findings:
    We identified a novel isoform of JMJD2A, ΔN-JMJD2A, which lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain. ΔN-JMJD2A is upregulated during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes and is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. Genome-wide expression profiling and exon-specific siRNA knockdown indicate that ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for many genes induced specifically during skeletal muscle differentiation. ChIP-on-chip analysis reveals that ΔN-JMJD2A binds to genes involved in transcriptional control and promotes the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 at the Myog promoter.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that ΔN-JMJD2A plays a crucial role in muscle differentiation by directing the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter, thus promoting transcriptional activation of the Myog gene and contributing to the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study identifies ΔN-JMJD2A as a key regulator of muscle differentiation through histone H3K9 demethylation at the Myog promoter. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle differentiation and highlight the importance of ΔN-JMJD2A in this process.
Title: Economic Evaluation of the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

    Abstract:
    The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) has made significant progress in reducing the incidence of Guinea worm disease (GWD), with only 25 reported cases in 2016. However, global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in the end game, when the number of cases is low and the cost per case is higher than at any other time. Using data from the GWEP, we estimate the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages from 1986 to 2030. We compare the GWEP to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and outbreak response during 2016-2030). Our results show that the GWEP costs an estimated $11 (95% uncertainty interval, $4.70-$12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The pre-certification and certification phases can cost up to $0.0041 and $0.0015 per capita per year, respectively. The cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing is estimated at $222 (118-372) in 1986-2030. Our analysis suggests that the GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by 2030 and certainly more cost-effective if the willingness to pay for one year of life lived without the risk of GWD exceeds $0.10. Even if economic costs are twice as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020, the GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing. Our study highlights the importance of completing the end game, including certification of the absence of transmission, to achieve global eradication of GWD.

    Conclusions:
    Our study highlights the importance of completing the end game, including certification of the absence of transmission, to achieve global eradication of GWD. The GWEP is a cost-effective strategy for reducing the incidence of GWD, and continued investment in the programme is warranted.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Analysis of Borrelia burgdorferi Sensu Lato BBK32 Orthologues Reveals Disparate Complement Inhibitory Activities

    **Research Question:** How do BBK32 orthologues from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex recognize and inhibit the initiating serine protease of the human classical complement pathway, C1r?

    **Methods:** We investigated the function of BBK32 orthologues from B. afzelii strain PGau (BAD16) and B. garinii strain IP90 (BGD19) using biochemical assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography.

    **Main Findings:** Our data show that B. afzelii BAD16-C exhibits BBK32-C-like activities, including high-affinity binding to purified C1r protease and C1 complex, and potent inhibition of the classical complement pathway. In contrast, recombinant B. garinii BGD19-C bound C1 and C1r with high-affinity but exhibited significantly reduced in vitro complement inhibitory activities relative to BBK32-C or BAD16-C. The crystal structure of BBK32-C revealed an anti-parallel four-helix bundle fold with a fifth alpha-helix protruding from the helical core, and the three residues targeted in the BXK32-C chimera are surface-exposed, supporting their potential relevance in C1r binding and inhibition.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that BBK32-like classical pathway complement inhibition is shared across major species of Lyme disease-associated spirochetes, but with varying levels of activity. The reduced complement inhibitory activity of BGD19-C may contribute to the increased susceptibility of B. garinii to human serum killing.

    **Conclusions:** This study improves our understanding of how BBK32 recognizes and inhibits C1r and provides new insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme-associated spirochetes of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The structural and functional analysis of BBK32 orthologues has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat Lyme disease.

    **Title:** Post-translational Phosphorylation of Fkh2 Regulates the Switch from Commensalism to Pathogenicity in Candida albicans

    **Research Question:** How do post-translational phosphorylation events regulate the morphological and transcriptional adaptation of Candida albicans from commensalism to pathogenicity?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and mutational analyses to investigate the post-translational phosphorylation of the Fkh2 transcription factor in Candida albicans. We also used transcript profiling and cell cycle-independent assays to examine the functional consequences of Fkh2 phosphorylation.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Fkh2 undergoes a radical shift in its phosphorylation profile upon hyphal induction, mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1. This shift activates Fkh2 to promote the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. We identified specific residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1, and substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile.

    **Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. This discovery highlights the importance of post-translational phosphorylation in regulating the morphological and transcriptional adaptation of Candida albicans.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity in Candida albicans. The identification of Fkh2 as a regulatory target of Cdc28 and Cbk1, and its phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the chromatin modifier Pob3, provides a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenicity of Candida albicans and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this opportunistic human fungal pathogen.

    Title: Essential Role of Thymidine Kinase in Pyrimidine Biosynthesis and Infectivity of Trypanosoma brucei

    Research Question: What is the role of thymidine kinase (TK) in pyrimidine biosynthesis and infectivity of Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite?

    Methods: We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of TK in T. brucei. We generated TK conditional null and RNAi cells and analyzed their growth and infectivity in a mouse model. We also performed metabolite profiling by LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis to identify potential candidate genes encoding 5'-nucleotidase activity.

    Main Findings: Our results show that TK is essential for growth and infectivity of T. brucei, and that a catalytically active enzyme is required for its function. Unlike humans, T. brucei lacks dCMP deaminase (DCTD), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCTD resulted in full rescue of the RNAi growth phenotype and allowed for selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling revealed a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides in TK-depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase (CDA) led to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy, suggesting the presence of an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that TK is essential for synthesis of thymine nucleotides in T. brucei, regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or through salvage. The reliance on TK in the absence of DCTD may be a shared vulnerability among trypanosomatids, providing a unique opportunity to selectively target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes with a single drug.

    Conclusions: In summary, our study reveals the essential role of TK in pyrimidine biosynthesis and infectivity of T. brucei. The identification of an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that promotes interconversion between cytosine and thymine deoxynucleotide pools highlights the complexity of pyrimidine metabolism in T. brucei. These findings have significant implications for the development of a pan-trypanosomatid therapy targeting TK.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Shine-Dalgarno-Independent Translation Initiation in Prokaryotes

    Abstract:
    Translation initiation in prokaryotes is a highly regulated process that typically requires interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon, known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. However, a significant proportion of prokaryotic genes lack Shine-Dalgarno sequences, raising the question of how start codon recognition and efficient translation initiation occur in these mRNAs. To address this question, we performed genome-wide searches in various prokaryotic groups to identify sequence elements and/or RNA secondary structural motifs that facilitate translation initiation in mRNAs lacking Shine-Dalgarno sequences. Our bioinformatics analyses revealed that mRNAs without Shine-Dalgarno sequences are generally less structured in their translation initiation region and exhibit a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Experimental support for local RNA unfoldedness determining start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation was provided using reporter gene constructs in bacteria. We found that AUG start codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal AUG codons are usually in structured regions of the mRNA. Our results suggest that local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation, providing a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of translation initiation in prokaryotes and highlight the importance of RNA structure in regulating gene expression.
Title: Incidence and Characteristics of Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in Patients Treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B (Ambisome) for Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar, India

    Abstract:

    Background: Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a skin disorder that occurs in up to 10% of patients treated for Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in India. The pathogenesis of PKDL is not fully understood, and cases have been reported following various treatments, including liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome).

    Research Question: What are the characteristics of patients who develop PKDL following treatment with Ambisome for VL in Bihar, India?

    Methods: This observational retrospective cohort study analyzed the outcomes of 8749 patients treated with 20 mg/kg intravenous Ambisome as first-line treatment for VL between July 2007 and August 2012. Patients who returned to the treatment program with symptoms of PKDL were identified, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were compared to those of the remaining cohort.

    Main Findings: Of the 8311 patients completing treatment for their first episode of VL, 24 (0.3%) returned with symptoms of PKDL, diagnosed from clinical history, appearance consistent with PKDL, and slit-skin smear examination. The median time to development of PKDL was 1.2 (0.8-2.2) years following treatment. Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics did not identify any significant risk factors for PKDL. However, the time to developing PKDL was significantly shorter with Ambisome than in a subset of patients presenting to the program with PKDL following previous sodium stibogluconate treatment for VL.

    Implications: This study suggests that PKDL following treatment with Ambisome for VL in Bihar, India is infrequent, with no predictive risk factors identified. However, the shorter median time to developing symptoms of PKDL compared to conventional VL treatments should be taken into account when counseling patients treated with regimens including Ambisome.

    Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of patients who develop PKDL following treatment with Ambisome for VL in Bihar, India. The findings highlight the importance of continued monitoring and education of patients regarding the possibility and symptoms of PKDL. Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis of PKDL and to identify potential risk factors.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Dynamics of Reinfestation in Triatoma infestans: Insights from Continuous- and Discrete-Time Models

    **Research Question:** How do continuous- and discrete-time models fitted to patch-level infestation states elucidate the dynamics of reinfestation in Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease?

    **Methods:** We employed discrete- and continuous-time Markov models to analyze spatiotemporal population data of T. infestans in three villages in northwest Argentina. The models were used to estimate the probabilities of bug establishment on each site, taking into account the effects of season, previous infestation, and insecticide spraying.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed a 6-month time lag between detection of a new infestation and dispersal events. We found that more new bug populations become established from May to November than from November to May, coinciding with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. Furthermore, the probability of new bug establishment increases with increasing time since last detected infestation. These findings challenge our current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight important gaps in knowledge.

    **Implications:** Our results have significant implications for the control of Chagas disease. Understanding the seasonality of bug dispersal intensity and distance is crucial for optimizing the timing of vector control. The analysis also highlights the importance of considering the properties of individual target sites, such as their distance from source sites, infestation history, and spraying history, to maximize the efficiency of vector control.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the utility of continuous- and discrete-time models in elucidating the dynamics of reinfestation in T. infestans. Our findings provide new insights into the ecology of T. infestans and highlight the need for further research to close the gaps in our understanding of this vector. The results of this study will inform the development of more effective strategies for controlling Chagas disease, particularly in resource-limited areas of South America.

    **Title:** Investigating the Effects of Polyomavirus SV40 MicroRNA on Viral Pathogenesis in Vivo: A Study in Syrian Golden Hamsters

    **Research Question:** What are the effects of polyomavirus SV40 microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in vivo, and how does the structure of the regulatory region influence the dynamics of SV40 DNA levels in infected tissues?

    **Methods:** Outbred young adult Syrian golden hamsters were inoculated with 1×10^7 plaque-forming units of four different variants of SV40 via the intracardiac route. Infected animals were sacrificed at various time points from 3 to 270 days post-infection, and viral DNA loads in different tissues were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that SV40 displays a broad tissue tropism, infecting liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain tissues, with liver and kidney containing higher viral DNA loads than other tissues. Notably, kidneys were the preferred site for long-term persistent infection, while detectable virus was also retained in livers. Expression of SV40 microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV40-infected tissues, and microRNA-negative mutant viruses consistently produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney, and infectious virus was detected infrequently.

    **Implications:** This study provides the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo, demonstrating that viral microRNA dampens viral DNA levels in tissues infected by SV40 strains with simple or complex regulatory regions. Our findings suggest that SV40 microRNA plays a role in regulating viral replication and persistence in infected tissues.

    **Conclusions:** This study identifies broad tissue tropism for SV40 in vivo in hamsters and highlights the importance of SV40 microRNA in modulating viral pathogenesis. Our results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of polyomavirus infections and the role of microRNA in regulating viral replication and persistence. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which SV40 microRNA exerts its effects on viral pathogenesis.

    **Title:** Comprehensive Genome-Wide Examination of Positively Selected Genes in Mammals Reveals Insights into Evolutionary Dynamics and Functional Implications

    **Research Question:** What are the dynamics of genome evolution and the genetic basis of differences between species in mammals, and what are the functions of individual genes that have undergone positive selection?

    **Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide scan for positively selected genes (PSGs) in eutherian mammals using six high-coverage genome assemblies. We applied a standard likelihood ratio test to identify genes with significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) and performed additional lineage- and clade-specific tests.

    **Main Findings:** Of approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, as well as more specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes.

    **Implications:** Our study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection. The results suggest that PSGs are often expressed at lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment of PSGs among brain-specific genes.

    **Conclusions:** This study represents the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, leveraging the increased phylogenetic depth of six high-coverage genome assemblies. Our findings highlight the importance of positive selection in shaping the mammalian genome and provide new insights into the functional implications of this process. The results have significant implications for our understanding of mammalian evolution and the genetic basis of differences between species.

    **Title:** Novel Amyloid-Like Fibrils Composed of Phenol Soluble Modulins (PSMs) Promote Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Integrity

    **Research Question:** What is the role of phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) in the formation and maintenance of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms?

    **Methods:** We employed biochemical and genetic analysis to investigate the composition and function of extracellular fibril structures in S. aureus biofilms. We isolated and purified amyloid-like fibers from S. aureus cultures and characterized their morphological and biophysical properties. We also generated mutants unable to produce PSMs and tested their susceptibility to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure composed of PSMs that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers have amyloid-like properties and consist of small peptides called PSMs. We found that mutants unable to produce PSMs were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms, while polymerized peptides do not.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid-like fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. This is the first report to identify and characterize extracellular fimbriae in S. aureus biofilms. Our results implicate fibril formation as a means of altering PSM activity and function in the microenvironment of the biofilm.

    **Conclusions:** The discovery of amyloid-like fibrils composed of PSMs provides new insights into the mechanisms of S. aureus biofilm formation and maintenance. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target S. aureus biofilms, which are a major cause of persistent infections in humans. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of PSMs in S. aureus biofilms and to explore the potential of targeting amyloid-like fibrils as a therapeutic approach.
Title: Development of a Novel Antibody Profiling Assay for Monitoring Trypanosoma cruzi Persistence in Chagas Disease Patients

    Abstract:
    Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects approximately six million individuals in over 20 countries worldwide. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is crucial for developing and evaluating treatments to control the disease. Traditional serological assays and PCR testing have limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood. This study aimed to evaluate a newly developed antibody profiling assay as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on the waning of antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection. We designed a multiplex serology assay using an array of 15 optimized T. cruzi antigens to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One specific antibody response, Ab3, showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signals were strongly associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, whereas significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in BZN-treated patients who cleared parasitemia based on blood PCR results. Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. We hypothesize that Ab3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques. Therefore, a simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.

    Methods:
    We designed a multiplex serology assay using an array of 15 optimized T. cruzi antigens to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients.

    Main Findings:
    One specific antibody response, Ab3, showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signals were strongly associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, whereas significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in BZN-treated patients who cleared parasitemia based on blood PCR results.

    Implications:
    Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. A simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates the potential of a novel antibody profiling assay for monitoring Trypanosoma cruzi persistence in Chagas disease patients. The identification of Ab3 as a surrogate biomarker for parasite persistence has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease. Further studies are needed to validate the use of Ab3 in clinical settings and to explore its potential as a tool for monitoring treatment efficacy.

    **Title:** Identification of Musculoskeletal Cells as Reservoirs of Chronic Chikungunya Virus Infection

    **Research Question:** What cells contribute to the persistence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in musculoskeletal tissues during the chronic phase of disease?

    **Methods:** We generated a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre) to permanently mark infected cells in reporter mice. CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts, inducing arthritis during the acute phase and chronic disease in mice.

    **Main Findings:** CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre infection of tdTomato reporter mice resulted in a population of tdTomato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric profiling revealed that these tdTomato+ cells predominantly consisted of myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of tdTomato+ cells and diminished chronic viral RNA levels, implicating these cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that musculoskeletal cells, specifically myofibers and fibroblasts, play a crucial role in the persistence of CHIKV in the chronic phase of disease. The CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system provides a valuable tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.

    **Conclusions:** This study identifies the cells that survive CHIKV infection in vivo and are enriched for persistent CHIKV RNA, providing new insights into the mechanism of chronic CHIKV pathogenesis. The CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato system represents a useful tool for further investigating the role of musculoskeletal cells in CHIKV persistence and developing effective therapeutic strategies to combat chronic CHIKV disease.

    **Title:** Investigating the Generalizability of Dimensionality Reduction Methods to Large-Scale Neural Population Activity

    **Research Question:** How do dimensionality reduction methods, such as factor analysis (FA) and principal component analysis (PCA), generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, and how do these results relate to the underlying network structure?

    **Methods:** We applied FA to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction—shared dimensionality and percent shared variance—with neuron and trial count.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network.

    **Implications:** These findings have important implications for the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling. Our results suggest that FA provides a more nuanced characterization of single-trial population activity than PCA, particularly in networks with clustered connectivity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study addresses two critical questions in the field of neural population activity: how dimensionality reduction methods generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, and how these results relate to the underlying network structure. By applying FA to in vivo recordings and spiking network models, we demonstrate that recordings from tens of neurons are sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.
Title: Modulation of Host Immune Responses by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Quorum Sensing-Regulated Molecule 2-Amino Acetophenone (2-AA): Implications for Pathogen Persistence and Host Tolerance

    Abstract:

    Background: Bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signals have been implicated in immunomodulation, but the mechanisms by which microbes utilize these signals to maintain infection remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS-regulated molecule 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA) in modulating host immune responses.

    Methods: Mice were treated with 2-AA prior to infection with P. aeruginosa, and survival rates, immune response activation, and cytokine profiles were analyzed.

    Main Findings: Our results show that 2-AA pretreatment significantly increased host survival rates (90%) compared to non-pretreated infected mice (10%). 2-AA stimulation activated key innate immune response pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuated immune response activation upon pretreatment, likely by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Notably, 2-AA pretreatment led to a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB activation, with preserved activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, resulting in CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (c/EBPβ) activation and formation of the c/EBPβ-p65 complex that prevents NF-κB activation.

    Implications: Our findings reveal a QS immunomodulatory signal that promotes original aspects of interkingdom communication, facilitating pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance to infection. The ability of 2-AA to dampen inflammatory processes while increasing host survival and pathogen persistence concurs with its ability to signal bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the contribution of the low-molecular-weight QS molecule 2-AA in modulating mammalian innate-immune signaling pathways, providing new insights into the complex interplay between P. aeruginosa and its host. Our results suggest that 2-AA's immunomodulatory effects may be an adaptive strategy for the pathogen to secure long-term survival within its host, highlighting the intricate balance between host-pathogen interactions.

    **Title:** The Evolutionary Origins and Functions of L1TD1: A Domesticated Retroelement Gene in Mammals

    **Research Question:** How did the L1TD1 gene, a domesticated retroelement gene, originate and evolve in mammals, and what are its functional roles in different lineages?

    **Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history, origins, and selective pressures of the L1TD1 gene in mammals using genome-wide searches, phylogenetic reconstruction, and comparative genomics.

    **Main Findings:** Our study reveals that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, approximately 106 million years ago. We found that L1TD1 has been lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution, but has been under positive selection in primate and mouse lineages. Notably, one prosimian L1TD1 has "replenished" itself with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome. We also observed that L1TD1 loss is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that L1TD1 has been recurrently selected for functional novelty, potentially for a role in genome defense. We propose that L1TD1 could have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements, and later became incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and demonstrates that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages. The conservation of L1TD1's bipartite double-ORF1p organization since its birth underscores its importance in mammalian evolution. Our results provide new insights into the evolutionary history and functional roles of L1TD1, and shed light on the complex relationships between retroelements, genome defense, and pluripotency maintenance in mammals.

    **Title:** YbeY: A Conserved Endoribonuclease Essential for Virulence, Stress Regulation, and Ribosome Quality Control in Vibrio cholerae

    **Research Question:** What is the role of YbeY, a highly conserved protein, in Vibrio cholerae, a human pathogen, and how does it contribute to its virulence, stress regulation, and ribosome quality control?

    **Methods:** We analyzed the rRNA and ribosome profiles of a Vibrio cholerae strain partially depleted for YbeY and other RNase mutants associated with 16 S rRNA processing. We also examined the effects of YbeY depletion on virulence, stress regulation, and ribosome quality control in V. cholerae.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that YbeY is an essential endoribonuclease in V. cholerae, crucial for 16 S rRNA 3′ end maturation, subunit assembly into 70 S ribosomes, and ribosome quality control. Depletion of YbeY in V. cholerae impairs its ability to colonize mice, form biofilms, and produce cholera toxin, and alters the expression levels of virulence-associated small RNAs. We also show that YbeY is part of a core set of RNases essential in most representative pathogens.

    **Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of YbeY in V. cholerae pathogenesis and stress regulation, and demonstrate its conserved function across species in essential cellular processes. The high conservation of YbeY's activity in stress regulation is further supported by the ability of the ybeY genes of several distantly related pathogens to complement an E. coli ΔybeY strain under various stress conditions.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first comprehensive exploration of YbeY's physiological role in a human pathogen, showing its conserved function across species in essential cellular processes. Our results underscore the importance of YbeY in V. cholerae virulence, stress regulation, and ribosome quality control, and highlight its potential as a target for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Assortativity in Transcription Factor Networks: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Human Cell and Tissue Types

    **Research Question:** What is the relationship between the assortativity signature of transcription factor networks (TFNs) and the robustness of gene expression phenotypes to perturbation in human cell and tissue types?

    **Methods:** We employed publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. We analyzed the topological properties of these TFNs, including their degree distribution and assortativity, to determine the extent to which each component of the assortativity signature contributes to phenotypic robustness.

    **Main Findings:** Our results reveal that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature, which confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. Furthermore, we found that this signature is composed of four distinct components, each of which contributes to the robustness of the gene expression phenotype to perturbation. Notably, we observed that the out-in assortativity of nearly all TFNs (38 of 41) was sensitive to the removal of the top 2% of hub TFs, whereas the out-out assortativity of only a third of the TFNs (14 of 41) was similarly sensitive.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the assortativity signature of TFNs provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks. The shared assortativity signature across human cell and tissue types implies that this property may be a conserved feature of TFNs, contributing to the robustness of gene expression phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first genome-wide characterization of the assortativity signatures of TFNs in human cell and tissue types. Our results highlight the importance of considering the assortativity signature in the theoretical understanding of networked systems, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation. The identification of a shared assortativity signature across TFNs suggests that this property may be a key determinant of phenotypic robustness in biological networks.

    **Title:** Inhibitory Neurons Dominate Cortical Encoding of Stimulus-Related Information in the Somatosensory Barrel Cortex

    **Research Question:** How do populations of inhibitory (INH) and excitatory (EXC) neocortical neurons collectively encode stimulus-related information in the somatosensory barrel cortex?

    **Methods:** We employed large-scale multi-electrode arrays (up to 128 channels) to simultaneously record the activity of cell ensembles (up to 74 neurons) distributed across all layers of 3-4 neighboring cortical columns in the anesthetized adult rat somatosensory barrel cortex in vivo. Two different whisker stimulus modalities (location and frequency) were used to elicit sensory-evoked cortical activity.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that individual INH neurons outperform EXC neurons in discriminating between restricted sets of stimuli (≤6 stimulus classes) in granular and infra-granular layers. Moreover, ensembles of INH cells collectively provide as much information about stimuli as comparable ensembles containing the ~20% most informative EXC neurons, with less information redundancy. This suggests that a consortium of INH neurons dominates the information conveyed to the neocortical network, efficiently processing incoming sensory activity.

    **Implications:** These findings extend our understanding of the role of the inhibitory system in orchestrating cortical activity. The high stimulus-related information content in INH cells at both tested stimulus modalities (location and frequency) implies that barrel cortex interneurons may be more sharply tuned to different stimuli than principal neurons.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that INH neurons play a crucial role in encoding stimulus-related information in the somatosensory barrel cortex. The lower redundancy and higher precision of INH cell ensembles compared to EXC cell ensembles suggest that INH neurons are more efficient in conveying information to the neocortical network. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of cortical processing and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

    **Title:** Engineering a Genetic Half Adder in Escherichia coli using De Novo Riboregulation

    **Research Question:** Can regulatory RNAs be used to engineer a fundamental arithmetic logic unit, such as a genetic half adder, in a living cell?

    **Methods:** We engineered a genetic system in Escherichia coli that exploits post-transcriptional control and allosteric transcription factors to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations of IPTG and aTc. The system uses riboregulators of translation initiation to implement the design.

    **Main Findings:** We successfully programmed a bacterial cell to perform the binary sum of two bits of information, encoded into the concentrations of IPTG and aTc, and report the sum as red fluorescence and the carry as green fluorescence. Our designer circuit robustly performs the intended computation, demonstrating that regulatory RNAs can be key players in synthetic biology.

    **Implications:** This work paves the way for engineering more complex RNA-based biocomputers using this designer circuit as a building block. The use of regulatory RNAs offers an alternative to protein-based regulation, which is limited by the number of available transcription factors and their propensity for composability and orthogonality with the host machinery.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of de novo riboregulation to engineer fundamental arithmetic logic units in living cells. The use of regulatory RNAs allows for a more scalable and organized architecture, with a reduced genetic footprint compared to circuits fully implemented with transcription factors. This work contributes to the development of RNA-based biocomputers and highlights the importance of exploring alternative approaches to protein-based regulation in synthetic biology. The designer circuit presented here can be used as a building block for more complex RNA-based biocomputers, enabling the development of novel applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology.
Title: Identification of Ribonucleoside Phosphonates as Cytosolic 5′-Nucleotidase II (cN-II) Inhibitors: Implications for Cancer Therapy

Abstract:

Background: Cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular nucleotide pools by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. High levels of cN-II expression have been correlated with poor patient outcomes in cancer therapy, particularly when treated with cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. To elucidate the specific role of cN-II in resistance to cancer therapy, we screened a class of chemical compounds, ribonucleoside phosphonates, as potential cN-II inhibitors.

Methods: We designed and synthesized 34 phosphonate analogues of nucleoside 5′-monophosphates, incorporating a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of the natural phosphoester bond. Among the 25 synthesized analogues, 12 possessed a hydroxyl group in the β-position related to the phosphorus atom. We evaluated the binding strength of these analogues to cN-II using in silico docking predictions and experimental measurements of nucleotidase activity.

Results: Six phosphonate analogues (19, 21, 23, and 32-34) showed higher scores than the natural substrate, inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP), indicating their potential as cN-II inhibitors. The binding strength of these compounds was attributed to an impressive number of van der Waals contacts, highlighting the crucial role of three cN-II residues: Phe157, His209, and Tyr210. Experimental measurements confirmed that the three best available phosphonate analogues induced a total inhibition of cN-II activity at 2 mM.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in the design of new competitive cN-II inhibitors. The results demonstrate that ribonucleoside phosphonates can efficiently mimic nucleoside 5′-monophosphates and inhibit cN-II activity. The identification of these compounds as potential cN-II inhibitors has significant implications for cancer therapy, particularly in the development of new strategies to overcome resistance to cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. Further studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of these phosphonate analogues in cancer treatment.
Title: Detection of Prion Infectivity in Colostrum and Milk from Sheep Incubating Natural Scrapie: Implications for Animal and Human Health

    Abstract:
    We investigated the presence of prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting small ruminants. Our study aimed to determine whether milk and colostrum from scrapie-affected ewes pose a risk to animal and human health. We detected consistent levels of prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from scrapie-affected ewes, several months prior to clinical onset. Immunohistochemistry and PET blot analysis revealed abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) accumulation in lacteal ducts and mammary acini, particularly in ewes with mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles resulting from Maedi lentivirus infection. However, bioassay revealed that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum from both ewes with and without lymphoproliferative chronic mastitis. The highest infectious titre measured in milk and colostrum was equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. Our findings indicate that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the animal TSE transmission process, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. These results raise concerns about the risk of TSE exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species. Our study provides definitive evidence of the presence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from naturally incubating scrapie ewes, highlighting the need for re-evaluation of the safety of dairy products from TSE-affected ruminant flocks.

    Methods:
    This study employed a combination of immunohistochemistry, PET blot analysis, and bioassay to detect prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from scrapie-affected ewes.

    Main Findings:
    We detected consistent levels of prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from scrapie-affected ewes, several months prior to clinical onset. Prion protein (PrPSc) accumulation was observed in lacteal ducts and mammary acini, particularly in ewes with mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles resulting from Maedi lentivirus infection. Bioassay revealed that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum from both ewes with and without lymphoproliferative chronic mastitis.

    Implications:
    Our findings indicate that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the animal TSE transmission process, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. These results raise concerns about the risk of TSE exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species.

    Conclusions:
    Our study provides definitive evidence of the presence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from naturally incubating scrapie ewes, highlighting the need for re-evaluation of the safety of dairy products from TSE-affected ruminant flocks.
Title: Epidemiological Analysis of the 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia: Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Confirmed and Suspected Cases

    Abstract:

    Background: The 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed and suspected EVD cases during the outbreak.

    Methods: We analyzed 16,370 laboratory samples collected between April 4, 2014, and March 29, 2015. A total of 10,536 traceable individuals were identified, of whom 3,897 were confirmed cases (positive for Ebola virus RNA). We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA.

    Results: Our analysis revealed significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases. Young children and the elderly were at higher risk of death due to EVD. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period.

    Implications: These findings provide valuable insights into the demographic and clinical characteristics of EVD cases during the 2014-2016 outbreak in Liberia. The identification of risk factors, such as age and place of residence, can inform public health strategies to mitigate the impact of future outbreaks.

Title: Elucidating the Catalytic Mechanism of Tyrosinase: A Cryo-Trapped Crystallographic Study

    Abstract:
    Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of phenol to its corresponding ortho-quinone. Despite extensive studies, the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase has remained unclear at an atomic level. To address this knowledge gap, we employed cryo-trapped crystallography to determine the structures of tyrosinase at high resolutions (1.16-1.70 Å). Our results reveal a crucial step in the tyrosinase reaction: the movement of CuA, which induces the syn-to-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) core. This rearrangement places the hydroxyl group of the substrate in an equatorial position, facilitating electrophilic attack by the Cu2O2 oxidant.

    Using UV-vis and resonance Raman spectroscopic analyses, we confirmed that the Tyr98 residue is converted to a reactive quinone through the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone intermediates. Our crystallographic results (ST3, ST4, and ST6) indicate that the movement of CuA to the CuA-3 site occurs prior to the hydroxylation reaction, suggesting that CuA-3 is the functional site. Based on these findings, we propose a catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase toward the caddie Tyr98 residue, which involves the coordination preference determined by the oxidation state of copper and the protonation state triggering the generation of reaction intermediates.

    Our study provides new insights into the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, a type 3 copper protein family that includes catechol oxidase and hemocyanin. The proposed mechanism highlights the importance of CuA movement and the syn-to-anti rearrangement of copper ligands in facilitating the hydroxylation reaction. These findings have implications for understanding the catalytic mechanisms of other type 3 copper proteins and may inform the design of novel biocatalysts.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Role of Dbp6p Helicase and Npa1p Complex in Eukaryotic Ribosome Biogenesis

    **Research Question:** How do the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex contribute to the early steps of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the formation of the large ribosomal subunit?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, including tandem affinity purifications, in vivo cross-linking analysis (CRAC), and yeast genetics, to investigate the interactions between the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

    **Main Findings:** We demonstrate that the Dbp6p helicase associates with a core complex formed by Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p, which is essential for the stable integration of Dbp6p within the initial 90S pre-ribosomal particle. We show that Npa1p forms the backbone of the core complex and directly interacts with Dbp6p and Npa2p. Furthermore, we identify specific rRNA binding sites on 25S rRNA adjacent to the root helices of the first and last secondary structure domains, suggesting that Npa1p and Dbp6p function in the formation and/or clustering of root helices of large subunit rRNAs.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions. We propose that the Npa1p/Npa2p/Nop8p/Rsa3p core complex is necessary not only for the stable integration of the Dbp6p helicase at the correct site within 90S pre-ribosomal particles but also for the modulation of its enzymatic activities.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the early steps of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, highlighting the importance of the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex in the formation of the large ribosomal subunit. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of ribosome biogenesis and the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.

    **Title:** Catecholamine Systems Regulate Learning Rate in Response to Environmental Change

    **Research Question:** Do catecholamine systems, specifically norepinephrine and dopamine, play a causal role in regulating learning rate in response to environmental change?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of pharmacology, scalp electrophysiology, and computational modeling (N = 32 participants) to investigate the role of catecholamine systems in learning rate regulation. Participants completed a predictive-inference task that provided direct measures of prediction error and learning rate on each trial.

    **Main Findings:** The study found that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic catecholamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and formally mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. Furthermore, P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of two computational variables – capturing the unexpectedness of an outcome and the uncertainty of a preexisting belief – on learning rate. Additionally, a pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, in a way that depended on participants’ baseline learning rate.

    **Implications:** These findings provide converging evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change. The results suggest that the phasic catecholamine response following surprising outcomes drives subsequent increases in learning rate, and that the catecholamine systems are well-positioned to regulate learning about environmental change.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides novel evidence for a role of the human catecholamine systems in learning rate regulation, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior in a changing world. The findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of learning and decision-making, and highlight the importance of catecholamine systems in regulating learning rate in response to environmental change.

    **Title:** Successful Implementation of EPIMIC Syndromic Surveillance System in Rural Senegal Using Point-of-Care Laboratory Data

    **Research Question:** Can a homemade syndromic surveillance system, EPIMIC, be effectively implemented in rural Senegal using data routinely produced by Point-of-Care (POC) laboratories to monitor infectious diseases?

    **Methods:** Two POC laboratories were established in rural Senegal villages, Dielmo and Ndiop, from 2010 to 2016. A homemade syndromic surveillance system, EPIMIC, was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data produced by the POC laboratory of the Timone hospital in Marseille, France. The system was later adapted to use data from the two POC laboratories in Senegal.

    **Main Findings:** Over 5 years, 2,577 deduplicated patients-samples couples from 775 different patients were tested in the Dielmo and Ndiop POC laboratories, with 739 deduplicated patients-samples couples found to be positive to at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the data with EPIMIC generated 443 alarms. In the Niakhar POC laboratory, 316 deduplicated patients-samples couples from 298 different patients were processed, with 56 deduplicated patients-samples couples found to be positive to at least one of the tested pathogens, generating 14 alarms.

    **Implications:** The successful implementation of EPIMIC in rural Senegal demonstrates the scalability and versatility of the system, which can be adapted to use data from POC laboratories in resource-limited settings. The system's ability to detect true epidemiological events without heavy human and economic resources makes it a valuable tool for infectious disease surveillance in low-resource settings.

    **Conclusions:** EPIMIC has been successfully implemented in rural Senegal using data routinely produced by two POC laboratories. The system's ability to survey 27 POC tests for 15 pathogens in near real-time makes it a valuable asset for infectious disease surveillance in Africa. Further improvements are needed to enhance the EPIMIC syndromic surveillance network, but this study demonstrates the potential of EPIMIC to improve global knowledge on infectious diseases in resource-limited settings.

    **Title:** Architecture-Dependent Collective Calcium Signaling in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells

    **Research Question:** What is the role of structural arrangement of endothelial cells in collective calcium signaling and cell contractility in response to histamine stimulation?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning to investigate the effects of cellular architecture on histamine-induced calcium signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We monitored calcium oscillations in individual cells, monolayers, self-assembled capillary-like networks, and plasma lithography microengineered cell networks.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that endothelial cells in self-assembled and microengineered networks, but not individual cells and monolayers, exhibit calcium oscillations in response to histamine stimulation. We found that the calcium oscillation depends on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication, as revealed by micropatterning, pharmacological inhibition, and computational modeling. Furthermore, the calcium oscillation attenuates histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling. This has significant implications for understanding the functional implications of diverse vascular structures in response to external stimuli.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides a mechanistic basis for the architecture-dependent calcium signaling in endothelial cells and highlights the importance of considering the structural arrangement of cells in understanding cellular responses to chemical stimuli. The results of this study have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for vascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis, where endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role.

    **Title:** Identification of Multiple Protective Sites in RSV G Protein Outside of the Conserved Central Domain for Vaccine Development

    **Background:** Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. Understanding the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection is crucial for the development of effective vaccines.

    **Research Question:** What is the contribution of antigenic regions outside of the conserved central domain (CCD) of the RSV G protein to RSV-specific immunity?

    **Methods:** We evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of all RSV-G antigenic sites identified following primary RSV infection using recombinant E. coli-expressed G ectodomain (REG), CCD-deleted G ectodomain (REGΔCCD), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides in rabbits and mice.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that REGΔCCD, N- and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound fully glycosylated Recombinant Mammalian-expressed G ectodomain (RMG) and intact RSV virion particles. However, minimal in vitro neutralization titers were observed compared to the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice challenged with RSV-A2 Line 19F showed significantly reduced viral replication in the nasal cavity and lungs compared to unimmunized controls. Control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles.

    **Implications:** These findings demonstrate the presence of multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the CCD that could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as a safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of antigenic regions outside of the CCD for RSV-specific immunity and provides new insights into the development of a vaccine against RSV disease. The identification of multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the CCD suggests that a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein could be a promising candidate for a safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.

    **Title:** Target-Derived Signaling Regulates Neuronal Diversity through RNA Processing: A Role for Brr2 in Tv4 Neuron Specification

    **Research Question:** How do target-derived signals regulate neuronal diversity during embryonic development, and what is the role of RNA processing in this process?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and molecular biology techniques to investigate the role of Brr2 and Prp8, components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, in the specification of Tv4 neurons in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC). We performed a genetic screen to identify genes involved in Tv4 specification and found that Brr2 and Prp8 play crucial roles in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide specifically in six neurons of the VNC.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Brr2 and Prp8 control Tv4 neuron specification through two independent mechanisms: (1) proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue to receive the BMP ligand, and (2) proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway, tkv and Medea. We also found that Brr2 regulates the activation of the BMP retrograde signaling pathway in Tv4 neurons at three different points: axonal pathfinding, Dimm expression, and activation of the BMP signaling pathway.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals a novel role for RNA processing in the diversification of neuronal identity within the central nervous system. The findings suggest that Brr2 and Prp8, components of the spliceosome, play a cell-specific role in controlling the specification of the neuropeptidergic identity of Tv4 neurons. This study highlights the importance of target-derived signals in regulating neuronal diversity and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying nervous system development.

    **Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that Brr2 and Prp8 are essential for the proper specification of Tv4 neurons in the Drosophila VNC. The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of RNA processing in neuronal development and highlight the importance of target-derived signals in regulating neuronal diversity. Further studies on the function of Brr2 and Prp8 will provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nervous system development.

    **Title:** A Novel Pathway for Regulation of F-box Protein Abundance in Cullin-RING Ubiquitin Ligases

    **Research Question:** How is the abundance of substrate receptor subunits of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) tightly controlled to maintain the full repertoire of CRLs, and what are the implications of unbalanced levels on cellular processes?

    **Methods:** We investigated the regulation of F-box proteins, a class of substrate receptor subunits of CRLs, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to identify a novel pathway for the degradation of F-box proteins that are dissociated from Skp1, a central component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered a Skp1-independent ubiquitylation pathway that targets F-box proteins, such as Met30, that are detached from Skp1. This pathway involves the SCF core components Cdc53 and Rbx1, as well as the cognate SCF ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Notably, this pathway does not require Skp1 and suggests a function of Cdc53/Cul1 that is independent of its association with Skp1.

    **Implications:** Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the regulation of CRLs and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The novel pathway we describe provides a mechanism for the degradation of F-box proteins that are not bound to Skp1, which is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress. Moreover, our results assign important biological functions to a sub-complex of CRLs that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34, but is independent of Skp1.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals a novel pathway for the regulation of F-box protein abundance in CRLs, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stresses. Our findings provide new insights into the complex regulation of CRLs and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms that control the abundance of substrate receptor subunits in these enzymes.

    **Title:** Revisiting the Regulation of Kinesin-3 Motors: Dimeric KIF1A Motors are Autoinhibited and Activated by Cargo Binding

    **Research Question:** How are Kinesin-3 motors, specifically KIF1A, regulated to drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells?

    **Methods:** Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, we examined the activity and dimerization state of KIF1A motors in both native and expressed forms.

    **Main Findings:** Contrary to current models, we found that KIF1A motors exist in a dimeric, inactive state in the absence of cargo, and are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Instead, we identified two distinct inhibitory mechanisms that autoinhibit dimeric KIF1A motors. Successive truncations of KIF1A resulted in monomeric and dimeric motors that underwent one-dimensional diffusion along microtubules, but only dimeric motors exhibited ATP-dependent processive motility.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that KIF1A motors are uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells. The autoinhibition mechanism provides a simple model for the activation of dimeric KIF1A motors by cargo binding, which is essential for the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of Kinesin-3 motors, specifically KIF1A, and challenges the current understanding of cargo-induced dimerization as a mechanism of activation. Our findings have important implications for understanding the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells, and highlight the importance of autoinhibition in regulating the activity of KIF1A motors. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the hand-over-hand mechanism of dimeric KIF1A motors and their role in long-distance transport in neuronal cells.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Regulation of Seed Metabolism in Tomato: A Metabolite Profiling and Network Analysis Approach

    **Research Question:** To investigate the genetic basis of natural variability in seed primary metabolism and its response to environmental perturbations in a collection of tomato introgression lines (ILs).

    **Methods:** Metabolite profiling and network analysis were applied to a collection of 76 homozygous tomato ILs grown in the field in two consecutive harvest seasons. Factorial ANOVA was used to identify metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and estimate the degree of metabolic natural variability.

    **Main Findings:** Amino acid contents displayed a high degree of variability across the population, with similar patterns across the two seasons, while sugars exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Integration of data for tomato pericarp metabolite profiling revealed that the genotypic background was the main factor for metabolic polymorphism, rather than the environment or tissue. Analysis of the coefficient of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in the ILs than in the M82 tomato cultivar. Broad-sense estimate of heritability suggested that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit. Correlation-based metabolic network analysis showed that the seed network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit, with amino acids playing a central hub-like role in the topology of the network.

    **Implications:** These results reflect the extensive redundancy of the regulation underlying seed metabolism, demonstrate the tight co-ordination of seed metabolism with respect to fruit metabolism, and emphasize the centrality of the amino acid module in the seed metabolic network. The study highlights the added value of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping to reveal important regulatory mechanisms in seed metabolism.

    **Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of metabolite profiling and network analysis in elucidating the genetic basis of natural variability in seed primary metabolism and its response to environmental perturbations. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of seed metabolism and its relationship with fruit metabolism, and highlight the importance of amino acids in the seed metabolic network.

    **Title:** Structural and Functional Insights into the N-acetylglucosamine Binding Protein (GbpA) of Vibrio cholerae

    **Research Question:** How does the N-acetylglucosamine binding protein (GbpA) of Vibrio cholerae mediate attachment to both marine chitin and mammalian intestinal mucin?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of structural biology techniques, including X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, to determine the three-dimensional structure of GbpA. We also performed glycan screening, structure-guided GbpA truncation mutants, and in vivo complementation studies to investigate the molecular mechanism of GbpA-mediated attachment.

    **Main Findings:** Our structural studies revealed that GbpA possesses an unusual, elongated, four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. Glycan screening revealed that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides. Structure-guided GbpA truncation mutants showed that domains 1 and 4 of GbpA interact with chitin in vitro, whereas in vivo complementation studies revealed that domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial binding studies showed that domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface. Mouse virulence assays demonstrated that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a molecular explanation for how GbpA mediates interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons. The modular structure of GbpA allows it to bind to different types of GlcNAc oligomers and polymers, enabling the bacterium to colonize both marine and mammalian hosts.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular properties governing GbpA's ability to mediate interactions between V. cholerae and host surfaces. Our findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat V. cholerae infections.

    **Title:** Activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T Cells Compromise Treg-Mediated Suppression in Pulmonary Tuberculosis

    **Background:** Chronic T cell activation is a hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Regulatory T cells (Treg) control T effector cells (Teff), but in PTB, Teff cells are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression.

    **Research Question:** What mechanisms underlie the resistance of Teff cells to Treg suppression in PTB?

    **Methods:** We analyzed circulating Treg and Teff cells from adults with PTB and found that Treg cells preserved their suppressive potential, but Teff cells were resistant to Treg-mediated suppression. We identified an activated Teff subset expressing Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR, which was resistant to Treg suppression.

    **Main Findings:** Comparative transcriptome analysis of Teff cells with and without HLA-DR+ cells revealed putative resistance mechanisms linked to IFNG, IL17A, IL22, PD-L1, and β-chemokines CCL3L3, CCL4 expression. Antibody blocking experiments confirmed that HLA-DR+ Teff cells, but not the fraction depleted of HLA-DR+ effectors, were resistant to Treg suppression mediated via CCR5 and PD-L1 associated pathways.

    **Implications:** Our study provides novel insight into how activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells may contribute to disease-associated inflammation by compromising Treg-mediated suppression in PTB. This is consistent with the emerging paradigm that TB pathology is associated with T cell immune activation.

    **Conclusions:** Our data identify HLA-DR+ Teff cells resistant to Treg suppression as a potential functional marker of disease, with implications for disease monitoring and response to therapy. We provide unequivocal data showing that circulating HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells resistant to CCR5 and PD-L1 mediated suppression compromise regulatory T cell function in tuberculosis. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the complex interplay between Treg and Teff cells in the pathogenesis of PTB.

    **Title:** Adaptation of Prion Strains to Anchorless Prion Protein in GPI-Deficient Mice

    **Research Question:** Can prion strains adapt to and propagate in the absence of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which normally links the prion protein (PrPC) to the cell membrane?

    **Methods:** We investigated the propagation of RML, ME7, and 22L prion strains in mice expressing PrPC without a GPI anchor (tgGPI- mice). We used the Cell Panel Assay (CPA) to determine the cell tropism of the resulting isolates and quantified the levels of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (PrPres) using a sandwich assay.

    **Main Findings:** We found that RML and ME7 prions propagated in tgGPI- mice developed novel cell tropisms, whereas 22L prions did not. Surprisingly, the levels of PrPres in RML- or ME7-infected tgGPI- brain were 25-50 times higher than in wild-type brain. When returned to wild-type brain, ME7 prions recovered their original properties, but RML prions gave rise to a novel prion strain, designated SFL, which remained unchanged even after three passages in wild-type mice.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the absence of the GPI anchor allows prion strains to adapt to and propagate in a novel environment, leading to the emergence of new prion strains. The high levels of PrPres in tgGPI- mice may be due to the greater stability of extracellular PrPres compared to intracellular PrPres.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that the two conformations of RML PrPSc and SFL PrPSc are separated by a high activation energy barrier, which is abrogated in tgGPI- mice. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of prion biology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prion diseases.

    Title: Deciphering the BMP-Responsive Transcriptional Network during Dorsal-Ventral Axis Patterning in Drosophila Embryos

    Background: The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. In Drosophila, graded BMP signaling is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. Despite progress in understanding the Dorsal gene regulatory network, the transcriptional responses downstream of BMP signaling in the dorsal ectoderm remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the transcriptional network underpinning differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-ventral axis patterning in response to BMP signaling in Drosophila embryos?

    Methods: We combined RNA-seq with Mad and Brinker ChIP-seq to investigate the BMP-responsive transcriptional network in the early Drosophila embryo. We identified multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling, and manipulated EGF signaling levels using loss- and gain-of-function studies.

    Main Findings: We found that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription and that the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property, establishing a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning. We also identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions.

    Implications: Our study reveals a complex interplay between BMP and EGF signaling pathways during dorsal-ventral axis patterning in Drosophila embryos. The identification of new BMP target genes and the role of insulator proteins in regulating BMP-dependent transcription provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying dorsal ectoderm differentiation.

    Conclusions: Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the BMP-responsive transcriptional network during dorsal-ventral axis patterning in Drosophila embryos. The self-regulating property of the BMP gene network and the interplay with EGF signaling pathway have implications for our understanding of BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates. This study contributes to the development of a model for Mad-dependent activation and highlights the importance of insulator proteins in regulating BMP-dependent transcription.
Title: Investigating the Evolution and Spread of Leishmania major in Tunisia: A Multi-Locus Microsatellite Typing Study

    Abstract:

    Background: Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major has been increasing in Tunisia, spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center. To understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major, we conducted a multi-locus microsatellite typing study of human isolates from three endemic governorates (Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid) collected over two periods: 1991-1992 and 2008-2012.

    Methods: We analyzed the genotyping results of isolates from Sidi Bouzid collected in both periods using F-statistics and a Bayesian model-based approach. We also compared the genetic patterns of isolates from the three governorates between 2008-2012 to investigate the spread of L. major.

    Main Findings: Our results show that L. major populations in Sidi Bouzid evolved over two decades, generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, suggesting that human activities may be the source of the disease expansion. The genotype analysis also reveals previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts.

    Implications: Our study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia, which may improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations. The findings suggest that human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes may explain the progression of the disease.

    Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of considering human activities and environmental changes in understanding the spread of L. major in Tunisia. The results of this study may contribute to the development of effective control strategies for ZCL in the region.
Title: Evaluating the Impact of Helminth Protective Packages on Infection Prevalence in HIV-Infected Adults: A Cohort Study in Kenya

    Abstract:

    Background: Current global helminth control guidelines focus on regular deworming of targeted populations for morbidity control. However, the role of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helminth transmission remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of different helminth protective packages on infection prevalence, including repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel with and without WASH access.

    Methods: We conducted a cohort study nested within a randomized trial of empiric deworming of HIV-infected adults in Kenya. Helminth infections and infection intensity were diagnosed using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. We used a manual forward stepwise model building approach to identify packages of interventions that may be protective against an STH infection of any species (combined outcome) and each helminth species individually.

    Main Findings: Approximately 22% of the 701 stool samples provided were helminth-infected, most of which were of low to moderate intensity. The odds of infection with any STH species were lower for individuals treated with albendazole (aOR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.20, p < 0.001), adjusting for age and sex. Although most WASH conditions demonstrated minimal additional benefit in reducing the probability of infection with any STH species, access to safe flooring appeared to offer some additional protection (aOR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.56, p < 0.001). For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was protective (aOR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60, p = 0.001).

    Implications: Deworming is effective in reducing the probability of helminth infections among HIV-infected adults. With the exception of safe flooring, WASH offers minimal additional benefit. However, WASH does appear to significantly reduce infection prevalence in adults who are not treated with chemotherapy.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of deworming in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults. While WASH interventions may not offer significant additional benefits in this population, access to safe flooring appears to provide some protection against STH infections. These findings have important implications for the development of effective helminth control strategies in resource-limited settings.
Title: Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Lectin-like Bacteriocins: A Structural and Functional Analysis of LlpABW from Pseudomonas putida

    Abstract:

    Background: Lectin-like bacteriocins, produced by plant-associated bacteria, have been shown to selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their bactericidal activity remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: What is the structural and functional basis of the bacteriocidal activity of LlpABW, a prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida?

    Methods: We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of LlpABW, which revealed a unique architecture consisting of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical assays were used to investigate the functional importance of the sugar-binding pocket in the C-terminal MMBL domain and the role of the N-terminal MMBL domain in target specificity.

    Main Findings: Our structural analysis revealed that the C-terminal MMBL domain adopts a fold similar to MMBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides. Mutational analysis demonstrated that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. In contrast, the N-terminal MMBL domain, which adopts the same fold but lacks a functional mannose-binding site, determines target specificity. Engineered N/C-domain chimeras derived from two LlpA homologues with different killing spectra confirmed that the N-domain plays a key role in target recognition.

    Implications: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the bacteriocidal activity of LlpABW and suggest that this bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity.

    Conclusions: The structural and functional analysis of LlpABW from Pseudomonas putida reveals a unique mechanism of action, where the C-terminal MMBL domain is responsible for bactericidal activity, while the N-terminal MMBL domain determines target specificity. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution and function of lectin-like bacteriocins and have implications for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.

    **Title:** Unveiling the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ Complex: A Novel Secretion Apparatus Essential for Forespore Integrity during Bacillus subtilis Sporulation

    **Research Question:** How is the forespore transcription factor σG regulated during Bacillus subtilis sporulation, and what is the role of the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex in maintaining forespore integrity?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical, and genetic approaches to investigate the regulation of σG and the function of the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex during B. subtilis sporulation.

    **Main Findings:** We discovered that the SpoIIIA proteins, encoded in the spoIIIA operon, and the forespore protein SpoIIQ form a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore. This complex is essential for maintaining forespore integrity, as its absence leads to large invaginations and collapse of the forespore. Notably, the ATPase motifs in SpoIIIAA are required for σG activity and proper forespore morphology. Furthermore, we found that the SpoIIIA proteins share similarity with components of type II and IV secretion systems, suggesting a novel secretion apparatus that links the mother cell and forespore.

    **Implications:** Our findings support a model in which the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex forms a novel secretion apparatus that allows the mother cell to nurture the forespore, thereby maintaining forespore physiology and σG activity during spore maturation. This complex appears to have been cobbled together from components of specialized secretion systems found in Gram-negative bacteria.

    **Conclusions:** The SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex plays a crucial role in maintaining forespore integrity during B. subtilis sporulation. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of σG and the function of the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex, shedding light on the complex interplay between the mother cell and forespore during spore maturation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sporulation in B. subtilis and potentially other Gram-positive bacteria.
Title: Elucidating the Genetic Architecture of Bipolar Disorder: A Genome-Wide Association Study and Meta-Analysis Approach

Abstract:

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable and debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the global population. Despite its significant impact, the genetic underpinnings of BD have remained elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1,190 cases and 401 controls from the Bipolar Genome Study (BiGS) and an additional 1,001 cases and 1,033 controls from the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) initiative. Our results did not yield genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, we observed a significant association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous GWAS and evidence for replication (P = 1.5 × 10−7). This finding suggests that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies.

To validate this result, we analyzed replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and demonstrated that associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Furthermore, we found that SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies and highlight the importance of considering the power to detect effects in the context of GWAS.

Our study contributes to the understanding of the genetic architecture of BD and provides a novel approach for identifying replicable genetic signals in circumscribed regions of the genome. By leveraging the relationship between power and replication, we demonstrate that larger studies can uncover common genetic variation associated with BD near exons. These findings have significant implications for the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for BD.

    **Title:** Elucidating Cancer Proliferation Mechanisms through a Genome-Wide Analysis of Gene Expression and Growth Rate Measurements

    **Research Question:** What are the key genes and cellular processes associated with cancer proliferation, and how do they differ from those involved in non-cancerous proliferation?

    **Methods:** We employed a novel approach to quantify the association between gene expression levels and growth rate measurements across 60 cancer cell lines, assigning a Cancer Proliferation Index (cPI) to each gene. We also analyzed a dataset of 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines to compare cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation indices (nPI).

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that genes essential for cancer proliferation exhibit significant positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors exhibit significant negative cPI values. We identified cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production-related processes as positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration is negatively associated with it. A cross-species comparison revealed that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, whereas non-cancerous proliferation does not. Furthermore, we found that combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures enhances the prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer.

    **Implications:** Our results highlight the inherent differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants, which may contribute to the development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs. The identification of genes involved in translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins provides new targets for cancer therapy.

    **Conclusions:** This study presents the first genome-wide analysis of cancer proliferation based on gene expression and growth rate measurements. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the genes and cellular processes associated with cancer proliferation, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of this complex process. The results of this study have significant implications for the development of novel cancer therapies and may lead to improved patient outcomes.
Title: Cardiovascular Cystic Echinococcosis: A 15-Year Retrospective Case Series of 11 Patients with Cardiac and/or Endovascular Involvement

    Abstract:

    Background: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease that can affect various organs, including the heart and vena cava. However, cardiac and endovascular involvement is rare and poorly understood.

    Research Question: What are the clinical manifestations, complications, and outcomes of patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE?

    Methods: A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE was conducted over a 15-year period (1995-2009). Patients underwent echocardiography, serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and histology for diagnosis and follow-up. Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery, and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment.

    Main Findings: The most common clinical manifestations were thoracic pain and dyspnea, although two patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were primarily located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients had disseminated CE, and one patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination. Two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement exclusively did not experience complications after surgery and were considered cured. In contrast, patients with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolism and presented multiple complications.

    Implications: Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications, and clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated cardiac CE may be cured after surgery, while endovascular extracardiac involvement is associated with severe chronic complications.

    Conclusions: This case series highlights the importance of including CE in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas. The heterogeneity of cardiovascular CE requires a standardized therapeutic approach, which may involve a combination of medical and surgical treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications and improve patient outcomes.

    **Title:** TirS, a Staphylococcus aureus TIR Mimic, Modulates Eukaryotic Innate Immune Signaling and Attenuates Virulence

    **Research Question:** What is the role of TirS, a Staphylococcus aureus TIR mimic, in modulating eukaryotic innate immune signaling and attenuating virulence during S. aureus infection?

    **Methods:** We investigated the effects of TirS on eukaryotic innate immune signaling using ectopic expression in eukaryotic cells and a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection. We also analyzed the localization of TirS in different Staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) and its association with fusidic acid resistance.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that TirS inhibits TLR signaling, downregulating the NF-κB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. Skin lesions induced by the S. aureus knockout tirS mutant increased in a mouse model compared to wild-type and restored strains, despite similar bacterial loads. TirS was also associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, confirming its role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that TirS modulates an inflammatory response at the site of infection through the MyD88 adaptor protein, which is essential for Toll/IL-1 receptor family signaling. The sub-inhibitory concentration of fusidic acid increased TirS expression, and epidemiological studies identified a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS.

    **Conclusions:** TirS, a Staphylococcus aureus TIR mimic, plays a crucial role in modulating eukaryotic innate immune signaling and attenuating virulence during S. aureus infection. The localization of TirS in different SCC elements and its association with fusidic acid resistance suggest a link between two key traits determining the success and spread of bacterial infections. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of S. aureus pathogenicity and highlight the potential of TirS as a target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against S. aureus infections.

    Title: Temporal Gene Expression Clustering Reveals Evolutionary Innovations in Dipteran Embryogenesis

    Research Question: What are the whole-genome changes in gene expression underlying differences in embryonic morphologies between the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae)?

    Methods: We analyzed transcriptional datasets collected during embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae to identify whole-genome changes in gene expression. Orthologous gene pairs were clustered based on the presence of coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles.

    Main Findings: We found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on the presence of coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles. One such cluster contained genes expressed specifically in the mosquito serosa, which is redeployed later in development at the time of cuticle synthesis. Additionally, we observed a striking difference in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes, with maternal transcripts exhibiting a sharp reduction at the time of the maternal-zygotic transition in Drosophila displaying sustained expression in the Anopheles embryo.

    Implications: Our study provides a conceptual and computational framework for cross-organismal temporal alignments and comparisons of species-specific transcriptional datasets. The resulting heatmaps of discordant gene clusters identified distinctive patterning properties in Dipteran embryos, including the organization of extra-embryonic tissues and the maternal-zygotic transition.

    Conclusions: We propose that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be used for the de novo identification of the gene batteries underlying morphological diversity. This approach can be used to extract functional gene sets from comparative datasets, providing insights into the evolutionary innovations driving differences in embryonic morphologies between species. Our study highlights the importance of considering temporal changes in gene expression in understanding the evolution of developmental processes. By applying this approach to other species, we can gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of morphological diversity and its evolutionary origins.
Title: Detection of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA in Asymptomatic Individuals, Flies, and Environmental Surfaces in a Yaws-Endemic Setting

    Abstract:

    Background: Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue are major causes of leg ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific Region. This study aimed to investigate the presence of DNA from these bacteria in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens in an endemic setting.

    Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural villages of Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, during a yaws elimination campaign. Asymptomatic participants were recruited from households with and without cases of leg ulcers. Swabs were collected from the skin of asymptomatic individuals, flies, and environmental surfaces, and tested by PCR for H. ducreyi and T. p. pertenue DNA.

    Main Findings: Of 78 asymptomatic participants, 16 (21%) had H. ducreyi-PCR positivity, and 1 (1%) had T. p. pertenue-PCR positivity. In subgroup analyses, H. ducreyi-PCR positivity did not differ between participants exposed or not exposed to a case of H. ducreyi ulcer in the household. Of 17 cultures obtained from asymptomatic participants, 2 (12%) yielded a definitive diagnosis of H. ducreyi, proving skin colonization. Notably, 9 (90%) of 10 flies tested had H. ducreyi DNA, and 5 (50%) had T. p. pertenue DNA. Additionally, 2 (33%) of 6 bed sheets sampled had H. ducreyi DNA, and 1 (17%) had T. p. pertenue DNA.

    Implications: This study demonstrates the ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment, which is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism. The presence of H. ducreyi DNA on the skin of asymptomatic children and in flies and household linens highlights the need for targeted interventions to prevent transmission.

    Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence of asymptomatic carriage of H. ducreyi DNA on skin and the presence of H. ducreyi and T. p. pertenue DNA in flies and household linens in a yaws-endemic setting. The findings suggest that environmental sources, such as flies and household linens, may play a significant role in the transmission of H. ducreyi and T. p. pertenue.

**Research Question:** What is the current status of bioinformatics core competencies, and how can they be applied in diverse training contexts to meet the needs of various user personas and training programs?

**Methods:** The International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies through a multiyear process of community engagement, including surveys of employers and training programs. This report describes the refined competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating their applications in diverse training contexts.

**Main Findings:** The refined bioinformatics core competencies provide a framework for training needs and curricula that cut across many user personas and training programs. The competencies are not a prescription for a specific set of curricula or curricular standards, but rather a basis for the community of bioinformatics educators to draw upon their common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their own training programs. The use cases presented highlight a diverse set of training needs, user personas, types of training programs, and educational settings, demonstrating the versatility of the core competencies.

**Implications:** The refined bioinformatics core competencies have the potential to assist educators in the domain by providing a conceptual framework for sharing experiences and pooling efforts in identifying best practices for bioinformatics education. The use cases illustrate how the competencies can be applied to define, refine, or assess bioinformatics training mechanisms, making them a valuable resource for the bioinformatics community.

**Conclusions:** The development and refinement of bioinformatics core competencies represent a significant step towards standardizing bioinformatics education and training. The use cases presented in this report demonstrate the applicability of the competencies in diverse training contexts, underscoring their potential to facilitate collaboration and innovation in bioinformatics education. As the field continues to evolve, the core competencies will require ongoing refinement and application to meet the changing needs of the bioinformatics community.

    **Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of L3i Development in Strongyloides stercoralis: A Comparative Analysis with Caenorhabditis elegans

    **Research Question:** What are the molecular pathways involved in the developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3i) of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, and how do they compare to those of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans?

    **Methods:** We undertook a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome of S. stercoralis, generating over 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages. We constructed developmental expression profiles for S. stercoralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes identified by BLAST searches of the S. stercoralis genome as well as de novo assembled transcripts.

    **Main Findings:** Our data suggest that genes encoding cGMP pathway components are coordinately up-regulated in L3i, whereas genes encoding insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) ligands show a paucity in S. stercoralis compared to C. elegans. We also identified seven S. stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand, three of which are only expressed in L3i. In contrast to C. elegans, S. stercoralis TGFβ ligands are significantly up-regulated in L3i and down-regulated in activated L3i.

    **Implications:** Our findings indicate that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species. Understanding the mechanisms governing L3i development in S. stercoralis may lead to novel treatment and control strategies for this parasitic nematode, which infects over one billion people globally.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of L3i development in S. stercoralis and highlights the importance of comparative analysis between parasitic and free-living nematodes. Our results suggest that S. stercoralis has a unique set of molecular pathways regulating L3i development, which differ from those of C. elegans. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of L3i development in S. stercoralis and to identify potential targets for intervention.

    **Title:** Bacterial Genotoxins Induce Nuclear Remodeling in Response to Genotoxic Stress

    **Research Question:** How do bacterial genotoxins, such as colibactin and Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT), affect nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival in response to genotoxic stress?

    **Methods:** This study employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including Helicobacter-infected mice, coculture experiments with CDT- and colibactin-secreting bacteria, and xenograft mouse-derived models, to investigate the effects of these genotoxins on nuclear remodeling.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that CDT and colibactin induce the formation of nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR) structures, characterized by deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells. These structures, observed both in vivo and in vitro, concentrate ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the mCRD complex involved in mRNA turnover. These NR structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that bacterial genotoxins-induced NR may serve as a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be transported and translated within the nucleus, allowing the cell to pause and repair DNA damage caused by genotoxic stress. This may contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapies and some chemotherapies inducing DNA damage.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the context of NR formation, a common feature of many cancers, which not only appears in response to therapies-induced DNA damage but also earlier in response to genotoxic bacteria. Our results highlight the complex interplay between bacterial genotoxins, nuclear remodeling, and cell survival, and have significant implications for our understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Title: Quantitative Evaluation of Maxillary Bone Deformities in Leprosy Patients using Three-Dimensional Computed Tomography (3D-CT)

    Abstract:
    Leprosy, a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae, can lead to severe facial deformities, including maxillary bone regression, which has been documented in paleopathological studies of excavated skeletal remains. However, the extent of maxillary bone deformation in living patients with leprosy has been evaluated only subjectively through visual grading. This study aimed to investigate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy using three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) and to compare the findings with those from previous paleopathological studies.

    Methods:
    Ten former patients with leprosy and five control subjects underwent 3D-CT scans, and three-dimensional images centered on the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplanar reconstruction methods. The anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA-P) was measured, and the difference between the MA-P of patients and controls was evaluated after compensating for individual skull size.

    Main Findings:
    Three former patients with lepromatous leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla at the prosthion, which corresponded with the visual appearance of the maxillary deformity. These results were consistent with paleopathological findings of excavated skeletal remains. Additionally, the precise bone defects of the maxilla could be individually calculated for accurate reconstructive surgery.

    Implications:
    This study demonstrates the utility of 3D-CT in evaluating maxillary bone deformities in living patients with leprosy. The use of 3D-CT images enabled easier qualitative evaluation and allowed for the calculation of precise bone defects, which can inform reconstructive surgery. This approach may contribute to novel surgical treatments for facial deformity and eliminate social segregation and prejudice attributed to leprosy.

    Conclusions:
    This study confirms the maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies and demonstrates the potential of 3D-CT in evaluating maxillary bone deformities in living patients with leprosy. Further analysis using a larger number of samples is needed to validate these findings, but this methodology represents a promising tool for the quantitative evaluation of maxillary deformities associated with leprosy and other maxillary lesions.

    **Title:** Noise-Invariant Sound Representations in the Auditory System: The Role of Adaptation to Stimulus Statistics

    **Research Question:** Can the auditory system represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion by adapting to stimulus statistics, and if so, how does this adaptation contribute to the construction of noise-invariant sound representations along the auditory pathway?

    **Methods:** We investigated the extent of neuronal adaptation to the mean and contrast of auditory stimulation in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets. We presented complex synthetic and natural sounds, recorded neuronal responses, and compared these responses with a sophisticated model of the auditory nerve. We also used a decoding approach to assess the noise tolerance of the neuronal population code.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the strength of both forms of adaptation increases as one ascends the auditory pathway. We found that the code for complex sounds in the periphery is affected more by the addition of noise than the cortical code. Moreover, noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation to stimulus statistics, suggesting that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that adaptation to stimulus statistics is a neural mechanism that drives the construction of noise-tolerant representations of sound. As neurons' adaptation to stimulus statistics gradually grows stronger along the auditory pathway, populations of these neurons progressively shift from encoding low-level physical attributes of incoming sounds towards more mean-, contrast-, and noise-independent information about stimulus identity. This result is a major computational step towards the context-invariant, categorical sound representations seen in higher areas of the auditory cortex.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the auditory system can represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion by adapting to stimulus statistics. The increase in adaptation to sound statistics from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how the auditory system processes complex sounds in the presence of background noise.

    **Title:** Reorganization of the Yeast Interactome in Response to Heat Shock: A System-Level Adaptation Mechanism

    **Research Question:** How does the yeast interactome reorganize in response to heat shock, and what are the implications of this reorganization for our understanding of cellular behavior under stress?

    **Methods:** We used a network analysis approach to investigate the changes in the yeast interactome (protein-protein interaction network) in response to heat shock. We calculated the weight of each protein-protein interaction in both unstressed and heat-shocked yeast cells using mRNA expression data from the BioGRID database.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that heat shock induces a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules, leading to a 4.9-fold increase in the weighted diameter of the yeast interactome. Several key proteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local communities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules after heat shock.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that heat shock induces a partial disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome, which may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes in other complex systems, such as single proteins, social networks, and ecosystems.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the reorganization of the yeast interactome in response to heat shock, revealing a "stratus-cumulus" type transition from a globally connected to a multifocal organization. This change may be a non-trivial adaptation to stress at the system level, rather than an obvious consequence of heat shock-induced mRNA changes. Our results have implications for our understanding of cellular behavior under stress and may provide a model for understanding system-level adaptation mechanisms in other complex systems.

    **Key Takeaways:**

    * Heat shock induces a significant reorganization of the yeast interactome, leading to a partial disintegration of the global organization.
    * Several key proteins of the heat shock response become centers of heat shock-induced local communities and bridges providing a residual connection of modules after heat shock.
    * This reorganization may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes in other complex systems.

    **Future Directions:** Further studies are needed to investigate the universality of this adaptation mechanism and its implications for understanding cellular behavior under stress.
Title: Efficacy and Safety of Amiodarone in Patients with Chagas Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

    Abstract:

    Background: Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected chronic condition with high prevalence and burden in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone has been widely used for this purpose.

    Research Question: What is the efficacy and safety of amiodarone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy?

    Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies evaluating amiodarone use in Chagas cardiomyopathy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to January 2018 and included 9 studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized controlled trial). Two reviewers selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the overall quality of evidence.

    Main Findings: Amiodarone reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes in 99.9% (95% CI 99.8-100%), ventricular premature beats in 93.1% (95% CI 82-97.4%), and the incidence of ventricular couplets in 79% (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11-0.39). Amiodarone was associated with corneal microdeposits (61.1%, 95% CI 19.0-91.3), gastrointestinal events (16.1%, 95% CI 6.61-34.2), sinus bradycardia (12.7%, 95% CI 3.71-35.5), dermatological events (10.6%, 95% CI 4.77-21.9), and drug discontinuation (7.68%, 95% CI 4.17-13.7).

    Implications: Our findings suggest that amiodarone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, but there is no evidence for hard endpoints (sudden death, hospitalization). The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low.

    Conclusions: Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic drug for patients with Chagas disease, reducing uncomfortable symptoms such as palpitations and potentially fatal events related to ventricular tachycardia. However, it is essential to balance the potential benefits and harms at the individual level for decision-making. Future studies, such as the ongoing CHAGASICS trial, are needed to provide direct evidence for the benefits and risks of amiodarone use in Chagas patients.

    **Title:** Seasonal Patterns of Dengue Fever in Rural Ecuador: A Longitudinal Study of Climatic and Non-Climatic Factors

    **Research Question:** What are the short- and long-term seasonal patterns of dengue fever in rural Ecuador, and how do climatic and non-climatic factors influence disease rates and healthcare-seeking behavior?

    **Methods:** We analyzed 2009-2016 medical record data from two hospitals in rural Ecuador using Poisson generalized linear modeling. We decomposed seasonality into two components: non-climatic seasonality (short- and long-term trends, day of the week, public holidays, and school schedules) and climate-driven seasonality.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends, day of the week, and hospital were the most important predictors of dengue fever. Seasonal trends revealed single peaks in case diagnoses during mid-March. Compared to the average of all days, cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. In the climate model, important climate variables included monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days.

    **Implications:** These findings can inform local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, and global and regional models of dengue fever trends. The results highlight the importance of considering both climatic and non-climatic factors in understanding seasonal patterns of dengue fever.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides the first report of long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador, one of few reports from rural patients, and one of very few studies utilizing daily disease reports. Our results demonstrate the complex interplay between climatic and non-climatic factors influencing dengue fever rates and healthcare-seeking behavior, underscoring the need for a comprehensive approach to disease prevention and control.

    **Title:** Augmenting Innate Immunity via Transgenic Expression of Picornavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) for Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Protection

    **Research Question:** Can transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity without triggering harmful autoimmunity or chronic inflammatory sequelae?

    **Methods:** We generated transgenic mice expressing RdRP in the absence of other viral proteins and assessed their innate immune response to viral challenge. We also performed multiple crosses with defined knockout mice to elucidate the molecular mechanism of RdRP-mediated antiviral immunity. Human cell models were used to recapitulate the key features of RdRP-mediated antiviral immunity.

    **Main Findings:** RdRP-transgenic mice exhibited a life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and showed profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. The mechanism of RdRP-mediated antiviral immunity was found to operate via MDA5 and MAVS and was fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features of RdRP-mediated antiviral immunity, inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection.

    **Implications:** Our data reveal that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. This finding provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that transgenic expression of RdRP can profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity without triggering harmful autoimmunity or chronic inflammatory sequelae. The RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis, but does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. These results have significant implications for the development of novel antiviral therapies that can provide broad-spectrum protection against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

    **Title:** Testing the Independent Action Hypothesis in Plant RNA Virus Infection: A Study on Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV)

    **Research Question:** Does the independent action hypothesis (IAH) accurately describe the infection process of plant RNA viruses, specifically Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV), and is the effective population size (Ne) of TEV dose-dependent?

    **Methods:** We conducted an experimental study using TEV variants carrying fluorescent markers (GFP or mCherry) to infect Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Capsicum annuum (pepper) plants at different doses. We analyzed the number of primary infection foci, the frequency of mixed-genotype infection, and the probability of systemic infection.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf and systemically infecting the plant was near 1, although in rare cases, genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from the mean number of primary infection foci using the IAH model.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the IAH holds for TEV, indicating that Ne is dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, approaching 1 at low doses. This has significant implications for experimental evolution with plant viruses, as genetic drift can have a tremendous impact on virus populations.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that the IAH applies to plant RNA viruses, specifically TEV, and that Ne is dose-dependent. These findings have important implications for understanding the infection biology of plant RNA viruses and highlight the need to consider dose effects when comparing Ne estimates across different viruses. Future studies should investigate the generality of the IAH in other plant RNA viruses and explore the factors contributing to variation in Ne estimates.

    **Title:** Integrative Sparse Bayesian Regression Models for Mapping Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) Across Multiple Tissues

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a novel statistical framework to simultaneously analyze gene expression across multiple tissues and identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using sparse Bayesian regression models?

    **Methods:** We propose a novel approach that combines sparse Bayesian regression models with an efficient computational algorithm (Evolutionary Stochastic Search, ESS) to identify eQTLs within individual tissues and across multiple tissues. We applied this method to a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues and compared its performance with traditional approaches.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems-level. We identified a two-eQTL model (cis/trans) for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and not detected by conventional approaches. Furthermore, we showed that approximately 27% of transcripts exhibit common genetic regulation across four tissues, leading to a >5-fold increase in eQTL detection compared to single-tissue analyses at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) level.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a new opportunity to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling global gene expression. The generality of our modeling approach makes it adaptable to other model systems and humans, with broad application to analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes.

    **Conclusions:** We have shown that our Sparse Bayesian Regression models coupled with ESS provide significant advantages over other methods in eQTL mapping within and across multiple tissues. Our approach is capable of uncovering polygenic regulation of gene expression, with greater power to identify secondary trans-eQTLs than traditional methods. The proposed method has the potential to revolutionize the field of eQTL analysis, enabling the discovery of novel genetic regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex traits and diseases.

    **Title:** Unveiling the Variable-Delay, Snap-Action Switch of Extrinsic Apoptosis: A Quantitative Modeling Approach

    **Research Question:** How does the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), control the transition from a protracted delay to a rapid and sudden activation of downstream effector caspases?

    **Methods:** We constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The model was trained against experimental data obtained from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression.

    **Main Findings:** Our model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, allowing us to study the switching mechanisms in detail. We found that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are critical for snap-action control of extrinsic apoptosis. Failure in snap-action switching generates an indeterminate physiological state and sublethal cellular damage that may predispose cells to genomic instability.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides a quantitative understanding of the variable-delay, snap-action switch of extrinsic apoptosis, shedding light on the mechanisms that control the transition from a protracted delay to a rapid and sudden activation of downstream effector caspases. Our findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. Further analysis of more complete models of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and live-cell imaging of additional reactants will help to refine our understanding of how cells reconcile the competing demands of a long pre-MOMP delay and fast dose-independent switching.

    **Title:** InlP, a Secreted Virulence Factor of Listeria monocytogenes, Targets Afadin to Promote Transcytosis Across Epithelial Monolayers

    **Research Question:** How does Listeria monocytogenes breach the placental barrier during pregnancy, and what role does the secreted virulence factor Internalin P (InlP) play in this process?

    **Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical, structural, and cellular biology approaches to investigate the interaction between InlP and human afadin, a protein associated with cell-cell junctions. We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of InlP and assessed its binding to afadin using surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation assays. We also examined the effects of InlP expression on the behavior of MDCK epithelial cells and the ability of L. monocytogenes to cross epithelial monolayers.

    **Main Findings:** We found that InlP, but not the highly similar L. monocytogenes internalin Lmo2027, binds to human afadin, a protein associated with cell-cell junctions. The crystal structure of InlP reveals an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a distinctive Ca2+-binding site. Expression of InlP in MDCK epithelial cells decreased the magnitude of the traction stresses they could exert on deformable substrates, similar to the decrease observed in AF-6 knock-out MDCK cells. L. monocytogenes ΔinlP mutants were deficient in their ability to form actin-rich protrusions from the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, a necessary step in the crossing of such monolayers (transcytosis). A similar phenotype was observed for bacteria expressing an internal in-frame deletion in inlP (inlP ΔLRR5) that specifically disrupts its interaction with afadin.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that secreted InlP targets cytosolic afadin to specifically promote L. monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection. The abundance of afadin in the placenta, combined with our previous report that InlP plays an important role in L. monocytogenes infection at the maternal-fetal interface, are consistent with the hypothesis that InlP-afadin interactions are important for the pathogenesis of placental infections.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which L. monocytogenes breaches the placental barrier during pregnancy, highlighting the importance of InlP-afadin interactions in promoting transcytosis across epithelial monolayers. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of placental infections and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent such infections.

    Title: Comprehensive Analysis of the Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum Proteome Reveals Insights into Pathogenicity and Protein Expression Profiles during Infection

    Background: Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (T. pallidum) is the causative agent of syphilis, a chronic multistage disease. Despite its significance, the global T. pallidum proteome remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the T. pallidum proteome during infection.

    Methods: We analyzed T. pallidum ssp. pallidum DAL-1 strain bacteria isolated from rabbits using multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap) tandem mass spectrometry.

    Main Findings: A total of 6033 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique T. pallidum proteins at a high level of confidence, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. We identified 116 potential membrane proteins, of which 16 have evidence supporting outer membrane localization. Furthermore, we found 8/12 proteins related to the paralogous tpr gene family. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral counting methods, revealing a low correlation (r = 0.26) between previous microarray signal data and protein abundance.

    Implications: These findings provide valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression, paving the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism. The comprehensive description of the T. pallidum proteome will facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for syphilis.

    Conclusions: This study represents a significant advancement in the field of T. pallidum research, providing the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. The findings of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenicity of T. pallidum and will have significant implications for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for syphilis.

**Title:** Conformational Selection in Protein Kinase A (PKA) Regulatory Subunit: A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Study

**Research Question:** How do the tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B) of the Protein Kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit (RIα) dynamically sample conformational states in the absence and presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the catalytic subunit (C)?

**Methods:** We employed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the conformational dynamics of the two-domain construct RIα (91–379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms.

**Main Findings:** Our comparative NMR analyses reveal a double conformational selection model, where each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, selectively stabilizing the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260. The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection but indispensable for full activation of PKA, as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of cAMP-dependent activation of PKA, highlighting the critical role of CBD-B dynamics in modulating the control exerted by CBD-A. The conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics, as the two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that the dynamics of nucleotide-free CBD-B are functionally critical and that apo CBD-B pre-samples both active and inactive conformations, with the binding of cAMP or the C-subunit selecting for the former or the latter, respectively. These findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of PKA activity and its role in various cellular processes, including immune system regulation and cell proliferation.

    **Title:** ISG15 Regulates Mitochondrial Function and Antiviral Immunity in Macrophages

    **Research Question:** What is the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in regulating mitochondrial function and antiviral immunity in macrophages?

    **Methods:** We compared the proteomes of ISG15-/- and ISG15+/+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after vaccinia virus (VACV) infection to identify protein components implicated in interferon (IFN) and ISG15 signaling.

    **Main Findings:** Our analysis revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were pathways altered in ISG15-/- BMDM treated with IFN. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in ISG15+/+ BMDM than in ISG15-/- BMDM following IFN treatment. We also observed a significant change in macrophage polarization, with ISG15-/- macrophages showing a proinflammatory cytokine expression pattern typical of an M1 phenotype, but with a blockade of nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation.

    **Implications:** Our results demonstrate that ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy, broadening its physiological role as an antiviral agent. The collapse of mitochondrial stability and macrophage polarization in ISG15-/- BMDM corresponded with an advantage for viral replication, indicating that ISG15 plays a crucial role in regulating antiviral immunity.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of ISG15 in regulating mitochondrial function and antiviral immunity in macrophages. The findings suggest that ISG15-dependent mechanisms are essential for the induction of OXPHOS and mitophagy, which are critical for cellular homeostasis and antiviral defense. The results also indicate that ISG15 modulates macrophage polarization, which is dependent on cellular metabolism. Overall, our study provides new insights into the role of ISG15 in regulating mitochondrial function and antiviral immunity, and highlights its potential as a target for the development of novel antiviral therapies.

    **Title:** Differential Phosphorylation of HIV-1 Viral Protein U (Vpu) Regulates Its Fate as an Adaptor or Substrate of Distinct Ubiquitin Ligases

    **Research Question:** How does the viral protein U (Vpu) of HIV-1 regulate its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases, and what are the implications for HIV-1 replication?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of Vpu in HIV-1 replication, focusing on its interaction with the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex and its effect on the degradation of cellular targets such as β-catenin, IκBα, Emi1, and Cdc25A. We also examined the role of a novel phosphorylation site in Vpu, serine 61, in regulating its degradation.

    **Main Findings:** We found that Vpu binds βTrCP and acts as an adaptor between the SCFβTrCP and CD4, leading to the degradation of the HIV-1 receptor. However, Vpu undergoes phosphorylation of serine 61, which triggers its degradation by a βTrCP-independent process. Mutation of Vpu S61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the half-life of the protein and significantly increases the release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells.

    **Implications:** Our results highlight a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The conservation of the Vpu degradation determinant, despite its negative effect on virion release, argues for a role in overall HIV-1 fitness.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the regulation of Vpu and its role in HIV-1 replication. The phosphorylation of Vpu serine 61 is a critical event that determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The conservation of this phosphorylation site in HIV-1 isolates suggests that it plays a crucial role in HIV-1 fitness. These findings have important implications for our understanding of HIV-1 replication and the development of new therapeutic strategies to target Vpu.
Title: Coordinating Tissue Patterning with Whole-Body Development in Drosophila Melanogaster

    Abstract:

    Background: The development of correctly patterned tissues is essential for the formation of a robust adult phenotype. However, the mechanisms underlying the coordination of tissue patterning with whole-body development remain poorly understood.

    Research Question: How is tissue patterning coordinated with whole-body development in Drosophila melanogaster?

    Methods: We developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae based on the expression of canonical patterning genes and linked it to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupariation. We used this scheme to explore how the progression of pattern changes when developmental time is altered either by changing temperature or by altering the timing of hormone synthesis that drives developmental progression.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligns at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these key developmental events represent milestones. Between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. Furthermore, our data showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting that wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone.

    Implications: Our findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. This suggests that developmental milestones play a crucial role in coordinating tissue patterning with whole-body development.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the coordination of tissue patterning with whole-body development in Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that developmental milestones, such as moulting and pupariation, are critical for ensuring the robustness of the adult phenotype by coordinating tissue patterning with whole-body development. These findings have important implications for our understanding of developmental biology and the evolution of developmental robustness.

    **Title:** ESCRT Regulator Did2 Coordinates Endosomal Transport in Fungal Hyphae

    **Research Question:** How does the ESCRT regulator Did2 contribute to endosomal transport in highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae?

    **Methods:** We investigated the role of Did2 in endosomal transport in Ustilago maydis fungal hyphae using a combination of molecular biology, cell biology, and microscopy techniques.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that loss of Did2 leads to defective vacuolar targeting, reduced processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. We also observed increased shuttling of late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 on aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Furthermore, molecular motors failed to attach efficiently, explaining the disturbed processive movement. Additionally, we found that the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 was hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport.

    **Implications:** Our study reveals that the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes and provides the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. This is essential for undisturbed unipolar growth of hyphae, suggesting a functional role in microtubule-dependent transport.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the crosstalk between endocytosis and long-distance transport in highly polarized cells. We demonstrate that Did2 is not only required for endocytic functions such as vacuolar sorting but also essential for efficient long-distance transport. The precise membrane identity of early endosomes, guaranteed by Did2, is crucial for the correct function of endosomes in transporting various cargos, including mRNAs and septins. Our study highlights the importance of ESCRT components in endosomal maturation and long-distance transport, and provides a molecular link between ESCRT complex and endosomal mRNA transport.

    Title: Divergent Ligand Binding Properties and Regulatory Mechanisms of Adenine Riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus

    Background: Riboswitches are ligand-binding elements that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or translational level. Adenine riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Vibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus) differ in their regulatory mechanisms, with B. subtilis controlling transcription and V. vulnificus controlling translation.

    Research Question: What are the ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms of adenine riboswitches in B. subtilis and V. vulnificus?

    Methods: We investigated the ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms of adenine riboswitches in B. subtilis and V. vulnificus using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches.

    Main Findings: Our results demonstrate that both adenine riboswitches exhibit different ligand binding properties and operate under different regulation regimes (kinetic versus thermodynamic). The B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, whereas the V. vulnificus add riboswitch can bind to adenine after transcription is completed and still regulate translation. Furthermore, we found that the rate of transcription is critical for the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch to perform efficiently, consistent with a co-transcriptional regulation.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the nature of gene regulation control (transcription or translation) has a significant impact on riboswitch regulatory mechanisms. The results also highlight the importance of considering the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of riboswitches in understanding their regulatory mechanisms.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms of adenine riboswitches in B. subtilis and V. vulnificus. The findings have implications for our understanding of riboswitch-mediated gene regulation in bacteria and highlight the importance of considering the specific regulatory mechanisms employed by different riboswitches.

    **Title:** Primer-Dependent Initiation (PDI) as a Regulatory Mechanism in Bacteria: A Comparative Analysis of E. coli and Vibrio cholerae

    **Research Question:** What is the physiological role of Primer-Dependent Initiation (PDI) in E. coli and V. cholerae, and to what extent does PDI occur in other bacteria?

    **Methods:** We employed high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5′ ends (5′ RNA-seq) and primer extension analyses to investigate PDI in E. coli and V. cholerae. We also used a modified 5′ RNA-seq protocol to detect PDI in V. cholerae.

    **Main Findings:** Our results demonstrate that PDI is a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation in E. coli. We found that PDI is detected in late stationary phase, but not in exponential phase, and is preferentially apparent at promoters carrying the sequence T−1A+1 or G−1G+1. Furthermore, we detected PDI in V. cholerae, a pathogenic Gammaproteobacterium, and found that the pattern of PDI is strikingly similar to that observed in E. coli.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that PDI may be widespread among Gammaproteobacteria and that the extent of PDI relative to de novo initiation fluctuates as a function of growth state. We propose that a growth phase-dependent process leads to the preferential generation of the linear dinucleotides 5′-UA-3′ and 5′-GG-3′ in both E. coli and V. cholerae.

    **Conclusions:** Our study establishes a physiological role for PDI in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism involved in biofilm growth and demonstrates that PDI occurs in the pathogenic bacterium V. cholerae. The similarity in PDI patterns between E. coli and V. cholerae suggests that PDI may be a conserved mechanism among Gammaproteobacteria. Our findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression in bacteria and the role of PDI in bacterial physiology.

    **Title:** Parental Genome Dosage Imbalance Deregulates Imprinting in Arabidopsis thaliana

    **Research Question:** How does parental genome dosage imbalance affect the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, and do these effects support the parental conflict theory?

    **Methods:** We investigated the impact of parental genome dosage imbalance on the expression of four imprinted genes in Arabidopsis thaliana: FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2), FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA), MEDEA (MEA), and PHERES1 (PHE1). We used DNA methylation and histone methylation to control the expression of these genes.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates the expression of FIS2 and PHE1 in an antagonistic manner. Increased dosage of inactive alleles caused a loss of imprinting of FIS2 and MEA. However, the changes in PHE1 and MEA expression could not be fully accounted for by the corresponding fluctuations of FIS2 expression.

    **Implications:** These findings suggest that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms independent from known regulators of imprinting. The complexity of the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes activated in response to parental dosage imbalance does not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis.

    **Conclusions:** Our study provides experimental evidence that parental genome dosage imbalance affects the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The observed non-symmetrical deregulation of imprinted genes and loss of imprinting in two out of four imprinted genes studied suggest that parental genome dosage imbalance may play a role in reproductive isolation between emerging new species. These findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying reproductive barriers and the evolution of new species.

    **Title:** Reverse-Engineering Brain Rhythms: Unveiling Functional Brain Connectivity through Oscillatory Dynamics

    **Research Question:** What information do brain rhythms convey about functional brain connectivity, and how can we reverse-engineer network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains?

    **Methods:** We employed mathematical techniques for inverse problems and stochastic theory to reverse-engineer network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves, which appear in the power spectrum as frequency bands superimposed on a non-oscillatory background dominated by low frequencies.

    **Main Findings:** Our reconstructed networks display similar topological features (e.g., structural motifs) and dynamics, indicating that the power spectrum of neural recordings conveys significant information about the functional, though not necessarily anatomical, connectivity of the brain. We also reverse-engineered putative diseased brains (epileptic and schizophrenic), in which the oscillatory activity is altered in different ways, as reported in clinical studies. These reconstructed networks show consistent alterations of functional connectivity and dynamics.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that the complexity of the network, quantified as proposed by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, is a good indicator of brain fitness, as virtual brains modeling diseased states display lower complexity than virtual brains modeling normal neural function. This finding has significant implications for the neurobiology of health and disease.

    **Conclusions:** By reverse-engineering network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, we demonstrate that the power spectrum of neural recordings conveys significant information about functional brain connectivity. Our results provide new insights into the functional role of brain rhythms and have the potential to inform the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

    **Significance:** This study contributes to our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying brain rhythms and their interactions, and sheds light on the functional aspects of oscillatory brain dynamics. Our findings have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of brain function and dysfunction, and may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Title: Elucidating Population Structure and Genetic Heterogeneity in Hispanic Cohorts: Implications for Genetic Association Studies

    Abstract:
    This study investigates the population structure and genetic heterogeneity of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium. By projecting principal components (PCs) of ancestry onto samples from the HapMap phase III and the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP), we identify the first two PCs as quantifying Caucasian, African, and Native American origins, while the third and fourth PCs reveal a geographic axis separating MESA Mexican versus Central/South American samples. Using k-means clustering, we define four subgroups of the MESA Hispanic cohort that closely align with self-identification: primarily Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican.

    We demonstrate the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies by performing pooled and stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, previously reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanic populations. Our results show statistically significant evidence for genetic association in both genes, underscoring the need for tailored approaches to genetic analysis in diverse populations.

    This study highlights the significance of accounting for population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies, particularly in the United States Hispanic population. Our findings have implications for the design and interpretation of future genetic studies, emphasizing the importance of considering the complex genetic landscape of Hispanic cohorts.

    Title: Elongator Histone Acetyltransferase Regulates Transcriptional Silencing and Genome Stability through Interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)

    Research Question: What is the role of the Elongator histone acetyltransferase in transcriptional silencing and genome stability, and how does it interact with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)?

    Methods: We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator histone acetyltransferase, in budding yeast. We analyzed the effects of elp3 deletion on transcriptional silencing, genome stability, and sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitors and DNA damaging agents.

    Main Findings: Our results show that Elp3 is required for transcriptional silencing at the chromosome VIIL telomere and the HMR locus, and that cells lacking Elp3 are sensitive to the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and the DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We also found that Elp3 interacts with PCNA in vivo and in vitro, and that this interaction is required for S-phase progression in the presence of HU.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the Elongator complex plays a novel role in transcriptional silencing and genome stability, and that this function is linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA. We also show that Elp3 functions in a pathway independent of the histone chaperones Asf1 and CAF-1, and that it has allele-specific genetic interactions with mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA.

    Conclusions: In conclusion, our study reveals a critical role for the Elongator histone acetyltransferase in maintaining genome stability and transcriptional silencing, and highlights the importance of the interaction between Elp3 and PCNA in this process. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of chromatin structure and function, and have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying genome stability and disease.

**Title:** Machine Learning-Assisted Triage for Biomedical Literature Curation: A Deep Learning Approach

**Research Question:** Can a machine learning-assisted triage method improve the efficiency and precision of biomedical literature curation, compared to traditional query-based methods?

**Methods:** We developed a deep learning-based triage method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and rank new publications for curation. We trained the models on a gold-standard dataset of previously curated publications from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog.

**Main Findings:** Our method outperformed current query-based triage methods in both UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, achieving precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher, respectively, without compromising recall. Our method also retrieved many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find.

**Implications:** Our machine learning-assisted triage method can significantly improve the efficiency of the document triage step in biomedical literature curation, allowing human curators to focus on more challenging tasks and improve the quality of knowledge bases.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning-based triage for biomedical literature curation, outperforming traditional query-based methods in terms of precision and recall. Our method can be implemented in production to support the curation of large-scale biomedical knowledge bases, such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog. By automating the triage process, our method can reduce the workload of human curators and enable them to focus on high-value tasks, ultimately improving the quality and accuracy of biomedical knowledge bases.

**Supporting Text:** Our method was evaluated on three different datasets, including publications from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the GWAS Catalog, and mycoSet. Our results show that our method achieved high performance on all datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and GWAS Catalog manual curation teams confirmed that our method achieved higher precision than previous query-based triage methods without compromising recall.
Title: Gain-of-Function Mutations in KCNJ2-Encoded Kir2.1 Channels Underlie Variant 3 (SQT3) of Short QT Syndrome: Mechanistic Insights into Atrial Arrhythmogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Targets

    Abstract:

    Background: Gain-of-function mutations in KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels are associated with variant 3 (SQT3) of the short QT syndrome, which is linked to atrial fibrillation (AF). This study aimed to investigate the mechanistic link between SQT3 mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis using biophysically-detailed human atrial computer models.

    Methods: A contemporary model of the human atrial action potential (AP) was modified to recapitulate functional changes in IK1 due to heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172N and E299V Kir2.1 mutations. Wild-type (WT) and mutant formulations were incorporated into multi-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous tissue models. Effects of mutations on AP duration (APD), conduction velocity (CV), effective refractory period (ERP), tissue excitation threshold, and their rate-dependence, as well as the wavelength of re-entry (WL), were quantified.

    Main Findings: The D172N and E299V Kir2.1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK1 and APD shortening. Both mutations decreased WL for re-entry through a reduction in ERP and CV. Stability of re-entrant excitation waves in 2D and 3D tissue models was mediated by changes to tissue excitability and dispersion of APD in mutation conditions. Combined block of IK1 and IKr was effective in terminating re-entry associated with heterozygous D172N conditions, whereas IKr block alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Combined inhibition of IKr and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3.

    Implications: This study provides mechanistic insights into atrial pro-arrhythmia with SQT3 Kir2.1 mutations and highlights possible pharmacological strategies for management of SQT3-linked AF. The findings suggest that combined inhibition of IKr and IKur may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating SQT3-related AF.

    Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of considering the effects of genetic mutations on human atrial electrophysiology in the context of intrinsic electrical heterogeneities. The results provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying SQT3-related AF and suggest potential therapeutic targets for its management. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.
Title: Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Attenuate Chagasic Cardiomyopathy by Modulating Immune Responses in a Mouse Model of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection

    Abstract:
    Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is a complex disease endemic in Central and South America, with increasing non-vectorial forms of transmission in developed countries. We investigated whether adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can alter the course of the disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and tracked by bioluminescence, showing that cells remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days and migrated to the abdominal or subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 dpi. Cytokine analysis revealed an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals, whereas splenocytes exposed to T. cruzi antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response in placebo and ASC-treated groups. However, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that right ventricular (RV) dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice. Our findings suggest that the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents RV remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, promoting lymphoid organ response to the parasite and protecting the heart from damage due to improved control of inflammation.

    Research Question:
    Can adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) alter the course of Chagas disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy?

    Methods:
    ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 dpi in a mouse model of T. cruzi infection. Bioluminescence tracking showed that cells remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days and migrated to the abdominal or subcutaneous fat.

    Main Findings:
    ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 dpi. Cytokine analysis revealed an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals, whereas splenocytes exposed to T. cruzi antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response in placebo and ASC-treated groups. However, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that RV dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice.

    Implications:
    Our findings suggest that the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection can prevent RV remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, promoting lymphoid organ response to the parasite and protecting the heart from damage due to improved control of inflammation.

    Conclusions:
    This study demonstrates that adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells can alter the course of Chagas disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy by modulating immune responses. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for Chagas disease.

    Title: Optimization of Retrograde Pathway Inhibitors for Enhanced Efficacy against Leishmania Infections

    Background: Leishmania parasites reside within parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs) in infected mammalian cells. Previous studies have shown that Retro-2, a small retrograde pathway inhibitor, reduces LPV sizes and parasite numbers during Leishmania mexicana infections. This study aimed to determine if structural analogs of Retro-2cycl, reported to have superior potency in inhibiting retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena, are more effective than the parent compound at controlling Leishmania infections.

    Methods: We synthesized and evaluated the efficacy of two optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, against Leishmania amazonensis infections in macrophages and axenic cultures.

    Main Findings: Our results show that DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1 exhibit significantly lower EC50 values (13.63+/-2.58μM and 10.57+/-2.66μM, respectively) compared to Retro-2cycl (40.15+/-2.15μM) in suppressing Leishmania infections in macrophages. Moreover, these analogs can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, a desirable attribute for any drug to treat Leishmania infections. Additionally, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1 can induce the reversal of Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation.

    Implications: These findings validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl, demonstrating that optimized analogs can exhibit enhanced efficacy against Leishmania infections. The ability of DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1 to kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures and promote the clearance of parasites from established macrophage infections highlights their potential as lead compounds for the treatment of Leishmaniasis.

    Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, exhibit superior potency and efficacy against Leishmania infections compared to the parent compound. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against Leishmaniasis, a major public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.

    **Title:** Predicting Nucleosome Sensitivity to Transcription Factors: A Novel Approach to Understanding Gene Regulation

    **Research Question:** Can we develop a computational method to predict which transcription factors are sensitive to nucleosome regulation, and does this sensitivity contribute to gene expression?

    **Methods:** We developed a computational method to evaluate the nucleosome sensitivity of transcription factors over a given stretch of the genome. We applied this method to the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor, a regulator of immune gene expression, and identified it as potentially sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the mouse Ly49 gene family.

    **Main Findings:** Using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene family is located, we found a specific depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1a binding sites in the expressed Ly49A gene compared to the silent Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosome-based regulation contributes to the expression of Ly49 genes.

    **Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the role of nucleosomes in gene regulation. We propose that this method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could aid in dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes in general. Furthermore, our results suggest that many different transcription factors may have the potential to be nucleosome-sensitive on a genome-wide scale.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of nucleosomes in regulating gene expression and highlights the potential of our computational method to predict nucleosome sensitivity. Future studies should investigate the nucleosome sensitivity of AML-1a binding sites at other non-Ly49 genes to determine whether this sensitivity is a selected trait for Ly49 regulation only or a more general property of AML-1a. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between nucleosomes, transcription factors, and gene expression, and have significant implications for understanding the regulation of immune gene expression.

    Title: Unraveling the Role of CDK7 in CDK4 and CDK6 Activation: A Chemical-Genetics Approach

    Background: Cell cycle progression, including genome duplication, is orchestrated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK activation depends on phosphorylation of their T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. However, the critical activation step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc25 phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation.

    Research Question: What is the role of CDK7 in the activation of CDK4 and CDK6, and are there other CDK-activating kinases involved?

    Methods: We employed a chemical-genetics approach using analogue-sensitive CDK7 (as/as) mutant HCT116 cells, in which CDK7 can be specifically inhibited by bulky adenine analogs.

    Main Findings: CDK7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations of CDK4/6, but for CDK4, this was at least partly dependent on its binding to p21cip1. In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21-binding to CDK4 increased concomitantly with disappearance of the most abundant phosphorylation of p21, which we localized at S130 and found to be catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The S130A mutation of p21 prevented the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impaired phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound CDK4.

    Implications: Our results reveal a crucial but partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6, the existence of CDK4-activating kinases other than CDK7, and novel CDK7-dependent positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the regulation of CDK4 and CDK6 activation and highlights the importance of CDK7 in cell cycle progression. The identification of CDK4-activating kinases other than CDK7 opens up new avenues for the development of targeted therapies for cancer treatment.

    **Title:** DUET/MMD1 Functions as a Transcriptional Regulator of Male Meiosis in Arabidopsis

    **Research Question:** What is the role of DUET/MMD1, a PHD finger protein, in regulating meiotic gene expression and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis in Arabidopsis?

    **Methods:** We used a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and microscopy techniques to investigate the function of DUET/MMD1 in Arabidopsis male meiosis. We performed in vitro binding assays to examine the interaction between DUET-PHD and H3K4me2, and analyzed the expression of DUET and its targets, TDM1 and JAS, during meiosis.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that DUET/MMD1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of male meiosis in Arabidopsis. We found that DUET-PHD binds H3K4me2 in vitro, and that this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. We also showed that DUET is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis II, independently of its function in meiosis I. Furthermore, we identified TDM1 and JAS as critical targets of DUET, with TDM1 being a direct target. Expression profiling revealed reduced expression of a subset of meiotic genes in the duet mutant.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that DUET/MMD1 plays a crucial role in regulating meiotic gene expression and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis in Arabidopsis. The stage-specific expression of DUET, confined to diplotene, implies that transcription of meiotic genes is under stagewise control in plants, similar to yeast. Our results also suggest that DUET might activate expression of male meiotic genes that contribute to sexual dimorphism, particularly in the regulation of meiotic cell cycle transitions and spindle organization.

    **Conclusions:** In summary, our study reveals the action of DUET/MMD1 as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis in Arabidopsis, and highlights the importance of H3K4me2 in Arabidopsis male reproduction. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic gene expression and cell cycle regulation in plants, and have implications for understanding the evolution of meiotic processes in multicellular eukaryotes.

    Title: Impaired Nuclear Export of Select mRNAs Contributes to Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) Pathogenesis

    Background: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by Fragile X premutation carriers. Previous studies have shown that Fragile X rCGG repeats are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and that the rCGG repeat-binding proteins Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 can modulate rCGG-mediated neuronal toxicity.

    Research Question: What is the role of Pur α in rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration, and how do Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis?

    Methods: We employed a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with Pur α and found that Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase, physically interacts with Pur α and modulates rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration. Biochemical analysis revealed that Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats decrease the expression of Rm62 posttranscriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses.

    Main Findings: Our results show that the expression of Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats significantly reduces the viability of otherwise viable heterozygous Rm62 mutant flies, providing further support for a strong genetic interaction between Rm62 and rCGG repeat-mediated neuronal cell death. We also observed an unexpected nuclear accumulation of specific mRNAs caused by Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats, indicating a potential deficit in the nuclear export of these mRNAs.

    Implications: Our findings suggest that the nuclear accumulation of select mRNAs caused by Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats may contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis. The mechanism could be via impaired nuclear export due to the decreased levels of Rm62 seen upon Fragile X premutation rCGG expression. This altered distribution of Hsp70 transcripts and their delay in turnover is similar to what was seen with Hsp70 transcripts in the Rm62/p68 mutation, indicating that Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats could produce deficits in the nuclear export of selective transcripts mediated by Rm62, such as Hsp70 mRNA.

    Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying FXTAS pathogenesis and highlights the potential role of Rm62 in modulating rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration. The findings suggest that impaired nuclear export of select mRNAs could be a key contributor to FXTAS pathogenesis, and further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway.

    **Title:** Direct Visualization of Psl Exopolysaccharide Matrix Formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms Reveals a Key Role in Biofilm Development and Dispersal

    **Research Question:** How does the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms form and contribute to biofilm development and dispersal?

    **Methods:** We employed direct visualization techniques to study the formation of the Psl exopolysaccharide matrix in P. aeruginosa biofilms at different stages of development, including attachment, maturation, and dispersal.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern during attachment, promoting cell-cell interactions and assembly of a matrix that holds bacteria in the biofilm and on the surface. During biofilm maturation, Psl accumulates on the periphery of 3-D-structured microcolonies, resulting in a Psl matrix-free cavity in the microcolony center. At the dispersal stage, swimming cells appear in this matrix cavity, and dead cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA) are concentrated in the Psl matrix-free area. Deletion of genes controlling cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the matrix cavity and microcolony dispersion.

    **Implications:** Our findings provide a mechanism for how P. aeruginosa builds a matrix and subsequently a cavity to free a portion of cells for seeding dispersal. The Psl matrix is a key scaffolding component of the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix, facilitating surface adherence and maintaining biofilm architecture during a biofilm developmental cycle.

    **Conclusions:** Our study reveals the importance of Psl exopolysaccharide in P. aeruginosa biofilm development and dispersal. The Psl matrix serves as a fibrous, matrix substance to enmesh bacteria in a biofilm, forming a bacterial "tissue." These findings open up avenues for therapeutics of biofilm-related complications and highlight the critical role of Psl in P. aeruginosa persistence.
Title: Elucidating the Molecular Heterogeneity of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Using Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX) and Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO): A Whole-Genome Comparison

    Abstract:
    Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignancy with a dismal prognosis, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) have emerged as promising tools for identifying new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. However, the molecular heterogeneity of these preclinical models and their concordance with matched human tumors remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumors and matched PDX, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumor, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumors for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Our findings indicate that PDX and PDO successfully recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations mainly in driver genes, but not across the greater expanse of annotated mutations. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. However, polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.

    Research Question:
    Can patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) accurately recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities?

    Methods:
    We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumors and matched PDX, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumor, PDX, and PDO.

    Implications:
    Our study highlights the potential of PDX and PDO as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC. However, our findings also suggest that these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.

    Conclusions:
    In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of PDAC PDX and PDO models and their concordance with matched human tumors. Our findings highlight the potential of PDX and PDO as tools for identifying new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC, but also underscore the need for further investigation into the molecular heterogeneity of these models.
Title: Identification of Novel Genetic Susceptibility Loci for Breast Cancer in East-Asian Women: A Genome-Wide Association Study

    Abstract:
    Background: Breast cancer is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While numerous genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for breast cancer, a significant proportion of the heritability remains unexplained. We aimed to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East-Asian women.

    Methods: We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. We analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, and evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls. The top 22 SNPs were further investigated in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls).

    Main Findings: We identified a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by SNP rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1. This locus showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85–0.94) and 0.80 (0.75–0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. We also identified two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, represented by SNPs rs9383951 and rs7107217, respectively.

    Implications: This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic architecture of breast cancer and may lead to the development of more effective screening and prevention strategies.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of breast cancer and underscores the need for further research to identify additional susceptibility loci. The discovery of novel genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk has the potential to improve our understanding of the disease and inform the development of personalized medicine approaches.

    **Title:** Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Positive South African Patients: Genetic Markers of Virulence and Patient Outcome

    **Research Question:** What are the genetic markers underlying Cryptococcus neoformans virulence and patient outcome in HIV-positive South African patients with cryptococcal meningitis?

    **Methods:** We conducted a cohort study of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) isolates from HIV-positive South African clinical trial patients with detailed clinical follow-up. We used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and in vitro phenotypic virulence assays to correlate genetic data with clinical and fungal markers of disease in the patient.

    **Main Findings:** Our study revealed high levels of genetic diversity and locus variability in South African Cn isolates compared to globally distributed types. We identified 50 sequence types grouped within the main molecular types VNI, VNII, and VNB, with 72% of isolates typed into one of seven 'high frequency' sequence types. Spatial analysis of patients' cryptococcal genotype did not show geographical clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent local acquisition. We found a significant relationship between genetic lineage and clinical outcome, with patients infected with the VNB lineage having worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003). This association was maintained even after adjustment for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimen.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, and that lineage plays an important role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. A detailed understanding of the genetic diversity in Southern Africa will support further investigation into how genetic diversity is structured across African environments, allowing assessment of the risks different ecotypes pose to infection.

    **Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the genetic markers of Cryptococcus neoformans virulence and patient outcome in HIV-positive South African patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Our results highlight the importance of considering genetic lineage in understanding the pathogenesis of cryptococcal meningitis and inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to combat this major cause of mortality in the developing world.
Title: Elucidating the Evolution of a Newly Evolved Signal Transduction Pathway in Candida albicans

    Abstract:
    The evolution of signal transduction pathways remains a poorly understood phenomenon, primarily due to the scarcity of examples of newly evolved pathways. In this study, we investigated the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen. Through the construction of an overexpression library for 107 transcription factors and mutational analyses, we identified Tec1 as the last component of this newly evolved pathway. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans, offering insights into the evolution of new signal transduction pathways.

    Methods:
    We constructed an overexpression library for 107 transcription factors in C. albicans and performed mutational analyses to identify the last component of the pheromone response pathway. Characterization of the TEC1 deletion mutant tec1/tec1 confirmed that it encoded the target transcription factor in the white cell pheromone response pathway.

    Main Findings:
    Our results show that the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans has been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans. The upstream portion of the pathway, including signals, receptors, the trimeric G protein complex, and the MAP kinase cascade, was derived from the upstream portion of the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process. Tec1, the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway, was derived from a filamentation pathway, and the white-specific downstream target genes were derived from an ancestral biofilm process.

    Implications:
    The evolution of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans provides a paradigm for how new signal transduction pathways may evolve. This study highlights the importance of identifying and interpreting the origins of components in young signal transduction pathways to gain insights into their evolution.

    Conclusions:
    The elucidation of the last component of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans provides a unique perspective on the evolution of new signal transduction pathways. Our findings suggest that the evolution of this pathway may be a paradigm for how some signal transduction pathways evolve, and may provide a framework for understanding the evolution of new pathways in other organisms.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Selection in Shaping Genomic GC-Content in Bacteria

    **Research Question:** Do differences in genomic GC-content among bacteria result from mutation bias, or is there evidence of selection acting to increase or decrease GC-content?

    **Methods:** We analyzed synonymous polymorphism datasets from 149 bacterial species across 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera to examine the patterns of GC→AT and AT→GC mutations at 4-fold degenerate sites.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show a significant excess of GC→AT mutations in GC-rich bacteria, whereas AT-rich bacteria exhibit an excess of AT→GC mutations. This pattern is observed across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species, suggesting that it is not restricted to specific groups of bacteria.

    **Implications:** The excess of GC→AT mutations in GC-rich bacteria cannot be explained by mutation bias, as it would imply a decline in GC-content, which is unsustainable. Additionally, the patterns are unlikely due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination.

    **Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that there is selection acting to increase synonymous GC-content in many bacterial species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, we conclude that there is also selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of bacterial genomes and highlight the importance of considering the role of selection in shaping genomic GC-content.

    **Significance:** This study provides new insights into the evolution of bacterial genomes and challenges the long-held assumption that genomic GC-content is solely the result of mutation bias. Our findings have important implications for the study of bacterial evolution, genome evolution, and the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections.
Title: Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Soil-Transmitted Helminths in Kenya: A Bayesian Space-Time Geostatistical Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are a major public health concern in many developing countries, including Kenya. Accurate and contemporary maps of STH prevalence are essential for guiding control efforts at policy-relevant spatial scales. Here, we present a new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of STHs in Kenya using a Bayesian space-time geostatistical model.

    Research Question: What is the spatial distribution of observed prevalence of STH infection in Kenya, and how has it changed over time?

    Methods: We assembled a dataset of 106,370 individuals from 945 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009. Ecological and climatic covariates were extracted from high-resolution satellite data and matched to survey locations. Bayesian space-time geostatistical models were developed for each STH species (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura) to interpolate the probability that infection prevalence exceeded the 20% threshold across the country for both 1989 and 2009.

    Main Findings: Our models estimated that in most areas of Kenya, the endemicity of STHs was below the 20% threshold in 2009, with areas of high prevalence located around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast. Comparison of the predicted distributions for 1989 and 2009 showed a gradual decrease in observed STH prevalence over time. The model estimated that approximately 2.8 million school-age children live in districts that warrant mass treatment.

    Implications: Our study demonstrates the utility of Bayesian space-time geostatistical models for estimating the combined observed prevalence of STHs and identifying areas of high risk. The resulting maps provide decision-makers with critical information for prioritizing districts for targeted STH control programs among school-aged children. As control efforts are successful in reducing infection levels, updated models can be used to refine decision-making in helminth control.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of accurate and contemporary maps of STH prevalence for guiding control efforts. The Bayesian space-time geostatistical approach presented here can be used to reliably estimate the combined observed prevalence of STHs and inform decision-making in helminth control programs.

    **Title:** CD1d-Restricted Invariant NKT Cells Mediate Innate Immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection

    **Research Question:** Do CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells contribute to cellular immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection?

    **Methods:** We established an in vitro system to study the role of iNKT cells in controlling Mtb replication. Splenocytes from uninfected mice were cultured with Mtb-infected macrophages, and the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was measured. We also adoptively transferred iNKT cells into mice infected with virulent Mtb by the aerosol route to determine their contribution to host defense.

    **Main Findings:** We found that iNKT cells, even in limiting quantities, are sufficient to restrict Mtb replication in vitro. The activation of iNKT cells requires CD1d expression by infected macrophages, as well as IL-12 and IL-18. In vivo, primary splenic iNKT cells obtained from uninfected mice significantly reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent Mtb. Our results show that iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect, even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosylceramide.

    **Implications:** Our study provides the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. The findings suggest that iNKT cells play a crucial role in innate immunity against Mtb infection, and that their activation is dependent on CD1d expression by infected macrophages and the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of iNKT cells in controlling Mtb replication and provides new insights into the mechanisms of innate immunity against Mtb infection. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against tuberculosis, a major global health problem.

    **Title:** Substrate-dependent localization of Tgl, a transglutaminase involved in Bacillus subtilis endospore coat assembly

    **Research Question:** How is the activity of Tgl, a transglutaminase responsible for cross-linking proteins in the Bacillus subtilis endospore coat, controlled during spore coat assembly?

    **Methods:** We investigated the localization and activity of Tgl in Bacillus subtilis endospores using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, including in vitro cross-linking assays and structural analysis by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that Tgl is produced in an active form and efficiently catalyzes amine incorporation and protein cross-linking in vitro. However, unlike other transglutaminases, Tgl's activity is not regulated by additional factors. Instead, we found that substrates assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production govern the localization of Tgl to the surface of the developing spore. We identified the glutamyl (Q) and lysil (K) substrate docking sites and showed that residues on the Q side of Tgl are more important for the assembly of Tgl than those on the K side.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that the substrate-dependent localization of Tgl is the primary mechanism to ensure proper temporal and spatial control of spore coat protein cross-linking, as well as specificity and the extent of its action. This mechanism may also control the activity of Tgl orthologues in other spore-forming bacteria.

    **Conclusions:** We propose that the dependency of Tgl on its substrates is used to accurately control the time, location, and extent of the enzyme's activity, directed at the covalent fortification of pre-assembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of protein cross-linking in Bacillus subtilis endospores and highlight the importance of substrate-dependent localization in controlling the activity of transglutaminases.
Title: Spatial Distribution and Risk Factors of Opisthorchis viverrini Infection in Champasack Province, Lao PDR: A Geostatistical Modeling Approach

    Abstract:

    Background: Opisthorchis viverrini is a food-borne trematode species that causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma, with an estimated 2.5 million individuals infected in Lao PDR. However, epidemiological studies are scarce, and the spatial distribution of infection remains poorly understood.

    Research Question: This study aimed to map the distribution of O. viverrini in southern Lao PDR, identify underlying risk factors, and predict the prevalence of O. viverrini at non-surveyed locations.

    Methods: A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in Champasack province in 2007. Data on demography, socioeconomic status, water supply, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data and fed into a geographical information system. Bayesian geostatistical models were employed to identify risk factors and investigate the spatial pattern of O. viverrini infection. Bayesian kriging was used to predict infection risk at non-surveyed locations.

    Main Findings: The prevalence of O. viverrini among 3,371 study participants with complete data records was 61.1%. Geostatistical models identified age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation (rice farmer, fisherman, and animal breeder), and unsafe drinking water source as risk factors for infection. History of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were found to be protective factors. Spatial patterns of O. viverrini were mainly governed by environmental factors, with predictive modeling identifying two different risk profiles: low risk in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor.

    Implications: This study provides the first risk map of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province, which is essential for spatial targeting of control efforts. Infection with O. viverrini appears to be strongly associated with exposure to the second intermediate host fish, human behavior, and culture, whereas high transmission is sustained by the lack of sanitation.

    Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the distribution of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province and emphasizes the use of environmental factors to predict O. viverrini prevalence. The results highlight the importance of addressing the lack of sanitation and promoting safe drinking water practices to control the transmission of O. viverrini infection.

    **Title:** Investigating the Role of Drains as Mosquito Larval Habitats in Dar es Salaam: Implications for Lymphatic Filariasis and Malaria Control

    **Research Question:** What is the importance of drains as larval habitats for Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes in Dar es Salaam, and how do these habitats impact the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria?

    **Methods:** We analyzed data on mosquito larval habitats collected by the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special drain survey conducted in 2006. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae in drains, and spatial variation in larval habitats was assessed using the local Moran's I indicator of spatial association.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that more than 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam are human-made, with drains being the most common type of aquatic habitat (42%). Drains with stagnant water had significantly higher odds of containing Anopheles and Culex larvae compared to drains with flowing water. Vegetation was positively associated with the presence of mosquito larvae. Spatial analysis revealed a positive correlation between the proportion of habitats with mosquito larvae.

    **Implications:** Our findings suggest that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate more than 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats currently treated with larvicides by the UMCP. The importance of human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors underscores the need for a synergy between ongoing control efforts for these diseases.

    **Conclusions:** Our study highlights the critical role of drains as larval habitats for Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes in Dar es Salaam. The results provide evidence that drains are the most common aquatic habitat and the most common habitat containing Anopheles and Culex larvae in the city. Our findings have significant implications for the control of lymphatic filariasis and malaria in Dar es Salaam, and suggest that a coordinated effort of vector control could foster a synergy between current programs to control these diseases.

    **Title:** Dengue Virus Infection Modulates Host Lipid Metabolism to Facilitate Replicative Complex Formation

    **Research Question:** How does dengue virus (DENV) infection modulate host lipid metabolism to facilitate replicative complex formation?

    **Methods:** We employed enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western blotting (WB) to investigate the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in DENV-infected cells. We also examined the co-localization of HMGCR and cholesterol with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E.

    **Main Findings:** We found that DENV infection significantly increased HMGCR activity, which was associated with the inactivation of AMPK. AMPK activation by metformin reduced HMGCR activity, suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates the enhanced activity of HMGCR. We also observed a reduction in AMPK phosphorylation activity in DENV-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi). HMGCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating a role for HMGCR and AMPK activity in replicative complex formation. Metformin and lovastatin (HMGCR inhibitor) altered this co-localization and replicative complex formation, supporting that active HMGCR is required for replicative complex formation.

    **Implications:** Our results suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complex formation. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during the DENV replicative cycle and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.

    **Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that DENV infection modulates host lipid metabolism to facilitate replicative complex formation by increasing HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation. These findings have important implications for the development of new antiviral strategies targeting HMGCR and AMPK activity to inhibit DENV replication.

    Title: Deciphering the Energy Landscape of tRNA Translocation in the Ribosome: A Quantitative Bridge between Kinetics and Thermodynamics

    Research Question: Can we establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape of tRNA translocation in the ribosome, enabling the estimation of free-energy barriers associated with this process?

    Methods: We employed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome (2.1 million atoms; 1.3 microseconds) to investigate the dynamics of tRNA translocation. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates were used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape.

    Main Findings: Our analysis revealed that many residues undergo coordinated displacements, reminiscent of rigid body movement, which can be decomposed into slow, large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations. We identified collective reaction coordinates that capture 30S-body rotation, 30S-head swivel, and tRNA displacements, which are essential motions during substrate translocation. These findings suggest that the ribosome functions as a "thermal ratchet machine," where random energetic fluctuations lead to large-scale diffusive configurational rearrangements.

    Implications: Our study provides a quantitative framework for understanding and interpreting the kinetics and thermodynamics of tRNA translocation in the ribosome. By establishing a bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape, we can estimate the free-energy barriers associated with this process. This framework is general and can be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states.

    Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the diffusion provides a unifying foundation for understanding and interpreting all available data for a given biological process. By probing the diffusive characteristics of subunit rotations and tRNA displacements, essential sub-processes that facilitate protein elongation in the cell, we have made the first steps towards establishing a quantitative framework for tRNA translocation in the ribosome.
Title: Elucidating the Genetic Landscape of Medullary Thyroid Cancer: Identification of Oncogenic Mutations and ALK Fusions

    Abstract:
    Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare malignancy characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations. To explore the genetic profiles of MTC, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 84 sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. Our results revealed 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes, with the most common mutation occurring in the RET proto-oncogene (47 cases). We also identified ALK fusions in two cases, including GFPT1-ALK and EML4-ALK, which were confirmed by PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. Our findings suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target for ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a candidate for molecular target therapy. This study provides new insights into the genetic landscape of MTC and highlights the potential for personalized cancer therapy.

    Title: Asymptomatic Leishmaniasis: A Hidden Threat to Visceral Leishmaniasis Elimination in Asia

    Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant public health concern in Asia, with three countries initiating a joint elimination program. However, the role of asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission, prognosis, and transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) remains poorly understood.

    Methods: An active mass survey was conducted in eight tribal villages to detect antileishmanial antibodies using rK39-based rapid diagnostic kits. A total of 2603 individuals were screened, and 185 were found positive, of which 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 had no such history. The asymptomatic cases were followed up for three years to observe sero-conversion and disease transformation.

    Main Findings: Out of 79 asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up, and 8 (10.39%) progressed to symptomatic VL, while 62 (80.52%) showed sero-conversion. Seven individuals (9.09%) remained seropositive after three years. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1.

    Implications: The findings suggest that asymptomatic leishmaniasis is a significant challenge to VL elimination efforts. Asymptomatic individuals can remain seropositive for up to three years, and disease progression can occur at any time during this period. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic cases does not guarantee that an area is free from leishmaniasis, as symptomatic VL or PKDL can appear even after three years.

    Conclusions: Asymptomatic leishmaniasis is a hidden threat to VL elimination efforts in Asia. The high sero-conversion rate among asymptomatic cases highlights the need for targeted interventions to detect and treat these individuals. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of considering asymptomatic cases in VL elimination programs and the need for long-term follow-up to monitor disease progression. Ultimately, addressing asymptomatic leishmaniasis is crucial to achieving the goal of VL elimination in Asia.

    **Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Genome Instability Induced by Ty912 Retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

    **Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) and aneuploidy induced by the Ty912 retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

    **Methods:** We employed Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze a large number of GCRs induced by Ty912 in a wild-type strain of S. cerevisiae. We also used MLPA probes to identify duplicated and deleted chromosome arms, and developed a "telomeric" probe set to analyze copy number changes at genomic loci located at the ends of each chromosome arm.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty912 is nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations are mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes, despite the presence of 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S. cerevisiae genome. We found that the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations result from RAD52-dependent recombination, but also observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements. Furthermore, we discovered that defects in ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) result in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, leading to aneuploidy that tends to occur simultaneously with GCRs.

    **Implications:** Our study demonstrates that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy. Our findings suggest that Ty912 preferentially recombines with regions of high sequence homology, and that physical proximity does not play a large role in the selection of the most commonly used translocation targets.

    **Conclusions:** In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of GCRs and aneuploidy induced by Ty912 retrotransposon in S. cerevisiae. Our results highlight the importance of RAD52-dependent recombination and the role of ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 in the regulation of GCRs and aneuploidy.

    **Title:** Semi-Definite Programming-Based Underestimation (SDU) for Protein-Protein Docking: A Novel Strategy for Efficient Free Energy Landscape Exploration

    **Research Question:** Can a semi-definite programming-based underestimation (SDU) method be adapted to efficiently explore the free energy landscape of protein-protein docking in the space of rigid body motions (SE(3)) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains?

    **Methods:** We developed a novel SDU algorithm that employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling. To overcome the challenges of applying SDU in SE(3), we introduced a strategy that separates independent variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance of the two proteins, and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules.

    **Main Findings:** Our results show that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and exhibits similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions.

    **Implications:** The successful application of SDU to protein-protein docking further validates the assumption that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native state. Our results demonstrate the potential of SDU to efficiently explore the free energy landscape of protein-protein interactions, which is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of protein function and regulation.

    **Conclusions:** The SDU strategy provides a novel and efficient approach to protein-protein docking, enabling the exploration of the free energy landscape in the space of rigid body motions (SE(3)) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains. Our results highlight the potential of SDU to accelerate the discovery of protein-protein interactions and shed light on the mechanisms of macromolecular association.
