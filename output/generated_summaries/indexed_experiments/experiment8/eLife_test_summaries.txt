This study investigated the structure and function of electrical synapses in zebraf, a type of fish, using expansion microscopy. Electrical synapses are a type of synapse that allows for direct cell-to-cell communication through electrical signals, as opposed to chemical synapses which use neurotransmitters. The study found that most of the contact area of a single electrical synapse, called a club ending (CE), operates as an electrical synapse, with only a small portion dedicated to chemical transmission. Expansion microscopy allowed for a detailed visualization of the distribution of synaptic components, including gap junctions (GJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). GJs are channels that allow electrical signals to pass between cells, while AJs are involved in cell-cell adhesion. The study found that AJs surround GJs throughout the contact, consistent with the organization of chemical and immunological synapses, which have adhesion molecules in the periphery and communicating molecules in the center. The study proposes that AJs could be components of electrical synapses, contributing to their structure and function. Multiple GJs were found at each CE, suggesting they operate as a functional unit, like chemical synapses with different numbers of release sites. The study suggests interactions between AJs and GJs could underlie the function of multiple GJs, regulating the conductance of the electrical synapse. The study also found that N-cadher, a molecule involved in chemical synapses, is distributed throughout the entire contact, indicating a primary role in electrical syn. Future investigations will shed light on the organization of electrical synapses. The study used 5-day-old zebraf larvae, bred and dissected the brain, fixed, and incubated with antibodies to label G, A, and other synaptic components. Expansion was performed using anchoring solution, monomer/gelling, and digestion. Confocal images were acquired and analyzed using FI. Colocalization analysis was performed to determine the proportion of fluorescence in one channel that colocalized with another. The study estimated lateral and axial resolutions of the microscope to be between 63.81-82 nm and 110-142.83 nm, respectively, after expansion. Quantitative analysis of fluorescence was carried out using raw data.
This study aimed to investigate the role of the pre-Bötzinger (preöt) complex, a primary generator of inspiratory breathing rhythm, in coordinating with orofacial and physiological activities. Researchers used a combination of optogenetic and transgenic approaches to selectively inhibit preöt neurons projecting to the facial nucleus (7) in rats. They found that photoin of these neurons reduced inspiratory activity of the mystacial pad muscle, with minimal effects on breathing and other autonomic activities. Selective photoin of preöt neurons projecting to 7 resulted in a smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location. The study also observed collateral projections of preöt neurons to multiple brainstem nuclei, including the ventral respiratory group (VR) and lateral medulla (LM). The results suggest that preöt may play a role in synchronization of respiratory, cardiovascular, oracial, and other physiological functions.

Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and serve as a general alarm to the brain. CGRP neurons modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. Most research has focused on their role in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP in active behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CGRP encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during chasing elevated responses in conditioning and retention, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more imminent. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand understanding of CGRP in the PBN as a critical system, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying threat and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger. Effective survival necessitates a repertoire of defensive behaviors, encompassing both passive and active responses. Passive strategies, such as freezing, help detection from predators by reducing motion, while active behaviors, including fleeing or fighting, enable swift escape or confrontation. The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active in response to varying threats is essential for survival. A component of this response is the alarm, which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting behaviors in the face of threats. These signals help quickly recognize and respond to potential threats. The mechanisms underlying alarm can be studied through Pavlovian fear conditioning. In this process, a neutral stimulus (CS) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to a conditioned response (CR) that can be expressed as freezing or fleeing. Neurons in the P that express CGRP have been suggested to function as general signals in the brain. These respond to noxious stimuli of diverse modalities and transmit intero and exteroceptive information to the forebrain. Additionally, CGRP relay US to the amygdala during conventional fear with footshock. Prior have primarily focused on the role of CG in mediating freezing, demonstrating activation exclusively elicits immediate behavior and contributes to formation memories. However, for CG to serve as a general system, they must transmit threat-related signals and facilitate coordination of behaviors, whether passive or active. The role of CG in passive is well-established, their involvement in active remains unexplored. To address, we employed a more ecologically relevant US using a predator robot to chase animals, incorporating imminent threat. We hypothesized CG modulate defensive depending on severity or type of threat. We recorded CG activity in response to aversive, including robot to determine if they encode noxious differentially. Then, manipulated CG activity, both activating and inactivating, during fear with robot and footock. Our results suggest manipulation bidirectionally modulates conditioned behaviors through perception of threat. These highlight CG as a general signal, facilitating passive behaviors while engaging active in response high-threat conditions.
This study investigated the relationship between obesity and brain structure using diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼ 30,000 participants in the UK Biob cohort. The researchers found that obesity, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), was associated with changes in two distinct brain systems: a prefrontal-temporal-stri system related to water content (isotropic fraction, ISO) and medial-occital-stri system related to neurite density (intra-cellular fraction, IC). The prefrontal-temp-stri system was co-located with genes involved in immune and metabolic processes, while the medial-occ-st system was co-located with G-protein coupled receptors and fatty acid binding. The study also found that obesity-related changes in ISO and IC were coupled but anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurobiologically differentiated. The researchers tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in ISO or IC was correlated with obesity using genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) and found a modest positive correlation between IC and WH, but no correlation between ISO and WH. The study also compared the effects of WH, BMI, and CR, a measure of systemic inflammation, on brain structure and found that WH and CR maps were different and that CR-WH correlation was stronger for ISO maps than IC maps. The study suggests that obesity-related changes in brain structure may be driven by different mechanisms, with changes in water content potentially an effect of obesity on the brain and changes in neurite an effect of the brain on obesity.
Researchers investigated the role of epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) using immunofluorescence staining and machine learning. They identified epithelial marker EpCAM, mesymal marker Viment, and plasticity marker CD24 in disseminating cells in the stroma of metastatic tumours, but not in non-mastatic tumours. EpCAMV+imCD+ cells were enriched in the stroma of metastatic tumours, while Ep+imCD- cells were not. The combination of EpCAM, Viment, and CD staining was used to predict metastasis with high accuracy, with an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) achieving 91% and 87% accuracy, respectively. The ANN was trained on 350 imaging from 24 tumours and validated on an independent cohort of 50 tum, predicting metastatic status with 54/59 slides. The study showed that EpCAMV+imCD+ cells in the stroma are likely tum cells, not stromal constituents. EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker, not expressed in stromal or immune cells. The study demonstrated the utility of immunofluores staining in machine learning for predicting metastasis, with potential to improve clinical management of OSC.
Apoptosis and efferocyt are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair, but the mechanisms of recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells are not fully understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to map cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. Apoptotic pathways and eocytosis receptors were elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Ly1+ macrophages during inflammation. Human diabetic wounds upregulated mRN for eocytosis genes and displayed altered eocyt signaling via Axl and its ligand GAS. Early in mouse wounds, upregulation of Axl in dendritic and fibrobl via TLR-independent mechanisms was observed. Inhibition of Axl in vivo revealed Axl is required for wound repair but dispensable for eocyt. In contrast, inhibition of another eoc receptor, Timd, in mouse wounds decreased eoc and abated repair. Data highlight distinct mechanisms of apopt cell detection and tissue repair and potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. Tissue homeostasis requires efficient and effective repair of injury, which involves dynamic changes in cellular heterogeneity and communication to heal, usually resulting in scar rather than true regeneration. Cell death is a common during tissue injury, and studies have shown the importance of apoptosis in initiation of inflammation to drive reparative processes. Proper and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for repair and progression to proliferation, when fibbl, blood, and tissue cells proliferate and form new tissue to repair. Several factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds, but mechanisms of apopt cell recognition and regulation are not well understood. The skin is an excellent model to define mechanisms of apopt cell regulation. After injury, mammalian skin undergoes stages of repair beginning with inflammation, which removes debris and pathogens. Inflammation regresses to proliferative, leading to coordination of epidermal kerocytes, fibbl, endothelial, and immune to reepidermal barrier and generate reparative new production and revascular. Apoptosis occurs after injury, phagocyt of apoptotic cells or eocyt by macroages reduces inflammatory and repair in several tissues. However, it is unclear how apoptosis controls wound healing. Apopt cell is characterized by cytomological, DNA fragmentation, activation of casases, and membrane alterations, including outer exposure of phosphatidser (PSer), which allows recognition by cellular receptors on phagocytes. The well-stud receptors allow phag to bind and phoc apoptotic include TAM (Tyro, Axl, and Mert) tyrosine kinases and TIM (cell immunoglobulin and mucin) family. TIM can directly bind PS, TAM require ligands growth-ar-specific 6 (GAS) and S1 to bind PS. To understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis regulates skin healing, sc-seq was performed on cells from murine wounds 24 and 48 hr after injury. Transcriptional alterations in apopt pathways occur in interval in fibbl, monocytes/macages, neutils, and dendritic cells. Inhibition of eoc receptors, Axl and Tim4, abated proper repair. Results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during early stages wound and the essential role of recognition and clearance of apoptotic in tissue after injury.
Researchers have developed a genetic barcoding strategy called Targeted Genetically Encoded Multiplexing (Ta-EM) that enables the labeling of specific cell populations in Drosophila for subsequent identification in single-cell sequencing. Ta-EM involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, allowing for the barcode to be read during droplet single-cell sequencing. The method was tested in various contexts, including photaxis, age fecundity, and gut motility assays, demonstrating its ability to measure behavior or phenotypes in multiplexed populations. The Ta- barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of bar fly lines using next-generation sequencing, with high accuracy and reproducibility, particularly when multiple barcodes are used to label an experimental condition and averaged. The Ta- measurements recapitulated laborious one-at-a-time measurements in photaxis, age fecundity, and gut motility assays, and can be used to streamline labor-intensive assays and quantify phenotypes with small effect sizes. Additionally, Ta- barcodes can be expressed by tissue Gal drivers and used to tag specific populations for single-cell sequencing, allowing positive identification of clusters in cell projects and multiplexing single-cell experiments. A limitation of Ta- is that barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell expression, likely due to strength of the Gal driver. However, variable recovery of Ta- barcodes were driven by the same-mut driver was observed. The Ta- barcodes can be used to multip behavioral or phenotyp measurements, providing a flexible system for barcoding organisms.
The article discusses the evolution of chemical defenses in poison frogs, specifically the Dendrobatidae family, and their ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet. Previous studies have focused on the diet-toxicity hypothesis, which suggests that diet specialization on ants and mites leads to the evolution of chemical defense. However, the authors propose a new four-phase model, the passive-accumulation hypothesis, which includes exposure to toxins, evolution of resistance, passive accumulation, and sequestration. They surveyed 104 species of Neotropical frogs, including 28 dendrobat species, 2 bufids, 1 leptactid, and 1 eleutheractid, and detected alkaloids in 13 of the 14 undefended dendid species, with lower diversity and quantity compared to defended lineages. GC-MS revealed higher diversity of alkaloids in defended dendid species than previously reported, and expanded knowledge of major classes within genera. UPL-HI-MS/MS detected alkaloids in two non-dendid species, including epibidine. The authors suggest passive accumulation is an ancestral state in Dendidae, possibly in related taxa, and selection on elimination resistance results in accumulation and defense. Future studies on toxicokinetics of alkaloids in tissues will shed light on putative evolutionary steps. Insights from frog physiology will provide perspective for human therapeutics modulating pharmacetic processes.
Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) is a complex process contributing to chemotherapy resistance in advanced cancer, particularly in breast cancer. The complexity of EMT and its reversal process, mesym-to-epithelial (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments. This study utilized a Tri-PMT lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze EMT in tumor cells. Findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis (Ri) during EMT and MET phases, with subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ER and mTOR signaling. Inhibiting Ri genetically or pharmacologically impaired EMT capability of tumor cells. Combining Ri inhibition with chemotherapy synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesymal cells. The study suggests targeting Ri pathway presents a promising strategy for treating advanced breast cancer.

Tumor cells exploit the EMT program to acquire aggressive properties, including anchorage-independent survival, invasion, and stemness. Multiple factors (TGF, E, Wnts, etc.), pathways (Smad/3, PIK/A, ER1/2, etc.), EMT transcription factors (Sn, Twist, Z1/2, etc.), and hundreds of E-related genes are involved in EMT. Complexity leads to a spectrum of E phenotypes existing at different tumor stages. EMT-end features contribute to heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapy resistance, making E an attractive target. Current E-targeting strategies focus on E stimuli, signaling, or mesym features, but may paradoxically promote MET, also contributing to malignancy. This study proposes instead targeting biological mediating transitions of E and MET to overcome limitations.

An EMT-tracing model, Tri-PMT, was used to investigate EMT in metastatic progression. The model traces E via RFP-GFP switch induced by mesym-specific expression. Absence of E reporting in metastatic lesions sparked debate about E status in tumor and biological significance. The group posited F1-C mediated E tracing might not capture majority E events compared to E-cad-C model. Disagreeing with assessment, the F1-C model's fidelity in tracing E, acknowledge limitations relying on single E marker. Using refined EMacer models, Li et al. discovered N-cells rather than Vim cells were enriched in lungases. This underscores complex nature of E process; metastasis does not require traditional mesym markers. Tri-P model, despite limitations, provides opportunities to study E's role in progression and chemores.

Single-cell RNA analysis revealed differential contributions of E tumor cells in progression. Post-EM GFP, mesym cells demonstrated chemores features compared to epithelial cells. Inspiring further study chemores using Tri-P model. In vitro, RFP TriMT actively transitioned to GFP in growth medium containing 10% FBS, indicating ongoing E process. A subpopulation, RFP+/GFP+, constituting 2-5% of cells, represented transitioning epith to mesym state. Immunobting confirmed association with hybrid E status. Doub cells expressed intermediate epithelial and mesym markers. Characterization revealed higher S and G/M phases in Doub cells compared to RFP and GFP. Bulk RNA analysis identified four clusters: Up, Trans, Down, Epithelial, and Mesym markers. Up genes attracted attention, including KEG Ribosome pathway. Gene set-represent assay showed enrichment in Up list. These results indicate Doub cells represent E-transitioning phase, as evidenced by established E markers and biological processes.

Trajectory analysis with E-related genes identified five states: Epith, Trans, Trans, and Mes. Cells classified based on position in E spectrum. Differential expression confirmed Trans gained mesym markers, such as Cdh, Vim, Fn, Z2, while retaining epith markers like K7. GSEA with biology process BP gene sets identified 49 overlapped pathways, including ribosome and RNA processing
Pearl millet, a drought-tolerant cereal, was domesticated in the Sahel region of West Africa 450 years ago. Its seeds are small, with limited reserves for seedling growth, and invest in a unique primary root to colonize deeper soil layers. A panel of pearl millet inbred lines from West and Central Africa was used to study root traits. Nine lines contrasting for root length were selected for field trials. Experiments were performed at the CNRA station in Senegal during the dry season 2018 and 202 to control irrigation. Fields were composed of sandy soil with low clay and silt and organic matter. Experiments were set using a randomized block design with 4 plots per variety, composed of 6 rows of 6.3 long with 0.9 between plants and 0.9 between rows. Irrigation was provided after sowing 30 of water to allow seeds to germinate, followed by a period of 42 of water withholding to impose seedling stress. Thinning was performed 15 after sowing to conserve a plant per planting. Fertil (N) was applied the entire trial after sowing and before. Fields were free of weeds. Plant was measured at 42 after sowing. Stay trait was expressed as percentage green compared to total leaves estimated on 3 per plot at 42 after sowing. Survival was measured as percentage surviving at 42 after sowing each compared initial plants emerged. Photos parameters were measured on 3 per plot 32 after s in 201 and 202 using a chlorophyll fluorometer. Long weather data in CN (Bey, Senegal) were analyzed to evaluate rainfall affects growth. A version of the Simple Model was used to simulate growth a West pearl genotype and dynamic water in soil. The model was run in water-limited mode with 3 plants density and no fertilizer.

This study investigated the neural representation of concrete and abstract concepts in the brain during naturalistic processing. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of 86 participants while they watched 10 full-length movies. They found that concrete and abstract words activated different brain regions, with concrete words associated with sensory and motor processing, and abstract with internal/interceptive/affective and linguistic processing. The study also found that brain regions involved in sensory and motor processing were involved in both types of words, and that language processing regions were involved in both concrete and abstract concepts. The results suggest that conceptual representations are not stable and may vary as a function of context. The study found that activation underlying concrete and abstract processing changes as a function of visual context, with concrete becoming more abstract in displaced contexts and abstract more concrete in situated. The neural mechanism behind this modulation is the default mode network (DM) and prefrontal regions associated with semantic control. The DM is involved in displaced conditions for both concrete and abstract processing, and is most activated in displaced involving abstract concepts. The study highlights the role of visual context in modulating the representation of abstract and concrete words, and suggests that similar effects may be observed in other sensory contexts. The relationship between concepts and language is open, but determinants of meaning are necessary for language. The study emphasizes the merits of investigating processing in naturalistic multimodal contexts, paving the way for future analyses of different types of contexts and how they affect processing in the brain. 

The study used the Natural Neuroimaging Database, which includes 86 participants who underwent fMRI while watching movies. The data was preprocessed using AFNI, and despiking, slice correction, coregistration, blurring, and alignment to the MNI template. The time series underwent smoothing and detrending through regressors for motion, white, matter, cerebrospinal, and run. Adjustments were made for breaks in viewing and artifacts by independent component analysis. Words in the movies were annotated using automated speech-to-text transcription from Amazon Services. Concrete and abstract words were selected from Winer et al, 201 norms, and matched for frequency and length. The final set of concrete words had a mean concre rating of 3.22, compared to 1.83 for abstract. The mean frequency and length for concrete was 3.69 and 4.91, compared 3.46 5.27 for abstract. Surpral of concrete was 22.19, and 21.86 for abstract. Semantic of concrete was 1.92, and 1.96 abstract. Luminance for concrete was 0.72, compared 0.65 abstract. Loudness for concrete was 0.69, compared 0.77. The study looked at collinear in the 2 context preceding word, surpral, motion, color, saturation, and spatial. The features were extracted using scikit package. The analysis tested prediction that contextual is away, neurobi organization will reflect systems in experient and linguistic processing. The study tested whether activation across, concrete and abstract are processed separable brain encoding types experient information, and if profiles change depending on objects in context. The deolution was done in two stages, first across, then within. The four sets of concrete and abstract were broken into regressors, situated, displaced, situated, abstract, and displaced. The contrasts were abstract vs displaced, concrete vs displaced, abstract vs situated, and displaced vs concrete. The mean con rating for concrete was 3.39, 3.35, 1.84,1. The frequency and length for concrete was 4.91 4.88,5.11 5.08. Surpral for situated was 21.98, 22.02, 22.10, 22.25. Semantic was 1.88,2.03,1.95.95
Researchers developed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecule inhibitors of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, a process that eliminates RNA transcripts from genes with truncating mutations. The screen used isogenic cell lines with frameshift mutations targeted by NMD, allowing for a signal-to-noise ratio. Four of eight hits increased mutant transcripts in a dose-dependent manner when re-tested. The most potent inhibitor, LY341, was suspected to target SM1, a kinase that regulates UP1, an enzyme with RNA helic and ATPase activity. However, off-target pan-kinase toxicity at required doses for N inhibition prevented LY341 from being used in vivo. SM1-11, a previously identified SM1 inhibitor, was insoluble and unsuitable for in vivo administration. A new SM1 inhibitor, K000, was developed with improved biophysical properties, increasing mutant transcripts and proteins from genes with trunc mutations, and neoantig presentation on cell surfaces. A bispecific antibody, K-B043, recognizing peptide-HLA and CD3, was developed to target T-cells to cancer cells with trunc mutations. In syngenic models, K000 slowed tumor growth in immunocompet mice, but not immunocom mice. The study suggests K000 may be used to prevent onset of symptoms in pediatric syndes caused by germl trunc mutations or reduce cancer incidence in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.
A study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biob, a large population-based cohort, investigated the association between phenotypic age (Pheno) and cancer risk. Pheno was calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and phenotypic acceleration (PhenoAcc) was calculated by subtracting the effect of chronological age. Participants were divided into biologically younger (204,890) and older (169,573), with median PhenoAcc of -2.61 and 3.28, respectively. Incident cancer cases (22,370) occurred during a median follow-up of 7.09 years. PhenoAcc was associated with increased risk of lip-oral-pharynx, esagus, stomach, colon-rect, pancre, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpuseri, prostate, kidney, multiple myoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymph leukemia, and negatively associated with prostate cancer. Overall, PhenoAcc was associated with increased risk in men (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17) and women (1.15, 95 CI 1.13-1.17) per 5 years. A significant increase in cancer risk was observed from decile 1 to decile 10 of PhenoAcc. Compared to biologically younger, older participants had higher overall risk, HR 1.22 (95 CI 1.18-1.27) in men, 1.26 (95 CI 1.22-1.31) in women. Pheno was consistently associated with increased risk within genetic groups, with high genetic and older Pheno having greatest risk. Incident rates per 100,000 person-years estimated 147.89 (95 CI 141.87-154.92) men, 107.17 (95 101.14-113.19) women, versus 581.06 (537.12.625) men, 594.71 (558.50.630.92) women with low genetic younger Pheno. Approximate risks 2.29 (95 CI 2.10-2.51) men, 1.94 ( CI 1.78-2.11) women were observed in high genetic older Pheno compared to low younger Pheno. No interaction between genetic and Pheno on cancer risk was observed. Pheno was associated with higher risk across genetic groups, with standardized 5 incident rates 5.78% and 4.58 bi younger men women versus 6.90 and 5.17 older men and 2.71 and 2.83 bi younger women versus 3.87 and 3.39 older.
A mobile app called Biome was launched in Japan in 2019 to collect data on the distribution of plants and animals using mobile devices. The app allows users to post photographs of plants and animals, and automatically records location and timestamp from EX data. If EX data is unavailable, users can manually input locality and timestamp. To support species identification, the app provides two options: a list of candidate species based on image and metadata, and users can seek help from other users. The app conceals geol of endangered species listed on Japanese or prefectural red lists. Users earn points through contributions, including submissions and suggestions, and progress to higher levels based on total. Points depend on rarity, conservation, status, and societal of species. The app has accumulated 839,844 downloads by September 2023. The raw data through Biome contains invalid records, defined as unclear images, non-wild, misidentifications, and images with privacy issues. To improve quality, excluded records deemed invalid based on metadata and users' reactions. Filtered Bi data used in investigations. Occurrence of non-w individuals eliminated as possible using users' information and location. Bi users report inappropriate records, and excluded all reported. Private records excluded due to inappropriate and misidentification not screened by users. Excluded records have been by certified users or not received suggestions. Certified users defined as achieved accuracy, submitted inappropriate, and created public records. Specialist users, a subset certified, identified taxa, made records and suggestions accuracy. The proportion of Bi data suitable for SDs assessed. SDs influenced by invalid records, quality based on 142 records from rare and common species of plants, mollcs, insects, fishes, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Rare species defined as less or equal 10 in Bi data, common as highest in each taxonomic. Each plant and insect selected 145 records, other taxonomic 70. Records screened targeted organisms, contained individuals. Accuracy species reidentified by experts with taxonomic. Compared identifications by experts and Bi, classified into categories: correct, misidentification. Accuracy SD affected by amount and quality, blending Bi in may increase data and/or introduce different information. Two datasets, Traditional and Bi + Traditional, trained. Varying data by downsampling, from 20 to 20,000, to evaluate impact. For Bi + Traditional, proportion kept 50. Conducted three iterations to reduce stochastic. Obtained BI each, evaluated effects type and amount, accounting species. Calculated mean across iterations. Applied Fisher-trans to approximate normal. Fitted general mixed model, accommodated species effect. Implemented R packages l4 and lTest.
This study investigates the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (BMPR1) in lung development, specifically in the mesenchymal cells, and its contribution to congenital pulmonary cyst formation. The researchers used a mouse model with a mesenchyme-specific deletion of Bmpra, which resulted in abnormal lung morphogenesis and cyst formation at late gestation. Congenital pulmonary cysts are reported in human patients with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) as a result of abnormal lung development. Reduction of airway smooth muscle cells (SMC) and decreased elastin fibers were found in cystic airways of human CP samples. The study suggests that mesenchymal B1 is essential for lung development, particularly air branching morphogenesis. Disruption of B1-mediated mesym signaling causes prenatalway malformation and cyst lesions. Multiple mechanisms, including deficiency of air SMC, air elastin defect, and perturbation of Sox-Sox epithelial progenitor axis, contribute to congenital cyst pathogenesis. Downstream Sm-independent p38 pathway is critical in mediating BMP-regulated air S development. The study helps understand normal development and mechanisms of air malformation and congenital diseases.
The study investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P) in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that EG and PI(4,5)P form nanodomains that partially colocalize before stimulation, and the degree of coaggregation decreases after stimulation. Single-molecule imaging confirmed these results, detecting transient colocalization of EG and PI(4,5)P. Expression of a PI(4,5)P phosphatase reduced dimerization and autophosphorylation of EG after stimulation. These findings are consistent with previous in vitro and in silico observations that PI(4,5)P interacts with arginine residues in the JM region of EG, stabilizing active conformation EG. Biochemical analyses suggest local PI(4,5)P around EG before stimulation acts as substrate for EG effectors, including PI3 and PLC, after stimulation, and plays role in dimerization and activation EG. PI(4,5)P is also involved in pathway EG deactivation after stimulation, tyrosine-phosphorylated EG recruits PLC, degrading PI(4,5)P producing DAG, activating protein C, phosphorylating Thr of EG, deactivating EG. The study used HeLa cells, CHO-K cells, and cell lines stably expressing EG-K, EG-K, EG-K, EG-K, EG-K, EG-K EG-K, EG-K EG-K, EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG EG-K EG-K EG-K EG-K EG EG-K EG-K EG-K EG EG-K EG-K EG-K EG
This study reports the discovery and characterization of a mitochondrial carrier unique to strameniles that transports glycol intermediates, providing a missing link between the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. The branched glycol pathway is found in striles, a diverse group of eukotic organisms including protists, algae, multicellular algae, and pathogenic fungi such as Phytophthora, which causes potato blight, and the human protozoan Blastocyst. Blastyst relies solely on glycol for energy and lacks a cyolic branch of glycol. Phylogenetic analysis identified a new class of carylate carriers in striles closely related to plant dicarate carriers, which transport tricarboxylates for dicarboxylates. The study focused on Blastyst as a model strile organism and characterized human and Blastycar carriers, demonstrating a unique substrate specificity distinct from human carriers. The Blastyc carrier has the same specificity as human OGC and is unable to transport glycol intermediates, suggesting it is not the missing step in branched glycol pathway. Blastyc-1 did not transport any tested substrates but is expressed and localized to mitochondria, indicating it is not a pseudogene. Blast-2 transports inorganic and glycol intermediates, including dihydroacet phosphate and glyceral-3-phosphate, but not canonical substrates of Blastyc, such as malate, male, malate, and succinate. Mitochondrial carriers operate as antiporters, with chemical gradient of substrate driving uptake of counter-substrate. Blastyc-2 seems to compensate for loss of some mitochondrial carriers, including transport of inorganic in absence of DIC homologue. The distantly related citrate carrier, which transports dicboxyl, trarboxyl, and P, was lost in Blastyc, possibly due to incomplete trarboxylic acid cycle. Blastyc can synthesize P from pyruate oxaloate and show P transport by Blast-2. P can be exported by Blast-2 and converted to pyruate and lact by cyolic pyruate and lact dehydrogen, leading to synthesis ATP and conversion NAD to N+ in cyol. This may play significant role in cyolic generation, as no AD/AT carrier in Blast. Blast contains gly-3-phosphatehydrogen, oxidizing NAD to gly-3-phosphate diacet, which can be transported by Blast-2 to generate ATP and reducing equivalents. In other eukotes, cyolic NAD oxidized by mal-aspart shuttle, but requires orthologue mitochondrial aspart/glut carrier, not found in Blast. Selective advantage of pay phase glycol in mitochondria is adaptation to anoxic environment, with limited ability to detox oxygen. In natural environment, Blast uses protons as terminal acceptors by pyruateferredox oxidoreduct, producing hydrogen and ferment products. Under aerobic stress, uses oxygen as terminal acceptor by alternative oxidase producing water. As adaptation to anoxic, Blast lost some oxidative components, including III and IV, ATP synth, and AD/ carriers. Consequently, lost ability to synthesize ATP via this route. Role taken over by transfer pay phase glycol to mitochondria, advantages degradation glucose in cyol requires ATP and pyrophosphate, generates four ATP in mitochond, used for ATP-requiring processes, protein, DNA replication, transcription, and synthesis. Two N+ reduced to N, used by I to generate proton force drive import proteins and molecules into mitochond. Cytolic can supplied by export P by Blast-2 or mitochondrial carrier equilating adenine nucleotide pools.
The study proposes a new framework for genetic association studies, called Haplotype Score (HFS), which uses a deep learning model, Se, to calculate functional genomic scores for haplotypes and replaces genotypes in traditional association studies. The FS framework was applied to 14 traits in the UK Biobank dataset, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10^(-8) and 269 causal loci with a median of 63 causal per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with strong biological interpretability, including 'circadian-chronotype' and 'aridonic-intelligence'. The study also applied least shrinkage and selection operator (LASS) regression to integrate FS scores with SNP-based polygenic scores, showing an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ance poly prediction. The authors conclude that FS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.

The study highlights the limitations of current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in elucidating downstream mechanisms and applications, including the reliance on population frequency of variants and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among neighboring variants, which can lead to false positives. The FS framework addresses these issues by aggregating the impact of variants on transcription or functional genomics, providing direct interpretations, bypassing LD and population history, and combining common and rare variants. The study uses Poly Transcriptome Risk (PTR) scores as a successful implementation of this strategy, employing genetically determined levels rather than genotypes to predict complex traits, but notes its accuracy is limited due to transcription level imputation from genotypes.

The authors propose FS as a step forward, utilizing functional genomics in this strategy, leveraging the outputs of a state-of-the-art DL model, Se, which accepts DNA and computes multiple class scores representing facets of genomic activities. FS integrates all variants, even rare as singletons, into a continuous variable, unaffected by LD. The study applies FS to the UKob dataset, segmenting the genome into 409 bp loci, computing FS for each haplotype, and analyzing associations with traits. The results confirm FS offers improvement in biological and poly prediction of complex traits compared to SNP-based methods, demonstrating its value in genetic studies.

The study fine-mapped causal loci with FS, identifying 269 with a median of 63 per trait, compared to SNP-based analysis, and found 727 pathway and 153 tissue associations with biological interpretability. The authors also integrated FS with SNP polygenic scores using LASS regression, showing improvement in crossance prediction. They conclude FS is a promising strategy for understanding complex traits. The study highlights FS limitations, including computational cost and integration with other genomic features, and suggests extending FS to predict post-translational modifications and chromosomal structures.

This study investigated the effects of different types of mental training on stress-related changes in the hippocampus. A total of 332 healthy adults (197 women, mean age 40.7 ± 9.2 years, 20-55) participated in the ReSource study. Participants were randomly assigned to three 9-month training cohorts experiencing modules in different orders, one 3-month Affect cohort and retest cohort. The 3-month Presence module targeted attention and intero awareness, while the 3 Affect module cultivated social emotions such as compassion and prosocial motivation. The 3 Perspective module trained metaognition and perspective on self and others. The study found that only the 3 Affect module related an increase in hippocamp CA-3 subfield volume with alterations in functional and reduction in diurnal cortisol. Across analyses observed alterations between cortisol and CA-3 volume function, pinpointing this region as a target for further investigation on stress and the brain. Multivariate analyses also pointed to a circuit understanding of latent diurnal scores. Results may inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce stress and update models on the role of hippocamp formations for socio-emotional and stress processes.

This study investigates the genetic basis of local adaptation in three sunflower species: Helianthus annus, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar. The authors use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in these species, which harbor large numbers of species-specific inversions. They find evidence of genome-wide repeatability signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, particularly within regions harbouring inversions in one species. This suggests that inversions may facilitate local adaptation, but some loci can still contribute to adaptation without the recombination-suppressing effect. The authors identify regions of the genome that exhibit similarity of association among pairs of lineages, driven by repeated use of the same genes but not alleles. They explore the number of regions that could contribute to adaptation for each variable, related to genic redundancy. Results show that adaptation in sunflowers is flexible, with different species using different sets of loci to adapt to the same environment, but with some redundancy. The study highlights the importance of inversions in adaptation, with regions harbouring inversions contributing to adaptation in species lacking inversions. Theoretical models of evolution should be re-evaluated in light of empirical data on redundancy. The study suggests that adaptation is complex, not mapping onto assumptions of population genetic or quantitative models. The authors propose a two-class representation of genetic basis of variation, classifying loci into core and peripheral sets based on redundancy. The study provides insights into the genic redundancy underlying adaptation, with temperature being the strongest driver of repeatability at phenotyp and genomic levels. The authors use BayPass to correct for population structure in genotype-environment tests, identifying outlier SNPs with BF ≥ 10. They also use Spearman's correlation to identify outlier SNPs with environment. GWAS is performed on developmental and morphological traits, with population structure controlled by principal components and IBS kinship. Candidate genes are selected within 100 kb of the SNP with lowest p-value. The study identifies top windows with outlier SN per 5 kb, comparing to the 0.999 quantile of binomial expectation. Windows are binned by recombination rate, with expected frequency of SN per window calculated separately. The authors use the null test to identify windows repeated association, comparing to 10,000 background SN. They cluster neighbouring windows with similar signatures into CRAs. The study estimates shared variation based on counts of shared and non-SNPs. The overlap between CRs and haplocks is assessed by contingency table and randomization. The authors use Pic to identify windows with strong association in multiple species. The C-score is used to estimate the number of loci contributing to variation, under the assumption all have equal chance. The study provides insights into the genic redundancy underlying adaptation, with temperature being the strongest driver of repeility at phen and genomic levels. The study highlights the importance of inversions in adaptation, with regions harbouring inv contributing to adaptation in species lacking inv. Theoretical models of evolution should be re-evaluated in light of data on redundancy. The study suggests adaptation is complex, not mapping onto assumptions of population or quantitative models. The authors propose a two-class representation of genetic of variation, classifying loci into core and peripheral based on redundancy.

The study investigated the effects of aging on the mammary epithelium, a bilayer of two phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial (LEPs) and myoepithelial (MEPs). The researchers used primary cells from human mammary epithelial (HME) cultures, derived from reduction mammoplast tissue, to analyze gene expression in 54 LE and MEP samples from 19 women across a range of ages. They found that LEs exhibited stereotypical changes with age, including upregulation and downregulation of gene expression, while MEPs showed less age-dependent changes. The study identified 4,040 genes with lineage-specific DE in younger LEs and 334 in older LEs, with 59% of which were LE-specific and 41% MEP-specific. Loss of lineage fidelity, defined as the loss of faithful expression of lineage markers with age, occurred genome-wide and was detected in 102 genes, majority of which were LE-specific. The researchers proposed two models to explain the loss of lineage: directional changes through stereic upregulation or downregulation of gene expression and increased variance in expression of lineage genes. They found that age-dependent changes in LEs contributed to the loss of lineage, but did not fully account for it. Gene set analysis identified 137 genes with age-dependent variance in LE and 128 in MEP, including regulatory TFs EHF, KDMB, H4, MY, GL1, and DRT1 in LE and H6 in MEP. The study validated the findings in three scRNA-seq datasets from non-tumenic breast tissue, BRCA+/ breast tissue, and healthy mammoplast tissue. The results showed that LEs integrated age signals from MEP and exhibited stereotypical changes, while MEP showed less age-dependent changes. Age-dependent and variant changes in LEs shaped tissue-level predictive biomarkers that classified normal and cancer subtypes. The study demonstrated increased molecular noise during aging led to variances in transcriptomes between individuals and proposed this mechanism underlies differences in susceptibility to breast cancers, particularly luminal sub.
This study explores the use of non-target reads from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data to estimate pest and microbiome loads in a natural plant population of Thlaspi arse, a biofuel crop. The authors collected 207 accessions from 36 European populations, grew them in a glasshouse, and noticed aphid and mildew infestations after 46 days. They extracted DNA, prepared libraries, and sequenced paired-end for 150 cycles using Illumina NovaSeq 600 and HiSeq Ten. Raw reads were demultiplexed, quality-trimmed, and deduplicated. Reads were classified based on mapping behavior: target (T. arse), ambiguous (T. arse and pest), and exogenous (not T. arse). Exogenous reads were classified using MG-RA, a web tool for phylogen analysis of metomes, and nine taxonomic groups were selected for follow-up analysis: Aphidae, Culidae, Perosporales, Stylocaceae, Burkholderaceae, Myacteraceae, and Pseudomonaceae. Custom scripts were used to extract counts of genus Bucha and Erysales. Reads were also mapped to M. persa and B. aphic genomes to test high-quality assembly sensitivity. To quantify non-T. ar loads, reads were corrected for total deduplicated reads. To exclude contamination, aph and mildew presence/absence data were collected in the field, and no difference was found between samples with and without aph or mild on original plant. To test variation, a general model was used with population as predictor, and SNP heritability was measured using marker_h function from herit package. MG-RA assigned aph to A. pis, but not fitting with visual observations, so three aph species were tested: A. pis, B. brass, and M. pers. Reads were mapped to pseudo-reference and counted. A follow-up experiment estimated glucin contents of 207 lines in absence pathogens. Bioclimatic variables were extracted for 25 years predating experiment from Copernicus website. Mixed models were run with bioclim variables or glucin as explanatory and exogenous counts dependent, correcting population structure with IBS. GWA was conducted with mixed models correcting population with IBS as random factor. Enrichment analysis was performed for prior candidate genes. Epiiverse toolkit was used for methylation analysis, and DMR were called with minimum coverage 4. Methylation-phenotype relationships were investigated using EWA, excluding samples with bisulf non-conversion >1. DMR were intersected with genomic features, and densities were calculated. EWA was run for positions within DMR, and Bonerr thresholds were calculated. Enrichment was performed for genomic features.
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of combining two dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors, DSM265 and TDC-334, in preventing the emergence of resistance in Plasium falciparum in vitro. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the dhod locus can confer resistance to various DHH inhibitors, but the combination of DSM and TDC-334 failed to prevent the emergence of cross-resistant parasites. The study identified three mutations that confer resistance to TDC-334, but the majority of dh mutations tested were sensitive to this compound. Copy number variation (CN) was a common mechanism of resistance to T-334 across independent selections. Three of four populations of wild 3.7.10 selected with T-334 exhibited increased copy of dhod. The study also found that sequentially treating a collaterally sensitive DH-276 line with T-334 led to the acquisition of additional genetic changes rather than reversion to wild. The result has implications for strategies such as drug cycling or simultaneous use of multiple treatments that aim to delay the emergence of resistance. The study compared the phenotype of DH-276/227 double with DH-276 and DH227 lines and found additive epist, resulting in high-level resistance to DSM. The major takeaway is that combination with DSM and T-334 failed to suppress resistance and hypothesized due to the diversity of evolutionarily competitive dh mutations that confer to various inhibitors. The study highlights the flexibility of the DH enzyme, which has 13 individual mutations and 2 sets of mutations that confer resistance DH. The study identified two additional point mutations, DH263 and DH532, as well as the DH276/227 double line. The DH263 mutation is not resistant to DSM, while DH263 at the same site confers strong resistance. The study used molecular simulation to provide insight into the mechanism of resistance and binding of TDC-334 to wild and 276 mutant proteins, consistent with increased sensitivity observed. The study also provided a framework for future in vivo work, demonstrating that in vitro data is a good predictor of in vivo evolution of resistance. The continued identification of novel mutations in dh locus suggests that still not saturated the dh resistome. The mutational flexibility of the binding site increases the likelihood of resistance to any compound or combination that targets this. CN is a general mechanism of resistance to multiple classes of DH inhibitors, bringing into question the usefulness of pursuing DH inhibitors.
The article presents a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant strains as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The model shows a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while decreasing in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study underscores the critical role of malaria diversity in bioge patterns of resistance. Prolong usage of antimicrobial drugs always results in emergence and spread of resistant strains. The history of Plasium falcum malaria over a century witnessed succession of spread of resistance to five classes of drugs by region. However, patterns of drug evolution, such as speed of establishment and frequencies, differ drastically across bioge regions. De novo-resistant alleles are constantly generated, but widespread strains can be traced to unstable regions, especially Southeast Asia and South America. Frequencies of resistant genotypes sweep to fixation in these regions under drug usage. In contrast, frequencies are variable in endemic regions like sub-Saharan Africa. Interestingly, high-trans regions decrease resistant genotypes when drug usage is reduced, while low-trans regions maintain high frequencies even after drug abandonment. Various models have been developed to explain some, but not all, of empirical resistance patterns. Relationships between transmission and frequencies of resistance were discovered, each with some empirical support: transmission does not influence fate of genotypes, resistance increases and decreases with transmission, and can be fixed at both high and low transmission. Other models predict it's harder for resistance to spread in high-trans regions, but patterns are not systematically inspected across parameters. Non-equilibrium scenarios, where insecticides or bednets reduced transmission, reductions in frequency were observed. Differences in model predictions can be attributed to three types of assumptions: how population immunity is considered, cost of resistance modeled, and multiplicity of infection (MO) included. Advances in agent-based models enabled inclusion of biological processes, but complexity limits direct application to investigation. A generalizable model is needed to capture most biological processes impacting survival and transmission of parasites. Most models explored factors such as drug usage, treatment rate, vector capacity, within-host competition, population immunity, and recombination, but not strain diversity. Orders of magnitude antigenic diversity of Plasium falcum among bioge zones drive differences in epidemiological features. Hyper-diverse antigens in sub-Saharan emerged from coevolution arms among hosts, vectors, and parasites. Asymptomatic carriers serve reservoir strain diversity despite prevalence decreasing with age. Age-prevalence pattern attributed acquired immunity repeated infections, represented as generalized classes in disease models. Molecular epidemiology indicates importance of strain-specific immunity. Asexual stage, intraerythrocytic parasites express adhes proteins to avoid clearance spleen during circulation. One major protein, P. falcum erythrocyte membrane 1 (PfEMP), encoded by var gene family of 60 copies. Immune maintains composition between strains minimal. High regions many antigenically distinct strains coexist. Hosts seen specific variants determine clearance rate. Therefore, variation in host immunity, acquired from exposure local diversity, plays key role in local dynamics and fate of resistance.
This study investigated the impact of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, on early embryonic development. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast-like cells (ELCs) were exposed to Δ-TH at concentrations of 0-100µM for 48 hours. The results showed that Δ-TH increased the proliferation of naive ESCs but not ELCs. Δ-TH exposure also increased glycolytic rates in both ESCs and ELCs, but this did not lead to increased energy production in mitochondria. Instead, it led to the accumulation of metabolic intermediates used in anabolic reactions for synthesis of amino acids, nucleides, and lipids. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that Δ-TH-induced metabolic reprogramming in ESCs was transcriptionally encoded, with increased expression of genes in anabolic pathways. In contrast, annotations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ELC did not show transcriptional control of anabolism. The study also assessed the impact of Δ-TH on the differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from ESC and ELC. Results showed that Δ-TH increased PG induction, particularly at 100µM. Metabolic characterization of PGCs from Δ- exposed ESC and ELC showed increased respiration. Δ-TH exposure remodeled ESC and ELC metabolome, and this memory was retained in PGCs. Transcriptome analysis of PGCs from Δ-exposed ESC and ELC showed downregulation of genes related to structural components, interaction with the extracellular, and cell adhesion. The study highlights the importance of Δ-TH-induced metabolic reprogramming and its role as a driver of exposure through developmental stages.
Researchers sequenced 93 zebraf (Danio rerio) from multiple wild and laboratory populations, identifying 151 NLR genes, more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of the NLRs were present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the fish. Wild fish had up to twice as many NLRs per individual and up to four times more NLR per population than laboratory strains. Nucleotide diversity in zraf NLR genes was low, with half the copies being monomorphic and the remaining having few polymorphisms, likely due to purifying selection. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against pathogens, and immune genes tend to evolve quickly with high variability. Many immune genes are lineage-specific to groups, while others have roles in various species. NLRs, containing a nucleotide-binding domain followed by repeats, have immune functions in animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. In animals, repeats are leucine-rich (LRR) and proteins are classified as NLRs (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich containing, also NOD receptors). They have multiple functions, acting as pathogen sensors or transcription factors, components or modulators of inflamomes. Plants have NLR structurally similar to animals and carry out central immune functions. N diversity has been characterized in several species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, with different reperto found in strains or individuals. NLR can be referred to as Nomes, and species-wide repertoire as pan-NLR. Most knowledge of Ns in animals comes from humans and rodents, but their reperto (20-30 genes) smaller than many species like sea urchin, sponge, and fish. Even in mice, N (Np1) has copy numbers in different laboratory strains, ranging 2-5. In fishes, studies reported reperto in range 10-50 genes, e.g. In zraf, hundreds of Ns are present, including the model species. The zraf reference contains nearly 400 N genes, two-thirds located on putative chromosome 4, in a region with extensive haplotyp variation. The majority of Ns represent a fish-specific subtype, N-C, although can be divided into at least six based on similarities and conserved exons. A structure of zraf N-C proteins is presented in Figure 1. All possess FNA domain, which precedes nucleotide domain and encoded by same exon near N-terminus. FNA is in some cases preceded effector PY, but encoded separate exon. Many N-C have B.2 domain at C-terminal, separated from FNA by multiple introns and exons containing LRs. B.2 functions protein-protein interaction and found variety genes like TR ubiquitin ligases involved immunity. It is unknown why fishes have many Ns, how they evolve, and within-species variability. Studies shown viral and bacterial infections induce specific Ns. Some have PY or CARD and form inflames similar mammalian Ns. A species inventory of major Ns in model zraf would provide insights evolution and diversity.
A new taxon of Famian ovule, Alenia tria gen. et sp. nov., is reported from the Upper Devonian Wut Formation in Jianchuan mine, Xinhang, Anhui, China. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integument wings extending outwards, folding inwards along the abaxial side, and enclosing most of the nucus. The ovule is borne terminally on dichotom branches and lacks a cupule. Alenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cup evolved in probable photosynthetic and wind dispersal functions. It indicates the seed originated earlier than wind dispersal mechanisms such as plume and papp, and three or four-wing seeds followed seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows three-wing seeds are adapted to dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four under the same conditions. Since plants colonized the land, wind dispersal anemory became common with the wing a key dispersal strategy through history (Taylor et al., 2009; Ma, 2009; McLough and Pott, 201). Wing seeds evolved numerous in many lineages of extinct and extant plants (spermatophytes) (Schenk,201; Stevenson et al,201). Lacking as integary outgrowths, the earliest ovules in Famian (372-359 million years ago, Lateian) rarely a role in dispers (Rowe,199). Nearly Famian ovules are cupulate, i.e., borne a protecting and pollinating cup (Prestanni et al,201; Meyererthaud et,201). Waria was a Famian ov with integary wings, but attachment cup unknown (Rowe,199). Guia was aian ov with wings and terminally aculate, devoid cup (Wang et,202). This documents a Famian seed with ov, Alenia tri gen. et. sp. nov. occurs in Jianch mine of China, where Xinhang forest discovered in situycid trees Guangend (Wang et,201). Terminally borne ovules are three-wing and aculate, implying novel functions of integ. Based current evidence and mathematical, the evolution of wing seeds and windal of seeds with number discussed.
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) (Klein et al., 1982;Deininger et al.,2000). This cytogenetic abnormality results in BCR-ABL fusion, which encodes the chimeric protein B-ABL with tyrosine activity (Cortes et al.,202). Based on its oncogenic role in Ph+ leukemia, B- has been regarded the pivotal for Ph leukemia therapy, especially chronic myel leukemia (CML). Tyine inhibitors (TIs) have been the treatment for Ph leukemia, remarkably prolonging patients' lifespan and improving quality of life (Hochhaus et al.,202;Jour andKantjian,202). However, most develop T resistance and relapse after long treatment (raun et al.,202). The increase of B- expression affects sensitivity to TIs and determines rate of T resistance in patients with Ph leukemia, in addition to mutations in kinase (Jour et al,200). Mutations in kinase change conformation B, interfering binding between TIs and B, resulting in decreased efficacy (uss et al2018). The increase of B also affects sensitivity to TIs and determines rate of disease and T resistance in patients with Ph leukemia (arnes et200). Therefore, effective degradation B could address T resistance and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), and protein degradation strategy may a new approach (ék et202). Currently, based ubiquin E3ases, including VHL, CRN, and, degradation atM have significant B in CML cell lines and patient-derived cells with multiple mutations (Dem et al2016; et al2016; Shimawa et2017 et al2019; Zhao et2019 Blem et2019 Liu et202). However, excellent activity has not translate to efficacy in vivo, even xenografted models (Zhao et201 Jiang et202), resulting uncertainty of these degraders. Nonetheless, unsatisfactory not surprising because underlying B expression largely unclear. Receptor-associated protein the synapse (RSYN) identified classic adaptor binds acetylcholine (A) and cytoskeleton proteins, contributing A clustering and neuromus junction (uh andFuhr200;Witz et201). YN found exert NED3 ligase activity catalyzing A aggregation ( et201). Despite studies RSY in muscular and neuronal and tissues (ay and Mei201; et2018), regarding involvement leukogenesis no information far except our finding. Previously, Y found in cytos Ph leukemia line K562 small used probe proteins (Wang et201). Because identified E ligase and occurrence Ph line, speculated Y contribute Ph development enzymatic instead scaffolding. Type postl modification (PT) nedlation catalyzed neuronal cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein (NED)-activating E (NAE), ED-conjugating E(U2/UB12 or UEF), and substrate-specific ED3 ligase complete coval conjugation ED to lysine substrate (van andPeg201;Enche201). nedlation proteins reversed by denylases such as ED1. In last decades, evidence strong involvement dysnedlation tumor, neurodegenerative, cardiac, immunoregulation, and others (Ying et201;Zhou et201;Li et202;Yao et202). Therefore, modulation nedlation feasible strategy. This study report RSY highly expressed Ph leukemia patients and promotes progression, presumably stabilizing B- via nedlation. nedlation B- competes ubiquination degradation increase B stability. Additionally, ED3 lig activity RSY increased SRC-mediated phosphorylation. Prior investigating roles RSY pathogenesis, mRNA and protein levels analyzed. mRNA RSN RNAq datasets
Phage-derived peptidlycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, have been investigated as alternatives to traditional antibiotics due to their unique mechanism of action, potent bactericidal activity, and low risk of resistance development. However, their effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria is hindered by the outer membrane, requiring additional strategies to overcome this barrier. Engineered lysins, such as Artilins, Innys, and Lysins, have shown promising performance, but clinically effective lysins against Gram-negative remain inadequately addressed. A new strategy to mine bactericidal peidlycan hyrolases from proteomes through lys-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming was reported, using the Ply307in-derived peptide as a template. Two peidly hyrolases, PH10 and PH11, were discovered from A. baumanni proteome with high bacteridal activity against various Gram-negative and Gram microbes. Unlike other Gram-negative lys, PH10 and PH11 exhibited intrinsic activity via different mechanisms, with C-terminal antimicrobial peptides P-CP and P-CP penetrating the outer membrane and cleaving peidcan bonds, leading to osm lysis. PH10 and PH11 belonged to the T lysoe family with conserved Glu-Asp-Th catalytic triad. PH10 and PH11 retained 100% bacteridal activity after heat treatment through a unique dimeromer transition. The thermost capacity distinguishes them from other enzymes, with potential applications in feed and medical devices requiring autoclaving. PH10 underwent a dimeronomer transition mediated by seven intermolecular interactions to survive heat. Bacterophages are abundant on earth, with 80% of genomes populated with at least one proph, serving as an untapped arsenal for ph-related antimicrobial agents. Advances in cultuics, 'booting ph genomes, and computational biology may discover inaccessible proph from genome data, increasing bacterial value as a source of therapeutically promising drugs. Findings implied big data, such as genomes, proteomes, humanomes, and metagen datasets, could fight antimicrobial resistance.
A study was conducted to investigate the symptoms of pancreatic cancer using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records (EHR). The study included 6.9 million patients from 1994-2018, with 23,592 diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and 18,523 confirmed by the Danish Cancer Registry. A subset of 307 patients had their EHRs extracted, with almost equal numbers of males and females identified with pancreatic cancer in both NPR and EHR. Text mining was used to extract symptoms from clinical notes five years prior to cancer diagnosis, compared to most frequent symptoms in NPR. The text approach identified 16 unique symptoms not in clinical, including intestinal disorders, dalgia, and emisms. Frequent exclusively in clinical were intestinal disorders, dalg, and em. NPR contained 24 ICD-10 symptoms not by text, including functional, dysag, abnormal findings, oema, and abnormal medical images. 57 symptoms occurred in both sources, with 15 frequent in text and NPR, including pain, nausea, vomiting, abnormal blood pressure, abdominal pain, and symptoms concerning food and fluid. The ICD-10 chapters were used to generate disease-wide trajectories, with 386 patients following at least one symptom, 21% of pancreatic cases. Significant trajectories were identified with codes from chapter symptoms, signs, abnormal and clinical laboratory findings, most after diagnosis, general, malaise, fatigue, and cachex, fewer prior jaundice, hemorrhage, and pain. 90 days distinguished early and late patients to investigate survival, only small fraction resect at diagnosis. Registry trajectories identified symptoms related pancreatic, abdominal pain, syncope faint and dizziness, jaundice, signs digestive and urinary prior diagnosis, less known symptoms hemorrh respiratory, hematuria, and pain throat. The study found disease associations in cardiovascular chapter, angina, acute myocardial infarction, chronic ischemic heart, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, and digestive chapter chlithias, disorders lipoprotein. Patients with cardiovascular prior pancreatic tend worse survival. Temporality of symptoms prior diagnosis found headache, enlarged lymph, abnormalities, heartbeat, pain, and peristis, abdominal pain. Trajectories generated for patients with notes five years prior diagnosis, 311 followed least, 10% cases. Most began pain, traversed jaice, disorders poryr and bilirubin, fever, intestinal. Groups starting cough jaice intestinal had median survival, pain jaice normal function had lower. Overall, progress pain, abnormalities, heartbeat, dizziness, polyuria into risk factors abdominal pain, anorexia, jaice. Survival of texted trajectories resembled registry.
This study investigated the development of sleep spindle and slow oscillation (SO) coupling in children and adolescents aged 5-6, 8-11, and 14-18 years, and adults 20-26 years. The researchers used individualized detection of single events to characterize age-specific patterns of slow and fast spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in these age groups. They found that the predominant type of fastind was development-specific, nested in a frequency below the canonical spindle range for the majority of children, while the slow oscillation-spindle pattern was evident for spind in the canonical fast range in all age, but less precise in children. Measures of fast maturity indicated the similarity between development-specific and adult-like fastind, and slow maturity reflected the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance. The study found that fast maturity was uniquely associated with slow-spindle strength and precision across age. The results suggest that the ability to generate adult-like canonical spind determines coupling and strength across childhood and adolescence. The maturation of thalamocortical circuits is implicated as the cornerstone of adult-like slowindle patterns. The study provides a starting point for research on the relation between age changes in brain structure and function, emergence of adult-like slowindle, and cognitive development.
Researchers analyzed 36,035 human genes from the NCBI Gene database and found that 18,295 were differentially expressed in at least one transcriptomics experiment, but only 161 (0.88%) were mentioned in the title or abstract of the reporting articles and 692 (3.78%) in citing articles. Similarly, 791 genes were hits in affinity-mass spectrometry, but 311 (3.93%) were in titles/abstract in reporting and 407 (5.14) in citing. In genome-wide association studies, 104 genes were hits, 413 (39.6%) in titles/abstract in reporting and 319 (30.6) in citing. A tool, Find Understudied Genes (FM), was developed to identify factors associated with gene selection in high-throughput experiments. FM identified 45 factors, 33 of which were significantly associated with selection in at least one assay. The most informative factor was the number of articles about a gene, followed by the availability of a plasmid and protein length. FM was used to identify understud genes associated with aging, one of which was splicing factor proline and glutamine (Sfp), found transcriptionally downregulated in murine and required for transcription elongation of long genes. The study has limitations, including annotation errors in databases, focus on human genes, and using title/abstract as proxy for attention. Researchers propose controlled trials where high-through studies report hits in abstracts even not investigated by authors.
Researchers have established a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis, resembling the hyperangi characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The model was induced by treating embryos with high glucose, resulting in excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells (ECs) revealed an increased ratio of tip and proliferating ECs, accompanied by altered expression of angiogenic genes. The transcription factor Foxo1 was identified as downregulated in high-treated embryos, responsible for excessive angiogenesis. Fox1 exerts its function by downregulating its target marck1, regardless of D-glucose or L-glucose treatment. Both caloric and nonoric monoschar treatment lead to excessive angi by promoting differentiation of quies EC into tip through fox1-marck1 pathway. Associations between artificially sweetened beverages (AS) and cardiovascular disease have been proposed, possibly due to factors like impact on central nervous system, hormone, gut secretion, and microbiota, appetite, and calorie intake. However, the mechanisms underlying have not been documented. This study provided evidence that administration of nonoric monacides leads to excessive angi, suggesting angi may not be attributed to caloric properties. Excessive angi is a major feature of DR and nephropathy, findings support a biological mechanism underlying positive between nonoric monacides and microvascular associated with type 2 diabetes, suggesting nonoricides not suitable for AS consumption. Notable abnormalities were observed in vessels treated dischar, including lactose, maltose, and sucrose, consistent with previous stating intakes not associated with risk type 2. The effects cannot be attributed to osmotic pressure, restricted reaction may maintain within safe range. A zraf model was established by treating embryos with high monacides, observing excessive induced by glucose and nonoricides, initiated by activating quies EC into proliferating tip. Effects mediated by fox-marck pathway. Results provided insights into roles nonoric in health and mechanisms.
This study investigated whether common structures shared across different domains would be employed to facilitate memory of multiple sequences and its neural correlates. Participants performed a multi-sequence working memory task, where three disks with different locations and colors were presented, and they had to recall the locations and colors in sequence. The consistency between location and color sequences was manipulated by aligning or misaligning the trajectories. Results showed that color-location alignment was associated with better memory performance than misalignment, and the benefit was attributed to structure-induced constraints on items decreasing representational uncertainty. EEG recordings provided evidence for a 'compressive strategy, i.e., reactivation of shared during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of sequences during recall. Structure reactivation was related to behavior and neural replay. Common structure was leveraged for storage of sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating information organization in working memory. The study demonstrates that subjects spontaneously realign trajectories across features to facilitate memory of sequences, suggesting an efficient way to link seemingly unrelated events. Trajectories for location and color are defined in a coordinate system, providing an abstract cognitive map for memory. The findings differ from Gestalt principles of perceptual organization and associative memory, and reflect a higher-order relationship between maps. The study also differs from recent works on structure and generalization, as it does not involve pre-exposure or task-related rewards. The results can be understood in terms of schematic, which plays roles in memory formation, and a congruent schema facilitates retrieval compared to incongruent. Cognitive refers to internal spatial representation, while schematic denotes a broader range of circumstances. The design manipulates consistency of spatial distance between color and sequences in a map, cognitive might be a conservative term for findings, reflecting schema-based reorganization. The study reveals the intelligence of brain to achieve efficient coding, exploiting statistical regularities without explicit instructions. The common structure is inspired by cognitive map theory, which argues reasoning abstract follows computational principles in spatial domains, supported by neuroscientific evidence common substrates for representation across domains. The study extends the role of cognitive in organizing across domains in working memory, revealing compress encoding and replay facilitating sequence. Replay refers sequential reactivation in the same or reversed as experience, observed in rodent hippocampus and higher non-spatial tasks in human brains, representing structure, inference, and generalization. The study demonstrates new roles of replay in structure, mediating alignment sequences in working memory. Structure and content are factorized, and structure guides replay new experiences. The ability to perceive relational is a major distinction between human and nonhumanates. The study provides behavioral and neural evidence that structure is dissociated from content, factor coding, and can be aligned, contributing to efficient representation memory.
Mutations in the human PUR gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder PUR syndrome, characterized by developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties. Unlike other monogenic disorders, almost all reported mutations in the nucleic-binding protein result in full penetrance. This study experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PUR and the impact of PUR syndrome-causing mutations on protein integrity. Patient-derived mutations impaired subcellular localization of hsURA to stress-gran and P-bodies, but not a hallmark of PUR syndrome. Knockdown of PUR reduced stress-gran size, indicating PUR's influence on gran. hsURA localizes to Podies, and knockdown leads to reduced P-body formation, suggesting a role in P-body localization for etiology. hsURA binds RNA and unwinds double-stranded nucleic, and binds single-strandedic acids. Patient variants showed reduced RNA binding and unwinding activity, with K97 variant showing almost complete loss of unwinding. Crystal structures of hsURA and hsURA were solved, revealing flexibility and promuity of domains. Mutations in surface-exposed residues, such as K97, can result in promuous folding and full disease. The study provides proof-of-principle for in vitro and structural studies to classify variants in hsURA as potentially pathogenic or benign. hsURA's flexibility and promuity make it susceptible to mutations, even moderate changes in local charge and stereochemistry. This may explain why many variations across sequence result in full disease. The R140 variant, initially reported to cause PUR syndrome, was found to be benign, and now listed as uncertain in NCBI ClinVar. In vitro studies may serve as diagnostic tool to distinguish pathogenic from benign variations.
This study investigated the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TR4) in eccrine sweat glands and its interaction with anoctamin 1 (ANO) in temperature-dependent perspiration. TR4 was expressed in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads and co-localized with cytokeratin 8 and aquaporin-5. TR4-expressing secretory cells were positive for calcitonin gene-related peptide and heterogeneously labeled. TR4 was absent in myoepithelial cells and co-localized with ANO and AQP at the apical site of secretory cells, suggesting a complex formation that promotes sweat secretion. TR4-expressing secret cells were involved in secretion of macromolecular components as well as water and ions. The interaction between TR4 and ANO caused Cl efflux and water eff in eccrine acinar cells, increasing exocrine function and depolarizing primary neurons. TR4-deficient mice showed reduced sweating at 35°C but not 25°C, and menthol inhibited sweating in both WT and TR8KO mice. An9 inhibited basal sweating at 25 and 35°C. TR4 expression was higher in normohrotic skin from patients with acquired generalized anhidrosis (AIG) than anhidrot skin from patients with AIG, suggesting TR4 plays a role in normal pers in humans. TR4-deficient mice climbed a slippery slope less than WT mice, indicating increased paw sweat for traction. The study suggests TR4 and ANO complex is involved in eccrine function, including perspiration, and could be a target for novel treatments for hyperhidrosis and hypohrosis.
The article presents a multi-scale description of primate cortices, showing that all cortices can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. The cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory that overlaps with 70 other mammalian species. The results indicate that all cerebral cortices approximate the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This understanding enables precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. The authors demonstrate the importance of this understanding by showing a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, observing a fourfold increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a scale of 2mm. The new understanding may generate biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. The universal law can be rewritten as 2A0=Ae1.25, where A0=T4 is a fundamental element that defines the threshold between gyral and lissal cortex. This highlights a new perspective on the law, suggesting a relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic measures of cortical size given the folded laminar structure of cortex. The scaling exponent is reminiscent of fractal scaling, where complex shapes reveal smaller levels of self-similar detail as probed in smaller scales or equivalently higher resolutions. The fractal dimension is 2.5, the factor being topological of areas. Fractal scaling has been postulated for various aspects of cortical morphology, with recent papers using MRI data. The authors propose a new method to construct morphologically realise cortices at any spatial or resolution through coarse-graining, removing morph details smaller than specified while preserving surface integrity. They use a box-counting algorithm to measure fract dimension, but expand it to analyse cortices as realisations of the cortex at specified scale. The method requires bounding and white surfaces of cortical as input, obtained from MRI reconstructions in 11 primate species.
This study investigated the dynamics of the NF-κ transcription factor REL in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, a type of pancreatic cancer. The researchers used CRIS-C9 gene editing to tag REL endogenously with GFP in human PDAC cell lines M Pa2 and P1, allowing for live imaging and analysis of REL responses to the cytokine TNα, which is upregulated in PDAC progression. The study found that PDAC cells exhibit atypical REL dynamics compared to other cell types, with sustained nuclear localisation and cycle-independent responses. M Pa2 cells showed higher and sustained REL localisation compared to P1 cells, while P1 had a damped response over time. REL translocation occurred immediately after TNα addition and peak localisation around 1 post-Tα. The study used Bayesian modelling to determine descriptors of cell shape and cytoskeleton correlating with heterogeneity in REL localisation, finding differences in cytoplasm act intensity and act localisation predictive of differences in REL between PD cells. The study also used RNA-seq with Pa and P cells treated with TNα and Iκ-S, identifying 254 genes regulated by TNα, potential candidates for NF-κ signalling output in PD. The study found that ARAP31 is a transcription target of TNα and REL, previously associated with cancer, involved in act modulation. The study also identified a feedback between REL translocation and NU2 expression, similar to prior findings that NU2 increases activity through act polymerisation and myos activity. The study provides an incentive for exploration of the REL-NU2 axis in PD progression and response to therapy.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are common in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in PTEN, the main regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using Caenorhabdis elegans neuromuscular system, both excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABA inputs regulate muscle activity, we found d-18/PT mutations impact GABAergic but not cholinergic neurodevelopment. This selective result in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The observed GABA defects in d-18/PT mutants are due to reduced DAF-16/FOX activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have proven effective for disorders associated E imbalances. We found a diet with ketone β-hydrobutyrate early induces DAF-16/FOX, improving GABA neurodevelopment in d-PT mutants. Our study provides insights into the link between PT mutations and neurodevelopment defects and delves the mechanisms the underlying potential effects of KDs. Maintaining a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission is critical for optimal brain function. Disruptions in this balance are observed in neurodevelopment disorders. Deficits in inhibitory GABA signaling are reported in autism disorders and related pathologies. PT is a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the conserved phosphatidyositol 3-phosphate (PIK)/protein B (Akt) pathway. Reports using animal models highlighted the importance PT in neurodevelopment. Mutations PT were found in patients with autism. The molecular underlying neurodevelopmental deficits in PT mutants poorly understood. Caenorhabdis elegans neuus system, where excitatory cholin and inhibitory neurons regulate muscle, provides a platform for studying function, balance, and coordination between excitatory inhibitory signals. This system yielded insights fundamental transmission mechanisms. Over the last decade, studies on this system significantly contributed understanding human neurodevelopment disorders, epilepsy, and hemipleg migraine. The conservation of PIK pathway in C elegans enhances the applicability for investigating this pathway in neuro. We found mutations d-18, the PT ortholog in C elegans, impair GABA inhibitory signaling due decreased D-16/FOX activity during development. Ketogenic diets, which force fatty acids into ketones, have been used treating pathologies associated E imbalances, such as refractory epileies and autism. Recently, Ks demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating autistic symptoms in humans and rodent models. The mechanisms underlying these effects largely unknown. We found a diet with ketone β-hydrobutrate early development D-16/FOX, mitigating GABA defects in d-PT mutants. This study provides a system for studying the role conserved PIK/FOX pathway in neuro and contributes understanding the effects ketones in neuro.
This study investigated the role of innate immune factors in controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, specifically focusing on the cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) and its mechanism of action. Researchers found that IL-1 inhibited SARSV-2-induced cell fusion in various cell lines, including HEK293, Caco-2, and Calu-3, through the activation of the Rho/RO pathway, leading to the formation of actin bundles at cell junctions, preventing syncytia formation and viral transmission. The study also showed that IL-1 treatment reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia in human lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo in mice, suggesting a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, IL-1 was found to be essential for triggering vaccine-induced immunity and innate responses against SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the importance of innate immunity in antiviral defense. Furthermore, the study found that MyD or IRA4 deficiency abolished the inhibitory effect of IL-1 on SARSV-2-induced cell fusion, suggesting that these immune molecules are critical in containing SARS-2 infection, which may be a mechanism for disease susceptibility in patients with these deficiencies. The study also explored the role of IL-1 in controlling SARS-2 transmission in vivo, showing that IL-1 prevented transmission through the formation of act bundles via the R/RO pathway. Overall, the study demonstrated the function and mechanism of IL-1 in inhibiting SARS-2-induced syncia and highlighted the importance of innate factors in controlling coronaviruses, providing potential therapeutic targets for viral control.
This study investigated the role of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila melanogaster, which are analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, in regulating metabolic homeostasis and behavior. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that IPC activity decreased during starvation and rebounded after glucose feeding, consistent with previous studies showing DPs accumulation in IPCs under starvation. However, the rebound was slow, taking 6 hours to reach baseline levels, contrasting with behavioral state modulation occurring on a millisecond timescale. The study also found that IPC activity did not increase during glucose perfusion, suggesting that IPCs do not directly sense hemol sugar levels, unlike mammalian beta cells. Instead, IPCs responded to ingestion on a timescale of hours, suggesting gut-secreted neuropeptides mediate the incretin effect in Dophila. DH44 neurons, sensitive to extracellular glucose, were found to inhibit IPCs, while DHNs outside the PI drove locomotion and probis extension, a hallmark of feeding behavior. Optogenetic activation of DHNs increased locomotion and probis extension, while IPC activation reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity. The study highlights the intricate connections between neuroendocrine signaling, nutrient sensing, and behavior in Doph, with implications for understanding metabolic regulation and disease.
Endogenous tags have become valuable tools for studying protein behavior in live cells at endogenous levels. Self-complement split fluorescent proteins have been used for efficient endogenous, and this approach recently generated the first library of endogenous in HEK cells, with 131 proteins tagged in populations enriched by FACS. The library is a resource for the community, but researchers need single clones of tagged proteins to study. Knowledge from this library is restricted to one cell type. Given diversity in mechanisms controlling processes across cell types, need to generate endogenous in cells differentiating into types. This study generated a fully human iPS line expressing NG-10 for endogenous with NG in stem cells differentiating into any type. The 2017 NG-P line is heterozygous for NG-10 expression integrated at the AAV1 safe harbor locus. Compared to lentiviral, this design minimizes NG-10 silencing and provides consistent NG-10 expression across cells, even time and differentiation. Multiple genes were tagged with NG, efficiencies ranging 0.69 to 37.5% measured by Nanop sequencing. Tagging with NG in iPSCs was lower than mouse embryos and HEK cells. Endogenous with NG was more efficient than full-length GFP in iPSCs. Endogenous by HDR is inefficient, and results consistent with iPSC being challenging to edit compared to other types. The splitNeGreen system enables endogenous on scale to hundreds proteins. Endogenous with full-length proteins requires assembling large templates, limiting proteins tagged once. Low endogenous levels limit detection by flow cytometry, requiring microscopy with sensitive cameras or detectors. Alternative methods like fixation and antibody staining can detect weakly expressed endogenous. Expression of 9 NG-tagged proteins in iPSC was consistent with RNA-seq data. Proteins showed unique localizations consistent with function, unlikely NG tag affected function. Nestin and -tubulin expressed low in undifferentiated iPSC, despite ectermal and neuronal markers. Detection range of endogenous requires brighter proteins or sensitive detectors. Edited cells had diverse genotypes by editing, including mutated NG tags and indels, warranting clonal isolation. Clonal is inefficient in iPSC, programmed dissociation-induced apoptosis upon loss attachment or cell contact. Optimized protocol for single-cell recovery iPSC after FACS, up 80% wells in 96-well showed growth after 10 days. Created a macro for image-based screening 96-well, used multiplex Nanop sequencing for high-throughput clones. Automated could increase clonal isolation, isolate lines transcriptionally silent genes tagged endogenous. Clones had consistent fluorescence, different levels across protein expression, NG-10/NG complement comparable full-length proteins. Goal endogenous iPSC is live studies diverse processes comparative human types. iPSC sensitive phototoxic, difficult image weak endogenous longer periods or intervals. Sensitivity not reported human mouse, likely imaging conditions vary setups. Timapse often uses overexpress trans or dyes, higher settings lower laser power exposure. Many have spinning confocal epifluorescence microscopes, image restoration provides high-quality iPSC without resolution. Used CARE, content-aware neural developed Weert, 2018, training matched images low and high-expos. This allowed imaging extended time high-resolution low-exposure.

Researchers have developed a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions through microelectrode arrays that is compatible with electrophysiological recording of neuronal activity pre- and postlesion. A custom current source was built to ensure stable current delivery throughout the lesion, repeated, and across different electrode and animal types. This represents a significant refinement of lesion studies in neuroscience. The method was tested ex vivo with porine and ovine brains and in vivo with porine brains. Altering the amount and duration of current changed the size of the lesion, as evidenced by histology. Selection of adjacent electrodes allowed for spatial localization under 16mm array. Preliminary tests were performed in sedatedhes macaque to verify safety, and 14 in awakehes macques. Readouts from lesion device and electrophys verify delivery and no damage to recording. This technique is expected to improve understanding of the system by combining termination with detailed electrophysiology. It shares elements with other techniques but is a common inactivation method. Electrolytic lesion through microelect array is a refinement in precision and unique compatibility with electrophiology.
Researchers investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestr) can detect and avoid neonicotinoids, a type of pesticide commonly used in agriculture, in nectar. They used a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological assays to test the mouthparts of the bumblebees. In the behavioral assay, bbees were given a choice between sucrose and sucrose solutions containing field-relevant concentrations of neonicinoids, and their feeding behavior was recorded. The results showed that bbees did not avoid solutions containing neonicoids, even at high concentrations. In electrophysiological assays, the researchers recorded from taste sensilla on the mouthparts of bbe and found that neonicoids did not elicit spikes or suppress sugarensing neurons. The study suggests that bumblees do not have mechanisms to detect and avoid neonicoids in nectar. The researchers also tested the effect of sulfox, another pesticide, and found that it did not elicit spikes or suppress sugarensing neurons. The study provides evidence that bumblees are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of Plasmod knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHP) across Southeast Asia. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites revealed heterogeneous prevalence across the region, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borne. The study found that regions with higher NHP prevalence overlap with human infection hotspots, and transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Using remote sensing data and statistical models, they identified relationships between P. know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity. These findings address critical gaps in regional P know epidemiology and indicate prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key driver of human spillo risk. Zoon diseases arise from spillo of pathogens into human populations, typically from reservoirs in wildlife. Anthropogenic land use and cover change have been linked to infectious outbreaks. Practices such as deforestation, logging, clearing for cash crops, or conversion of forest to arable land are accelerating in tropical Southeast Asia. Mechanisms underlying the association between habitat and spillo risk are complex and occur multiple scales. In Brazil, re-emergence of Yellow Fever in N and humans linked to highly fragmented areas. An increase in edge habitat in fragmented landscapes facilitate overlap and contact between wildlife, vectors, and humans. Ecological interfaces contribute to spillo in other vector-borne diseases, including Zika, Babes, Trypanosoma, and zotic malaria. Habitat fragmentation can impact wildlife viability, reduced species occupancy, and disease in disturbed habitats. Disangling this interplay is essential for ecological surveillance and mitigation in regions undergoing change. P know is a public health threat in Southeast, following identification of infection foci in Borne in 2004. It is a zoon, with satic cycle in NHP, human cases from spillo events. Transmission requires bites from infective mosquitos, primarily anopheline of Leosphus Complex. Natural hosts are Long-tailed macques and Pigailed macques, occurring across Southeast.

Researchers analyzed genetic data from hepatocellular tumors at high spatial resolution to study early tumor evolution in vivo. They found that tumors evolved under uniform growth, with no evidence of spatial constraints leading to radial growth. The rate of cell death was comparable to the rate of division, indicating the tumor grew slowly. High resolution allowed tracking changes in mutational processes over time, revealing a difference between early and late mutations. The dominant mutational signature in early mutations was associated with exogenous mutagen aristocholic acid, found in traditional Chinese medicine, and absent in late mutations. Mutations were dispersed throughout the tumor, with low frequencies in one sample but high in others. This dispersal was due to cells pushing each other out during growth, advantageous for assessing mutations from limited samples. Mutations might be present low due to migration, not late emergence or selection. The study captured evolutionary dynamics up to 80,000 cells, with higher resolution allowing lower-frequency mutations to be detected.
Copsa chinensis, a pear psyll belonging to the Hemiptera order, exhibits seasonal polyphenism, manifesting as summer-form (SF) and winter-form (WF) with distinct morphological differences. Previous studies have shown that low temperature (10°C) and the receptor CTR regulate the transition from summer-form to winter in C. chin by affecting cuticle thickness and chitin content. However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism remains unknown. Bicon, also known as tanning hormone, is responsible for hardening and darkening the cuticle in insects. This study reports the novel function of Bicon and its receptor in the transition from summer to winter in C. chin. Two Bicon subunits, Cursα and Cursβ, were identified and regulated by low temperature (10°C) and CTR. Cursα and Curs formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer to winter by influencing cuticle content and thickness. Curs acts as the Bicon receptor and plays a critical role in the upstream of chitin biosynthesis pathway regulating the transition. miR-2 targets Curs to modulate the Bicon signaling in seasonal polyism. First instar nymphs of summer-form develop into third nymphs of winter to adapt to low-temperature adversity. Future research will focus on studying Bicon with other neurohorms and down-stream signaling through multiomics and RNA approaches.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that primarily occur in children. They are resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and the leading cause of brain-related death in children. Up to 80% of diagnosed children have a lysine 27 methionine (H-K27) mutation in the histone H3.3 gene, classified as H3-K27-mut. Epigenetic alterations driven by this mutation include loss of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) and increase H lysine 27 acetylation (H27ac). These alterations affect transcription programs and tumorigenesis. Targeting epigen pathways is a promising therapeutic approach. Histone deacetylase (HD) inhibitors (HDi) have shown benefit in clinical trials, but resistance develops. The MY oncogenic pathway is deregulated in H-K27 gliomas, making it an attractive target. Direct targeting MY is challenging due to lack of druggable binding sites. A novel PIN inhibitor, Sop, downregulates MY target genes in patient-derived DM cells and affects survival in an H-K-dependent manner. The combination of Sop with HDi, Vorostat, reduces cell viability by 80% in several DM lines. The treatment also downregulates prominent oncogenic pathways, including the mTOR pathway, which plays a role in gliagenesis. In vivo, the combination reduces tumor growth and downregulates mTOR. The study highlights the potential of targeting MY and HD in H-K gliomas.
Peromys leucopus (P. leopus), also known as the white-footed deermouse, is a reservoir for several zoonotic pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Powan flavivirus. A study was conducted to investigate the response of P. leopus to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Borrelia herii infection. P. leopus and Mus musculus (M. mus) were used in the study, with P. leopus being an outbred stock and M. mus an inbred. Animals were injected with LPS or saline and euthanized 4 hours later. Hematologic parameters were analyzed, and RNA-seq was performed on blood. P. leopus had a higher neutrophil count and lower nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos) expression compared to M. mus. P. leopus had a differentially expressed genes compared to M. mus, including those involved in inflammation and immune response. P. le had lower expression of interferon-gamma (Ifng) and higher expression of interleukin-1 (Il) compared to M. mus. P. le had lower expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) compared to M. mus.

Caspases (CASP) are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin (GSD), the executor of pyptosis. In humans, CAS3 and CAS7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, but CAS3 cleaves human SD (HGME) at the site DMP, while CAS7 does not. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. This study identified pypt puffer GME (TrSD) that was cleaved by both pfish CAS3/7 and human CAS3. Domain swapping between pfish and human CAS and SD showed that SD-CT and CAS7p10 determined CAS7 cleavage of SD. A key residue in CASp10 governs CAS7 substrate discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS3 but not in mammalian CAS7. Mouse CAS7 cleaved HGME but not MGME, indicating intra-spec barrier for SD cleavage CAS7 in mammals. SD is an ancient member of the SD family existing in vertebrates from tele to mammals. In humans, SD is cleaved by CAS3 at DMP but not by CAS7, which recognizes the same DD motif. CAS cleavage releases pypt-inducing fragment from association inhibitory fragment and switches death from apoptosis to pypt. This study found different human SD, puffer SD belonging to tele lineage was cleaved by CAS3 and CAS7 at site DAV to liberate py-inducing fragment. Teleost generally have two SD orthologs, SDa and SDb. Study on functions of SDa and SDb is scarce, and remains to be explored whether physiological roles played by two ortholog in fish. Executors of pypt, tele SDs are activated different mechanisms. In sole, SDb is cleaved by CAS to trigger pypt, while in zebraf SD is activated by CAS through NLR inflamome pathway. In contrast, tele SDa is cleaved by apoptotic CAS. In zraf, SD is cle by CAS to generate pyotic fragment, while tur is bi-directionally regulated by CAS3/7. In carp, SD is cle by CAS and induces pypt. The scenario of SD-mediated pypt signaling in fish is due to reason that mammals have multiple SD to induce pypt under conditions, while fish only SD induce pyotic death. Regulation different CAS may enable SD to execute orders pyotic signals. Although CAS and CAS were indistinguish in proteolysis, differed in cle of HGME and TrSD. CAS3 but CAS7 cle HGME, both CAS3 and 7 TrSD at site. NTCT swapping between HGME and SD showed chimer SD containing SD-CT cleaved human and pfish CAS7 regardless NT, while chimer SD containing HG-CT were to CAS7. Results indicate CT domain, which exerts inhibitory effect on poreing domain, is target CAS discrimination and determines cleability SD by CAS7.
This study investigated the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy individuals using a whole-brain, data-driven, multi-dimensional approach. The researchers found that ketamine resulted in five significant, bi-directional principal components (PCs) that capture 42.1% of the variance, with PC1 and PC2 explaining the most variance. PC1 was associated with increased connectivity in association networks and decreased connectivity in sensory networks, while PC2 showed the opposite pattern. The study compared ketamine's effects to psilocbin and LSD, finding higher dimensionality in ketamine compared to psybin and LSD, with no difference between LSD and psy. Ketamine's neural effects were associated with somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVAL) cortical expression, but not with mean effects. The behavioral effects of ketamine were also multi-dimensional, with two bi-directional axes capturing 41.4% of variance. PC1 was related to negative symptoms, positive, and general symptoms, while PC2 was related to poor rapport, grandiosity, hallucinations, and unusual thought. The neural-behavior PCs differentiated association and sensory networks and tracked ST and PVAL gene patterns. The study found that neurohavioral PCs were interpretable in relation to behavior and captured novel variation compared to PCs. The framework connected ketamine behavioral, neural, and molecular effects at the single-subject level, enabling predictions of individual response to ketamine without costly scans. The study used a single-blind design, with participants correctly identifying ketamine 100% of the time, and collected measures during peak effects. Future studies may use active controls, follow-up scans, and regress physiological measures.
The article presents a study on the RNA world hypothesis, proposing that RNA-like polymers were the first self-propagating units in early life's evolution. The authors test the information-maint ability of parabolic growth in multispecies models under constant population and chemostat conditions. They find that large population sizes and small replication rate differences favor stable coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error problem of exponential amplification. Sequence properties, GC content, and resource competition rate determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting fluctuations in block availability favored cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could have played a role in preserving sequences generated by abiotic synthesis and providing genetic material to early evolution of ribymes. The RNA world hypothesis is supported by nucleotide chemistry and indirect evidence from organisms, but initial weaknesses, such as lack of reliable replication mechanism and loss of heritable information, have led to refined models. A promising suggestion is prior template replication catalyzed by RNA polymer ribyme, genetic and catalytic functions distributed among short modules. Replication of short modules with catalytic properties could have occurred without ribyme, driven by template-directed nonenzym mechanism. Templated enzyme-free replication of nucleic acid oligomers from abiotic polymerization may have contributed to emergence of oligonucleides during preotic evolution. Activated oligonucleides can act as catalysts for nonenzym replication of RNA with fidelity to sustain genome large enough to encode ribymes. Enzyme-free replication of oligomers with high variability was attainable from prebi chemistry, a critical level of diversity associated information could be preserved under competition among replic types with different abilities. Parabolic dynamics, a kinetic observed in nonenzym self-repating, has been proposed to sustain preotic genetic information. In this, growth is subexponential due to increased stability of template complex rate, promoting parabolic. Replicating populations displaying par growth are prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, promoting coexistence. Parabolic can sustain unlimited competing species in infinite population limit, but evolution of Darwin type necessitates exponential amplification, limiting coexistence. The study aims to remedy deficiencies by quantifying heritable-maint potential of finite RNA replicators displaying parabolic modeled stochastic dynamics, considering replic sequences, error, and energetic constraints.
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, targets the human respiratory tract and lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress. Upon entering the host cells, the viral RNA genome is translated into overlapping polyproteins, pp1 and ppab, which are then proteolytically processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (Nps) involved in viral replication and assembly. Nps also disrupt host processes and facilitate propagation. The maturation of Nps is executed by viral proteases N5 and N3. N5 cleaves ppb at 11 sites to release itself and N4-N16, while N3 cleaves pp at multiple sites to release N1-N4. N3 and N5 have also cleaved host proteins linked to immune response and survival. N3 and N5 are essential for replication and characterized drug targets among coronaviruses. The antiviral Paxlo, a reversible inhibitor of N5 protease, reduces replication and disease in COVID-19 patients. Purification of SARS-2 proteins from cells identified interaction between catalytic N5 and human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1), a host enzyme for prevalent post-transcription modification of tRNAs. Cells infected with SARS-2 exhibit decreased TR1 levels and tRNA modifications consistent with TR cleavage by N5. N5 cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching SARS-2 polyprotein cleavage consensus. A mutation in the sequence inhibits N-dependent TR cleavage. TR1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA activity and cannot rescue t modification in TR1-deficient cells. Compared to wild-type cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with S-2 exhibit reduced intracellular RNA. These findings provide evidence that N5-dependent cleavage of TR1 and perturbation tRNA patterns contribute to SARS-2 pathogenesis.
The study investigated the hypothesis of "accidental virulence," which proposes that selection for traits beneficial in the environment can lead to the evolution of virulence in microbes. Researchers used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, which is an opportunistic pathogen that can infect immunocompromised individuals. They selected for adherence to a plastic surface, a common in industrial and medical settings, and found that this led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence. The study demonstrated that selection on one trait can generate correlated traits associated with virulence, a feature of organism evolution. The coincidental-accidental vir hypothesis suggests that harsh conditions may lead to traits predispose microbes to vir, but environmental conditions can also favor collective or multicellular phenotypes. The study found that nutrient conditions may have affected pseudyhal growth but was not the main driver of multicellular phenotypes, rather adherence led to evolution of multicellularity. Previous research on environmental isolates found no correlation between phenotypes assayed, and a lab strain capable of aggregative behaviors had its own set of genes. However, there was overlap in requirement of F11 and regulators. The study used two genetic backgrounds with ~50,000 heterozygous sites and ~25,000 SNPs, possibly containing variation in canonical pathways for hypermultic strains. Pseudyhal growth evolved independently of other phenotypes, and future research will investigate sorting genetic variation and mutations. The study demonstrated role of sex in increasing adaptation in fungi and the importance of understanding emergence of opportunistic pathogens. The World Health Organization prioritized 19 fungal pathogens, 11 of which live in environment, including three in highest group. The study unclear trait associated with increased vir was adherence, multicellular, or hypermultic. The study demonstrated that selection for dual trait in environment can lead to virulence and pathogenic.
Proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) are common drivers of biomolecular condens and prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Researchers used a coarse-grained model, Mp, to quantify the impact of amino mutations on the stability of 140 PL mutants from six proteins (hnPA, T43, F, US, ERS, RB14, and T1). Simulations revealed scaling laws that quantify the range of change in critical temperature of PL as a function of number and type of amino sequence. These laws are consistent with physico properties of mutations and extend across the family, suggesting scaling can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens. Biomolecular condens are multicomponent systems with non-random compositions and distinct physchemical environments defined by collective behavior of components. Phase separation has emerged as a mechanism for formation of biomolecular condens, with intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDRs) contributing to multival and phase capacity of naturally occurring proteins. IDRs are characterized by amino sequences of low complexity and enriched in aromatic residues, such as PL of RNA-binding proteins, prone to form condens that behave like viscous fluids. PL of naturally occurring proteins, such as Fused Sar (F), Transactivation DNA-binding 43 (T-), and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A (hnPA) have transitioned from liquid condens into arrested and glasses over time. Arrested states have been postulated as precursors of protein and amyloids. Understanding factors that regulate ability of PL to phase is crucial, as conjectured to facilitate aggregation. Biom condens are networked fluids sustained by multivalent macromolecules interconnecting more than two partners. Factors that increase molecularency give rise to densely liquid networks and stable condens. PL multival has been promoted by presence aromatic residues, which enable associative interactions and cation- interactions. The range of coexistence of PL condens has changed significantly in response to mutations involving aromatic residues. Quantitative phase diagrams for set of hnPA-ID variants with simulations demonstrated tyrosine drives associative interactions stronger than phenalanine, arginine effects are context-specific and lysine destabilizes PL-PL interactions. A study investigated whether scaling laws can predict changes in critical of PL as function of amino sequence. Scaling laws describe relationships between system variables, such as composition and parameters, providing theory to predict and interpret complex phenomena like phase. For PL behavior, laws provide quantitative to analyze alterations in amino composition and critical parameters, crucial for understanding biological systems. The objective was to discern scaling that capture variations PL critical as function sequence. A systematic approach varied amino sequence of PL to determine phase changes with compositional perturb. Each type of mutation analyzed defined and tested three scaling laws, illustrating relationship between critical temperature changes and number of amino. First law is linear between quantities, second hypothesizes changes proportional to fraction mutated, and third law proportional number inversely to length. Scaling for aromatic deletions predicted destabilizing effect linearly amplified by number and screened by square of length, indicating disruption perated network sustaining condens. Condens made longer PL more robust against deletions, by construction, each aromatic represents smaller percentage totalency. Findings highlighted crucial role Arg in critical PLens, scaling predicted destabil effect inversely proportional length and linearly with number. Notably, amino composition PL have been explained stickers-and-spacers framework, aromatic and arginine proposed stickers contributing stability via interactions, but works argue all residues have effects various contexts. Data suggests black-white delineation not appropriate, certain residues, such as Tyr or Arg have larger impact, while others smaller, like spacers interspersed among stickers.
This study proposes a novel approach to predict individual traits from brain dynamics using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a kernel-based method. The HMM is a probabilistic generative model that assumes observed time-series data is generated by a sequence of hidden states, which are modeled as multivariate distributions of mean and covariance. The study used resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, which contains imaging and demographic data from 120 healthy young adults. The HMM was fit to the concatenated timeseries of all subjects, and subject-specific versions were estimated through dual estimation. Three kernels were constructed: naive, naive-normalized, and Fisher, which map H parameters into distinct spaces. The Fisher kernel preserves the structure of the HMM and calculates how to change group-level parameters to better explain a subject's timeseries. The study compared the Fisher kernel to naive, naive-normal, and Kull-Leibler (KL) divergence, and time-averaged models, including KL divergence, log-Euclidean, Ridge, Ridge, Elastic, and Selected edges. The Fisher kernel outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The study found that state features are more important than transition features for predictions and that the Fisher can recover group differences in transition when overshadowed by state parameters. The approach can be applied to other modalities, such as MEG or EEG, and extended to include temporally recurring patterns. The study highlights the importance of accounting for the structure of the underlying model and assessing not only accuracy but also errors and robustness when using brain dynamics to predict traits.
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRR2) variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its substrates, including Rab10 and Rab12. The molecular mechanisms regulating LK activity have been poorly defined. A targeted siRNA screen identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LK-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods, Rab12 was shown to be recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to local and LK-dependent Rab phosphorylation. Pathogenic variants, including LK R144G and V35DN, increased LK localization to lysosomes and pT Rab levels. These data suggest a conserved mechanism where Rab facilitates L recruitment and phosphorylation of LK substrates on lysosomes in response to damage or disease-associated variants. LK activity is increased in pathogenic variants and sporadic PD, but mechanisms of regulation and response to lysosomal stress unclear. Rab12 regulates L-dependent phosphorylation and localization of L on lysosomes. LK variants, including R144 and V35, increase L localization to lysosomes and p Rab levels, suggesting a general mechanism for increased L activity by variants and stress. Additional mechanisms beyond proximity between L and substrates may contribute to phosphorylation upon damage. Studies in A549 cells, Rab regulates L-dependent phosphorylation and localization of on lysosomes. L variants, including R and V, increase localization lys and p levels, suggesting a conserved mechanism for increased activity by variants and stress. L activity is increased in pathogenic and sporadic PD, but mechanisms regulation and response lys stress unclear. Rab regulates L-dependent phosphorylation and localization of on lysosomes L variants, including and V, increase lys and p, suggesting conserved for increased by variants and stress.
Researchers have developed a novel method for analyzing cell cycle dynamics in adherent and non-adherent cells using a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) technology. The FUCCI CA 2 sensor combines two fluorescent proteins, mCh and mV, to demarcate cell phases G1, S, and G2/M. The method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have different cycle durations. The researchers treated NB4 cells with suboptimal concentrations of CD inhibitors, paloclib, PF-736, and riboclib, and observed significant G-prolongation in the G phase. The total duration of one cell cycle was quantified as 21.5 ± 6.5 hr for NB4 and 24.0 ± 7.8 hr for Kas-1. The method was able to discriminate cycle differences in leukemic cells with various subopt doses of CD inhibitors. The researchers also investigated the impact of nanostructured surfaces on cellular expression and found no significant transcriptomic alterations. The protocol is feasible for biological investigations without affecting the transcriptomic profile of cells. A complete workflow for cell analysis was developed, including image processing, tracking, filtering, and cycle identification, and characterization. The pipeline was applied to adherent and non-adherent cells using Fiji and R software, widely used by the imaging and analysis community. Scripts were made publicly available for customization. The protocol allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per condition using image and data pipelines automatically. Cells were plated in 24-well plates, infected with lentiviral carrying FUCCI CA 2, and selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Glass multiwell plates were coated with supersonic beam deposition (SCD) technology, producing nanostructured titania films that promote adhesion and immobilization of cells. Cells were treated with CD inhibitors, and total RNA was extracted for RNA sequencing. Images were acquired with a Leica Thunderager, and processed using a custom Fiji macro, including flat correction, blur, and background subtraction. Tracking was performed using TrackMate, and a machine learning approach was employed to assess trackability. A dataset of manually annotated tracks was used, and a random forest model was trained, achieving AUC 0.971 and sensitivity 0.897, specificity 0.974, and accuracy 0.905. The model was used to predict unlabeled data, and a semi-supervised forest was trained, achieving AUC 0.975. The pipeline was implemented in R using Tidymodel and Tverse. Time-like information was generated using Fiji, and missing frames were imputed with exponential moving average. Smoothing was applied, and min scaling was used to normalize tracks. The model was encapsulated as an API in Docker, enabling deployment. Ed pulse was performed, and flow cytometry and imaging were used for cell cycle profiling. Confocal images were captured, and a Python pipeline was used for segmentation. Data was analyzed using RStudio.
This study investigated the relationship between brain size and socio-ecological variables in 16 primate species using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3D reconstructions. The results showed that the size of the prefrontal pole (FP) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLP) regions, involved in metacognition and working memory, respectively, were related to socioecological variables. The FP was more sensitive to population density, a proxy for social complexity, and daily distance traveled, a proxy for foraging complexity. The DFC was related to daily distance and to a lesser extent to population. The study suggests that FP and DFC are involved in both social and ecological challenges in primates. The results are in line with the social and ecological brain hypotheses, which propose that social and ecological constraints drive brain evolution. The study used a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) approach to evaluate the influence of socioec variables on neuroatom across species, accounting for phylogenetic relations. The best model for FP included body, daily distance, and population, and for DFC included body, daily distance, and population. The leave-out procedure confirmed the reliability of the models. The study suggests that FP and DFC are involved in both social and ecological challenges in primates. The results are in line with the social and ecological hypotheses, which propose that social and ecological drive brain evolution.

This study developed a novel method called fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with deconvolution (F-ID) to visualize myofils with a fluorescence microscope. F-ID images have high resolution and contrast, enabling automated measurements of myil size and myil number. The method uses common lab instruments and open-source software, making it accessible to a broad range of investigators. The study used F-ID to investigate the radial growth of muscle in response to mechanical loading, a fundamental question in the field of muscle growth. Two models, chronic overload in mice and progressive resistance exercise in humans, induced significant growth in SER1 fibers, but not myil hypertrophy was not consistently observed, and no correlation between growth and myil hypert was detected. However, myillogenesis, the formation of new myils, was significant in all fiber types, with positive correlation between growth and mylogenesis. This suggests mylogenesis is a major driver of radial response, conserved across models. The mechanisms of loading-induced mylogenesis are unknown, but groundwork for two models has been established: myil splitting and de novo myogenesis. Future studies should test these models to advance the field, with F-ID enabling time- and cost-effective studies.
The study investigated the effects of mutations in the SNAP25 gene, which encodes the synaptotagmin-25 protein, a key component of the SNARE complex involved in neurotransmitter release. Three mutations, I67, V48, and D166, were identified in patients with epilepsy, intellectual disability, and movement disorders. I67 is located in the SNARE bundle, while V48 and D166 are in the primary interface with synaptagmin-1. I67 destabilizes the SN complex, while V48 and D166 reduce binding to synaptagmin-1. In vitro, I67 showed reduced Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent fusion, while V48 and D166 had impaired Ca+-dependent and increased Ca+-independent fusion. Co-expression of WT and I67 resulted in intermediate survival, while V48 and D166 had reduced survival. Patch-clamp measurements showed reduced spontaneous and evoked release in I67, while V and D166 had increased spontaneous and reduced evoked release. Sucrose application revealed reduced R size in I67, while V and D166 had reduced and increased R size. The energy barrier for fusion was increased in I67, while V and D166 had decreased. The I67 mutation had a dominant-negative effect, while V and D166 were incompletely dominant. The study suggests that mutations in SNAP can lead to distinct phenotypes, including loss-of-function in priming and gain-of-function in fusion.
Researchers analyzed data from 30 countries and found that disciplines with a higher proportion of women have lower research quality evaluations and lower funding rates. This effect is observed in both men and women, and is robust to age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures. The study builds on previous findings that women's work is valued less, regardless of who performs it. Many studies have shown women's research is evaluated as lower than men's (Brower and James, 2020; West et al., 2013) and women's funding rates are lower than men's (Witan et al.,2019;Gan,2019 Brower and James,202) in terms of number and size of grants (Gan,201; Ley,2008). Evaluations affect career aspects like hiring, promotion, and funding. Other studies explored explanations for the gendered pattern in evaluation, such as societal, institutional, and academic factors, including bias (Shen,2013). The study finds a strong correlation between evaluated quality and gender balance of researcher's discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations. This is robust to bibliometric differences across disciplines. Funding rates display a similar correlation. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines have lower rates. Academic disciplines differ in ways like publication rates, citation, and h-indices. There are norms for number of co-authors, order, and attributions. Gender is not constant across disciplines. There are fewer women in STEM, and women use qualitative methods rather than quantitative (Shen,201). Research suggests interactions between individual and discipline characteristics. Higher 'expectations' in a discipline relate to lower women entering (Leslie et al.,2015) and research is a contributor to lower success of African/Black scientists (ope et.,201). Women score lower on evaluations, publish less, receive citations, and h-indices, have fewer firstships, and acknowledgements, and credit for innovations, and awards, particularly prestigious, are less given to women (James et.,201;eho,202). Research suggests women react differently to change in journal prestige (ch et.,202). The study shows a correlation: higher proportion of women in a discipline is correlated with lower research evaluations and funding for everyone in the field. Independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers and 30 countries look at research success and scores. Possible account for researcher characteristics like age, institution, and publishing. Consistently, researchers in male-dominated have higher success and research scores than in female-dominated. The study looks at country scores of individual researchers. ANZ PBR scores individual-level data on 18,371 research assessments of 13,555 individuals in AN for PBR. Assessments were at three points in 200,201,201,201. Staff at eight universities were given a score 0-700 based on portfolio over 6. Individuals over 200 were considered active. Scores by local and international experts on 14 panels were used to allocate funding. Many were present more than one round, but analyzed each separately to examine the link between score and gender of discipline. A linear model predicts research score using variables, particularly gender of discipline. The best model includes gender, age, institute, and interactions. The best for all three points was Score∼Age+Institute+Gender∗men. Predicts individuals in male-dominated have higher scores than female-dominated. Even accounting for age, men have higher scores than women. The difference between male-dominated and female is larger than men and women in any discipline. Figure 1 shows raw scores of each discipline by gender in each period. The line is expected output for a 50-year male or female at University of Canterbury. The model predictions are adjusted for age, so appear different from raw data. A 50-year researcher in 201 at UC, and age terms in the model, a different researcher at another would show
Researchers have developed a new strategy called "P editing" that enables the conversion of protein-protein interactions into genome editing events. This approach uses a three-component system consisting of crRNA-2, petrRNA, and Lambda-MCP, where cr-2 and petrRNA are designed to dimerize and form an active peg, and Lambda-M is a protein that brings cr-2 and petr into proximity. The strategy was tested in HEK293 cells with various protein-protein interactions, including MS-MCP and Box-Lambda, epitope-antody, and split-GFP. The results showed that protein-protein interactions can induce genome editing, with efficiencies ranging from 2-53% to 15%. The strategy was also adapted to base editing with three editors, C2, C4, and A8, and showed comparable editing efficiencies to standard sgRNA. Additionally, the strategy was combined with AD-based RNA to control genome editing, where the cargo of AD-RNA is a protein that brings cr- and pet into proximity. The results showed 11.6% editing, significantly higher than without the AD-based system. However, the efficiency and specificity of the strategy may degrade when combining multiple modules. The strategy has potential for recording biological events in living cells, as it can be used to capture protein-protein interactions and convert them into genome output. However, there are challenges to overcome, including testing in additional cell types, improving efficiency and specificity, understanding protein-protein interactions, and developing multiplex sensors. The strategy uses a pair of aptamers and protein binders, limiting multiplex protein-protein pairs, and orthogonal pairs need to be identified. Overall, the strategy has potential for genome editing physiological protein-protein interactions in multiplex.
This study investigated the mechanism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in increasing the maximum conductance (Gmax) of the slow-rectifier (IKs) current in the KCQ/KC1 channel, a key contributor to the repolarization of the ventricular action potential. PUFs are known to activate IK channels by binding to two sites, one at the voltage sensor (Site I) and one at the pore (Site II), resulting in an increase in Gmax and a shift in the voltage of activation. The study focused on the mechanism of the G effect at Site II, where PU binding to positively charged lysine at position 326 was previously suggested to be critical. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that another residue, aspartic acid 301, is also important for the G effect. Single-channel recordings showed that PU decreased the latency to opening and increased the open probability (Po) of the channel, with no change in single conductance. The increase in Po was mainly due to an increase in non-empty sweeps when PU was applied. The study proposed that the effect of PU involved conformation changes in the selectivity filter following PU binding to residues 326 and 301 at the pore, which delimit a crevice that changes in size in structures with S4 activated or resting. Mutations in residues known to stabilize the selectivity of potassium channels, YF, D, T, and P, reduced the G effect of PU. The study used the latest KCQ structure with S4 in the resting state, showing a different conformation of the pore and select filter compared to structures with activated S4. The select filter in this structure had a non-conductive conformation, whereas structures with activated S4 had a conductive conformation. The study hypothesized that the effect of PU in increasing Gmax is linked to their ability to stabilize the pore in conductive state, promoting interactions between residues in the select filter that stabilize the channel. The cre between 326 and 301 is present in structures with S4 activated but not in structures with S resting, and PU binding in this cre stabilizes the network interactions forming the conduct form of selectivity, resulting in a stable conduct pore and increased G.
Researchers have identified 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF) as a direct inhibitor of pyridoxal 5-phosphate phosphatase (PDX), an enzyme that controls the levels of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PL), the coenzymatically active form of vitamin B6, in the brain. They found that 7,8HF increases PL levels in hippocampal neurons in a PDP-dependent manner, validating P as a drable target to control intracellular PL levels in the brain. The study also presents high-resolution 7,8HF-PD coystal structures that will facilitate the design of more potent, efficacious, and selective P inhibitors in the future. These molecules might improve control intracellular PL levels and help elucidate the contribution of PL to the pathophysiology of brain disorders. The expression of P is substantially upregulated in hippoci of middle-aged mice, suggesting that vitamin B supplementation alone may not elevate intracellular levels under conditions where P is hyperactive. The discovery of 7,8 as P inhibitor was unexpected, as numerous studies have reported effectiveness in brain models, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism. PL deficiency is thought to contribute to these conditions, but PL-dependent processes have not been considered in the context of 8-induced effects. 8 was initially discovered as a small-molecule TrkB agonist with BDN-metic activity, but its mechanism of action is incompletely understood, and targets other than Tr have remained elusive. The identification as P inhibitor indicates that  may modulate vitamin-dependent processes and P could be explored as pharmacological entry into disorders.
In C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric gonad structure, guided by the migration of distal tip (D) cells (DTCs) derived from somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z1 and Z4. The polarity of Z and Z is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizz receptor and Wnt proteins C-1, C-2, and EGL-20, with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, C-2 promotes polarity in both Z and Z, while C- promotes and polarity in Z and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits polarity in both Z and Z. In lin-17;C-2 mutants, Z and Z show reversed polarity, leading to mis-migration of Ds. The mis-migration of Ds in lin-;C-2 is caused by the reversal of Z polarity, as Z-derived Ds migrate posteriorly. The migratory direction of Ds is not correlated with the polarity of the D mother cell, as Z-derived Ds can migrate anteriorly or posteriorly. Ectopically positioned Ds can migrate randomly, irrespective of Wnt mutations. The migratory ability of Ds may help their distal migration. The regulation of S polarity by W signaling is crucial for normal D migration and mirrorymmetric organogenesis by positioning Ds at the distal edge of the gon. lin-17/F functions in a W-independent manner to control S polarity, as the D phenotype of lin-;C2 and lin-5 was rescued by ΔD-LIN-17. S polarity is normal in quintuple mutants with mutations in all W genes. seam cells are polarized in quintuple mutants, while unpolar in triple mutants lin-5-cam-1or. vang-1 does not function with LIN-17, as most mutants have two gon arms. Fz interacts with Disveled in PC regulation, but not with LIN-17. Z-derived D can migrate in c- and lin- mutants, indicating ectopically D can misigrate through germ. The migratory ability of D may help further dist migration. The regulation of S by W plays a role in ensuring D migration and mirror organ by positioning D at the dist edge.
This study aimed to investigate the diversity of mechanisms of fluconazole (FL) resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by evolving yeast to different concentrations and combinations of FL and radicol (RAD) in 12 experiments. A library of 300,000 barcoded yeast was created by transforming the landing strain SHA with a barcode plasmid, and 14 transformations were pooled to create a library with 300,000 unique barcodes. Each evolution started with 300,000 barcoded yeast, and 1,000-2 cells were sampled from each evolution for fitness experiments and whole-genome sequencing. Fitness was inferred from log-linear change in barcode frequency over time, and 774 lineages passed a threshold of 500 counts across time. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 122 colonies, and 53 had unique barcodes, with 51 having at least one nucleotide mutation in genes. Variant calling was done using GAT, and annotated with SnpEff. The study identified 6 clusters of mutants with distinct fitness profiles using UMAP and hierarchical clustering, which were robust to different analysis methods. Clustering was consistent with follow-up genotyping and phenotyping studies. Mutants in cluster 1 had mutations in SUR and UPC genes, while cluster 2 and 3 had mutations in PDR and PDR genes. Cluster 1 had lower fitness in multidrug conditions, while cluster 2 and 3 had higher fitness. Mutants in cluster 1 were diploid, while cluster 2 and 3 were haploid. Mutants in cluster 1 had lower growth rate in multidrug, while cluster 2 and 3 had higher. Mutants in cluster 1 had higher ploidy, while cluster 2 and 3 had lower. Mutants in cluster 1 had lower fitness in multidrug, while cluster 2 and 3 had higher. Mutants in cluster 1 had higher ploidy, while cluster 2 and 3 had lower.

The article discusses the phenomenon of central bias or contraction, where the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy of the brain's ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. Recent results from a delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought, with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) playing a key role in modulating bias. The study proposes a model of the circuit involved in generating behavior, consisting of two continuous attractor sub-networks representing working memory (WM) and PPC. The model shows that contraction and short-term sensory biases emerge in WM as a result of inputs from PPC. Contractions are not due to separate mechanisms but an effect of errors in WM occurring due to persisting memory of stimuli. The model suggests that contraction in paradigms may not reflect explicit learning of regularities or attraction to the mean on individual trials but an effect at the level of performance when errors are made according to recent experiences. The study also shows that contraction can be observed in the activity of WM prior to decision-making, similar to delayed estimation paradigms. The model captures the behavior of humans and rats on the task, with adaptation timescale in PPC affecting the extent of short-term bias. A generalized linear model (GL) analysis suggests dissociable short and long biases may be present in behavior. The study proposes an alternative interpretation of GL results in Lieder et al., 2019, where increased (reduced) weight for long-term in ASD (D) subjects can be an effect of larger (smaller) window time of short biases without a double dissociation mechanism. The model is composed of two populations of neurons, PPC and WM, each organized as continuous attractors with different timescales. The networks are coupled through excitatory connections from PPC to WM. The model predicts how pattern errors change when the distribution of stimuli is manipulated at the level of presented or through dynamics. Results from human psychophysical experiments agree with predictions. The model captures temporal of short attraction and repulsion observed in tasks, emerging from neuronal adaptation but amplit crucially depend on task parameters. The study suggests that attractive and repulsive effects may be suboptimal in laboratory settings but necessary in natural environments for perceptual continuity.
Researchers investigated the role of PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and its potential as a target for therapy. They found that PIM is epigenetically repressed and genetically deleted in human lung cancer, contributing to resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IC) and chemotherapy. Using a mouse model of lung cancer, they showed that systemic administration of nanoparticle-encapsulated PIM-expression plasmids (nanoPIM) reverses the phenotypes caused by PIM repression and induces remission of lung tumors in most mice without increasing toxicity. They also found that nanoPIM enhances the efficacy of anti-P-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, leading to complete remission in most animals. The combination of nanoPIM, anti-P-1, and chemother drugs showed the strongest effect, reducing tumor burden and causing remission in 60% of mice. PIM nanotherapy is tumor-specific and safe, with no toxicity observed in animals. The study establishes a novel combination therapy with high efficacy and low toxicity for lung cancer, particularly refractory lung. PD-1/P-L blockade immunotherapy has joined chemotherapy as standard for lung and other cancers, but most patients do not benefit. Combinations of IC with other therapies, including chemother drugs, are being tested to expand benefit. A synergy and better has been observed in preclinical models and clinical studies, but further improvement is needed. The study shows PIM nanotherapy efficacy and safety, inducing remission in most animals when combined with anti-P- and chem drugs. Most lung tumors have low TIL and decreased PD1, contributing to resistance. Chemotherapy increases T and PD1, but not MHC, limiting synergy. P nanotherapy induces MHC and prevents MDR and survival genes, sensitizing cells to cytotoxic drugs and immune cells. The combination of nanoIM, anti-P, and drugs resulted in remission most animals and dramatic reduction in remaining. P nanotherapy is tumor-specific and safe, with no toxicity observed. The study identifies genetic deletions as major mechanism of PIM repression in lung and PIM as hapins tumor suppressor for lung therapy.
To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this physiological food evaluation system, which monitors ingested nutrients and influences food response, are not fully understood. Researchers established a low-quality food assay and found that heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli), a low-sugar food, triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune response, encouraging animals to avoid low-quality food. The system depends on the UPR (IRE-1/XBP-1)-innate immunity (PM-1/p38K) axis, particularly neuronal function, which regulates feeding behaviors. Animals can adapt to low-quality environments through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPR-PM-1 regulated response by increasing vitamin biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress pathway as a physiological evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, enhancing survival in natural environments.

Food is essential for survival, growth, and fitness of all animals. To adapt to fluctuating environments with a range of food sources, animals have developed an evaluation system. This enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoid low-quality or toxic, maximizing survival. Various neuron systems have evolved to evaluate food through vision, olfactory, and gustatory senses. Besides these systems facilitate feeding decisions, animals may initiate stress programs to detect toxins and trigger food behaviors. This could be one physiological quality system that monitors the nutritional status of consumed. However, the events in cellular responses involved in evaluating specific nutrients and mechanisms connecting signaling to behaviors are largely unexplored. Cellular response through UPR and PM-1/p38-dependent immunity to pathogens have been studied, but functions in sensing nutrients remain unclear.

Vitamin is an essential micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans due to the loss of an enzyme in biosynthetic pathway. Animals obtain vitamin from diet and possibly from microbes. Vitamin is an antioxidant and cofactor for biosynthetic and regulatory enzymes. It is required for biosynthesis collagen, L-carnine, and neurotransmitters. Vitamin is associated with human diseases scur, immune, and cardiovascular. Animals having robust evaluation systems to detect vitamin levels could impact survival in the wild. However, the involvement of cellular response in this system remains unexplored In this study, using the low-quality assay, we elucidated the mechanism by which cellular response operates as a food system. This assesses deficiency in-glucose food and subsequent vitamin content through UPR innate immunity. This promotes animals to leave low-quality and is critical for survival in environments.

Previous studies have shown heat-killed E. coli (HK-E coli) a low-quality source that cannot support growth C elegans larvae. Supplementation with vitamin B can restore growth. Here, we found sugar in HK-E coli induces UPR-immune and avoidance in C eleg. Given this, we investigated whether supplementation could promote growth fed HK coli. Surprisingly, supplementing HK coli with carbohydrates did not support development. However, we found carbohydrates critical inhibiting UPR-imm induced by deficiency HK coli. These suggest HK coli induces stress and avoidance in animals, which can be inhibited by-gl supplementation. This implies animals evaluate sugar deficiency HK coli through activation UPR and responses.

We discovered-gl supplementation HK induced UPR, immune, response, and avoidance. Simultaneously, vitamin, synthesized glucuron pathway using-gl as precursor, contributes neuroprotection, immune defense, and inhib inflammatory stress. Led to investigate whether biosynthesis involved evaluating low food using-gl. We found animals fed live, which produce more VC exhibit higher levels. However, results show animals maintain VC when ideal food compared low HK. In contrast, supplementing HK or E coli-yR can improve VC and inhibit UPR-imm. These indicate-gl boosts ability to adapt unfavorable environments increasing VC, not favorable conditions.

The cellular response is a slow, multi-step process after ingestion. Disruption homeostasis by low or toxic
A class of biomolecules, carbohydrates, play crucial roles in various biological processes, including energy supply, signaling, and immune responses. However, their direct modulation of major targets, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCs), remains unknown. This study employed P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover sugar activation of GPCs. Integrating molecular simulation with study, a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar binding site on P2 was identified, and UDP-glucose activating the receptor by bridging transmembrane (TM) helices 2 and 7. A conserved bridging chain (K2.60-D.64-K7.35-E36) was identified to distinguish UDP-sug, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galose, UDP-gluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. This chain was also conserved in P2 purceptor 12 (P2). Three UDP-sug agonists were designed for P2, expanding understanding of activation purergic and providing insights for carbohydrate development of GPCs. The study revealed conserved carbohydrate motif in P2 and P2, extending understanding of carbohydrate regulation of GPCs. Molecular models of sugarotides provide details for activation and recognition of receptors, inspiring carbohydrate development of GPC.
This study investigates the role of glial cells in regulating the self-renewal and proliferation of neural stem cells (NS) in the Drosoph larval brain. The authors show that glial ferritin, a protein produced by glial cells, is essential for the selfnew and proliferation of NS. Ferritin supplies iron to NS for energy production, which is critical for their selfnew and proliferation. Knocking down ferritin in glial cells leads to a decrease in NS number and proliferation, while overexpressing ferritin rescues this phenotype. Ferritin is transported from glial to NS via vesicles. The study also shows that ferritin is required for tumor development, and blocking ferr suppresses tumor growth in Doph and mice. Ferr is essential for Fe clusters in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (Oxos) cycles, which provide energy for NS selfnew and proliferation. The study proposes a bicellular iron homeostasis between NS and glial cells, distinct from classic cellular and systemic iron homeostasis. Ferritin is stored in glial cells and allocated to NS as needed, relieving NS from producing ferr and risk of iron-induced oxidative stress. Glial can clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring normal NS function during development. The study suggests that bicellular homeasis may exist in other stem cells and niches, and that NS communicate with gl cells to regulate ferr production. Ferr is transported via ferritin in Doph brain, but direct evidence is lacking due to technical limitations. The study provides insights into the role of ferritin in regulating NS selfnew and proliferation, and its potential as a target for tumor suppression.
This study investigated the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality on a population level in the US during the pandemic. The authors analyzed vital statistics to understand the role of death certificate changes during the pandemic and putative differences in patterns between types of cancer. They found that cancer mortality rose by only 3% over pre-pand baseline, corresponding to 13,600 excess deaths, with the largest increase in hematological cancer (7%). In contrast, diabetes and Alzheimer's showed significant elevations of 37% and 19, respectively. The authors simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition, and found that observed differences are primarily explained by life expectancy, with deadly cancers competing the risk of death from COVID-19. The dominant factors for COVID-19 mortality have been age, male, gender, and chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Cancer has been identified as a high-risk condition in case-control and cohort studies, but results are conflicting. Observational studies provide a mixed picture of cancer as a COVID-19 risk, with several reporting controlling for factors such as age a challenge. Cancer is often considered a single disease despite diversity of conditions and patients. Further evidence comes from population analysis of vital statistics, showing no elevation in cancer deaths concurrent with COVID-19 waves, in contrast to sharp rise from other chronic diseases. Several countries, including Sweden, Italy, Latvia, Brazil, England, and Wales, reported stable or decreasing cancer mortality during the pandemic. The study analyzed US vital statistics in detail to understand potential of death coding changes during pandemic and explored differences patterns between types of cancer. They considered death listing cancer as underlying cause of death or anywhere on death certificate. Assuming high propensity to attribute primary COVID-19 during pandemic, individuals with both cancer and COVID-19 near death would be coded as COVID-19, but cancer still captured in data, analysis should control changes death coding practices. The authors obtained ICD-coded certificate data from US for 2014-2020 and compiled time series by cause of death for underlying and multiple cause mortality. They considered 10 causes, including diabetes, Alzheimer, ischemic heart disease, kidney disease, and six types of cancer (all-cause, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, lung, and hematological). Chose specific to illustrate conditions with 5-year survival low (13% and 25, respectively, for pancreatic and lung) and high (65 and 91, respectively, for colorectal and breast). Hematological (67 5-year rate) included due to immune suppression with malignancy and treatment. Compared patterns with timing COVID-19 waves, national and state-level counts of COVID-19 from CDC. Analysis state-level reveals variable timing, intensity, and number COVID-19 across US during 2020. Focused on periods with COVID-activity and association with cancer, identified large states with well-defined waves. New York, California, and Texas experienced unique waves. Established weekly model for expected mortality absence pandemic by modeling trends and season in pre-pand data. Computed excess as difference observed and model-predict baseline. Summed estimates to excess pandemic and each wave. In addition to absolute effects pandemic, calculated relative by excess dividing mortality baseline. Nationally found drop in cancer deaths spring, although not significant. Similar decline seen specific types. Reasoned early drop UC deaths explained changes coding, turned MC to mortality. Series MC showed significant in all waves. Pattern seen MC series colorectal, breast, and hematological. Excess was modest with 13,600 cancer in 202, representing 3 elevation baseline. Largest increase hematological at 7, statistically 360 excess.
The study investigates the role of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids) from eukotic chromosomes. The Smc/6 complex is a member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair, replication, and telomere maintenance. The study shows that Sm/6 binds to R-loops formed during gene transcription and telomere regulation and promotes their removal via stimulation of RNase2 enzymatic activity. This is a previously uncharacterized function of Sm/6 in genome stability and has implications for health and disease in eukary organisms. Yeast strains were used in the study, with relevant genotypes listed in Table 1. Growth conditions, genetic analysis, and strain creation were performed as described in Sano et al., 2020. Double mutants were created by mating haploid mutants to produce heterozygous diploids. Sporulation and dissection of diploids were performed at 23°C.

AID-expressing strains were created by transforming tagged Rad52 with ESCLE-HAID plasmid. Plasmids used are listed in Table 2. Chromatin spreads were performed as Grubb et al., 201 with modifications. Cells were fixed, lysed, and spread on slides. Slides were washed, blocked, and incubated with monoclonal S.6 antibody, followed by Cy-conjugated goat antibody. Nuclei were counterstained with VectShield and DAPI. Images were acquired using Nikon Ti microscopy. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ. Human SMC/ complex was purified by triple affinity and size chromatography. Yeast were grown, lysed, and passed through high-pressure homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged and passed through Ni-NT resin. Complex was eluted and dialyzed, quantified, and stored. DNA oligos were labeled with ATP-γP and annealed to complementary strands. Substrates were separated, excised, purified, and eluted. Substrates were quantified using scintillation. R-substrates were synthesized by annealing labeled RNA with DNA and DNA strands. D-substrate was generated by annealing labeled DNA with DNA and DNA strands. Single-strand was used as control. EMSA was performed to determine binding of SMC and condin. Reactions were incubated, loaded, and electrophoresed. Gels were dried, visualized autoradi. Specificity was evaluated by incubating with unlabeled poly. Quantification was performed using Image. Data was fitted to Hill equation. RN assays were performed in Buffer.

Co-IP was performed as Pastic et al., with modifications Yeast were grown, washed, snaprozen, and stored. Beads were washed, incubated with anti-St antibody or IgG. Lysates were cleared, split, incubated, washed, and resuspended. Proteins were separated, transferred, and analyzed immunobted.
The study aimed to investigate the relationship between neural filtering and behavioral changes in listening in a cohort of 105 middle-aged and older adults over a 2-year period. Participants underwent audiological, behavioral, and EEG assessments at two timepoints, spaced approximately 2 years apart. The study used a dichotic listening task, where participants listened to two competing sentences and responded to the final noun of one. EEG was recorded during the task, and neural filtering was calculated as the difference between attended and ignored speech tracking. Behavioral performance was measured by accuracy and response time. The study found that neural filtering was stable over time, with a reliability of r = 0.6 when tracking attended speech alone. However, when tracking both attended and ignored speech, filtering was less reliable, with a reliability of r = 0.3. The study also found that neural filtering was linked to behavioral performance, with stronger filtering associated with faster and more accurate responses. A mediation analysis showed that age and hearing loss mediated the relationship between filtering and behavior. Longitudinal analysis showed that filtering did not predict behavioral change, but age and hearing loss did. Structural equation modeling showed that baseline neural filtering predicted 2-year change in behavior, but not vice versa. The study concluded that neural filtering is a readout of attentional state, but not a predictor of behavioral change.
A study investigated the relationship between the perception of taste and flavor (chemosensation) and the therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient Greece and Rome. The researchers analyzed 700 botanicals described in Dioscorides' De Materia Medica, a pharmaceutical compendium from the 1st century CE, and used a trained panel to assess the chemosens qualities of each drug. They found that chemensation was strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with drugs with high versatility having simple tastes and intense flavors, and 22 chemens qualities predicting at least one therapeutic use. The study also found that bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy flavors were associated with versatility. The researchers propose that chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemest and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of uses of botanicals in ancient times. They used phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models to test the relationship between chemens qualities, intensity, and complexity and therapeutic uses, accounting for confounding effects of shared chemens stimuli by related species. The study found a positive relationship between intense chemensation and versatility, consistent with a causal link between strong sensations and effects. The researchers also detected nuances in significance and absence of relationships between individual uses and magnitudes. The study highlights the potential of chemens pharmacology in the development of herbal medicines and suggests that chemens perception connects ancient knowledge with modern, even though etiologies were different in ancient times. The study offers a blueprint for revaluation of pre-scient knowledge and points to a role for taste and flavor in medicine.
Bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of sepsis-related deaths in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Despite the connection between Enterobacteraceae-induced sepsis and GI bleeding, it remained unknown whether these bacteria perceive serum through chemosensing. Serum is a biological solution with components that may enhance or inhibit bacterial growth, offering a rich source of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and metals. However, it also contains host factors that inhibit proliferation in the bloodstream, such as cathelicin, defensins, and the complement. To address this question, researchers elucidated how Enterobacter species use chemensing to respond to serum, the mechanism of this response, and chemensing employed to enter and migrate into hemorrhagic lesions. Across examined scenarios, bacteria exhibited sensitivity and attraction to human serum, suggesting environmental stimuli unique to the dysotic gut sensed through bacterial chemosystems can encourage pathogenic behaviors and consequences for the host. To model enter bleeding in vitro, an experimental system was used to inject minute human serum into a pond of motile bacteria and observe real-time responses by microscopy. The system, referred to as CIRA, offers advantages for studying chemensing and localization in response to serum: (1) uses bonaide human serum, (2) readouts are direct measurements of real-time dynamics of the population, and (3) similar to bleeding, a source of serum is continuously emitted. Employing multich fluorescence of differentially labeled populations, observed polymicrobial interactions through head-to-head comparisons of behavior within the same experiment. CIRA established a microgradient through injection at constant rate ~300/min through 0.5 µm glass capillary and expands over time. Diffusion of serum metabolites can be approximated by three-dimensional diffusion equation. Introduction of a minute of effector produces a micro, which millolar recedes to nanolar across a few hundred. For instance, in assay, a bacter 100 µm from 1 mM-volume experience a local of 10M after 300 s injection. To visualize the microgradient, Alexa Fluor 488 was used and the micro was stable and consistent across replicates. As test of accuracy, calculated values A488 to normalized intensity at 120 s and determined to be within 5 over distance 70-270 µ. At distances <70 µ, measured is 10% lower than predicted. No differences in treatments with buffer in pH 4-9, indicating small localized changes inconsequential for taxis in system and artactual, such as flow, account for minor changes at population level ±10. Studied chemos behaviors of S. Typhimium IR, a derivative of ATCC 28 isolated from domestic chickens, and used in study Salmon pathogenesis. Utilized commercially available human that was not-inactivated nor exposed to chemical or physical treatments that alter native properties. Assessed response of motile IR containing m marker to source human over 5 min. During timeframe, witnessed rapid response whereby population reorganized from random to concentrated within 100-150 µ radius of serum. Compared responses between C experiments plotted as relative bacteria within 150 µ of treatment or radial distribution over time. By metrics, determined S Tyimium is attracted to human. Population proximity to serum doubles by s, reaches maximal rate by 90, and equilibrium by 300 post-treatment. Tested serum attraction in Salmon strains that infect humans and responses among non-tyoidal serovars. All showed attraction to serum, with some peak 50-75 µ from source, possibly due to compromise between proximity to nutrients in serum and avoidance bacteridal elements. Overall, data show S enter serars cause disease in humans exquisitely sensitive to human, responding femiter as attractant and distinct organization at population within minutes exposure. Serum is complex solution contains sugars, amino, and metabolites that serve attract
The study identifies a conserved male germ cell expression program spanning over 600 million years of evolution, which provides insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. The average functional requirement of a metazoan male cell is estimated to be approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with the majority being conserved. Despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and frequent birthplace of genetic novelty, conserved genes are central to the male cell transcriptome, with younger genes preferentially expressed in spermatogenesis. 79 interactions between 104 transcription regulators define a core of the conserved program of sperogenesis. Functionally interfering with conserved genes associated with germ identity reveals 161 unknown sperogenesis and 3 potential causes of human infertility. The transcription identity of metazo male cells is built around a small network of conserved interactions with an overarching impact. This provides a unifying basis for the conservation of fundamental cell processes such as sperm motility and gamete fusion. A conserved interactions are present in species with divergent germ segregation strategies, indicating an ancestral multipot program in precursor cells. The study uses comparative biology to identify new causes of human disease, focusing on the evolutionary past of spermatogenesis. A pipeline is repurposed for other cell and pathologies, available as an open resource. Human, mouse, and fruit RNA-Seq data of spermat stages and embryonic layers were downloaded and checked for quality, preprocessed, and quantified. Orthogroups were defined based on proteomes of 25 species, and assembled using OrthFinder. Phylostrata were assigned to each orthog by the oldest clade, and genes were mapped to phyloata 1-5. The transcriptome was allocated to phyloata 1-5, and compared between germ and soma using Mann-Whitney test. Transcript age was calculated as the product of TPM and node. Spermatocyte P networks were assembled from human, mouse, and fruit data, and edges were retrieved from STRING. The metric was used to define the backbone of each layer, and ortholog connections were established. The orthoBack was a shared subgraph of the metric of all layers, with edges connecting orthologs. Annotations from Gene Ontology were used to select humanoBack edges connecting spermat-related genes. 79 interactions defined a core of cons program sperogenesis. The size of orthBack was calculated for two species, with 19,333 edges in human and 9,285 in fruit. Reads were aligned to genomes, and gene counts were obtained, normalized, and differential expression was performed. Genes were defined as upregulated at meiotic and downregulated post-meiotic. 920 genes were conserved in both species, with 797 in humans and 850 in mice. UAS-GAL was used to silence genes at mitosis-me transition, and fertility was assessed. Gene-sil males were mated with wildtype females, and fertility was evaluated. Phenotypes were assigned to silenced genes, and meiotic area was quantified. dNF was immunofluorescence was performed on testes, and intensity was measured. A mutant Rnf2 was generated, and homozygous mice were euthanized, and fertility evaluated. RNA was extracted from test, and expression was determined. WES was performed on 1,021 azosperm men, and Lo variants were filtered, and inheritance was predicted. Heterozyg variants were identified in H2 and KP2, and inheritance was predicted as autosomal dominant. Variants in vicinity of R were queried, and none were associated with infertility. Segregation was performed on DN1, and was not pathogenic. No chromosomal aberrations or microdeletions were identified.
This study investigates the coordination of flagellar beating in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a flagellate organism that employs synchronous, breast-like flagellar beating to swim and modulate beating amplitudes differentially to steer. The organism's strategy hinges on flagellar asymmetries, such as different responses to chemical messengers and asymmetries being effectively coordinated in synchronous beating. The study aims to elucidate the roles of each flagell in synchronous beating using experiments, computations, and modeling. A non-invasive technique is developed to selectively load each flagell, showing that coordinated beating only responds to loads exerted on cisell and asymmetry derives from unilateral between flagella. Results highlight distinct roles for each flag in coordination and implications for biflagellates' tactic behaviors. The flagella of C. reinii have inherently different dynamic properties, such as frequency, waveform, level of active noise, and responses to mess. Intriguingly, when connected by basal fibers and beating synchronously, they adopt kinematics of cis-eyes flagum, leading to assumption that flag may have differential in coordination. This study tests hypothesis by oscillatory flows applied from angle respect cells' axis, exerting loads oneell. Experiments with wt cells robustly observe cisows, selectively loading cisell, are more effective entraining flagellar than transows. Observations indicate cisloads determine external can entrain cell. Unexpectedly, when transows applied, transell always beats against flow and only stabilizing factor flowentr is cisell working with flow during recovery. Observations definitively prove flag have differential in coordination and imply coupled external only through cis. A stochastic model is developed to elucidate mechanisms of asymmetry, representing hydro loading and flag dominance in coordinated by ϵ≠ϵ and λ≠λ. Monte-Carlo simulations clarify interplay between flows and flag and reproduce experimental observations, showing 'dominance of cis (λ≫tc) is sufficient to explain comprehensively. This dominance means cis-phase is less sensitive trans-phase than other way. Phase of flowentrainment is reproduced varying detings, amplitudes, and noises. Lower limit of basal coupling λ+λ is approximately 40 Hz, an order larger than hydro-flag coupling. Modulation flag dominance synchronous is basis C. reinhardt's motility, calcium speculated to facilitate dynamic, involved in switching beating and tuning flag amplitude. Study investigates flag coupling in context tactic by depleting environmental calcium and inhibiting signals. Cells acimated to depletion, tested directional flows show cis dominance does not require environmental calcium. Depletion induces overall drop in forcing perceived by cell, captured reducing ϵ+ϵ. In contrast, speculation calcium involved dynamic modulation ciliary (Rü andult, 1997; Wan et al,201; Guo et,202), results indicate leading cis is inherent, possibly mechanical asymmetry cellular anchors flag into body. p1 cells lack flag dominance λ=λ and stronger noise necessary reproduce observations. Studies suggested both flag p1 similar wt and noise levels synchronous greater wt (Leos et,201). If flag and anchoring have composition wt, symmetry predict λ=tc. This coupling leads noise p1≈t, an order larger wt≈c. Comparison highlights advantage unilateral (ct≫tc) strongly suppresses high trans noise, allowing benefit stable cis driver and noisy sensor.
Intermittent fasting has been shown to have various health benefits, including delaying aging, improving metabolism, and enhancing cognition. However, the mechanism underlying metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Recent studies have suggested that beigeing of white adipose tissue, which accounts for major energy expenditure, is involved in the metabolic benefits of intermittent. Beigeing of whiteose tissue is induced by stimulation of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 polarization, but the role of immune cells in this process is unclear. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of immune cells lacking antigen receptors on T and B cells. ILCs are divided into five groups: natural cells, type 1 ILCs, type 2 ILCs, type 3 ILCs (ILCs), and lymphoid-inducing cells. Type 1 ILCs promote adipose fibrosis and obesity-associated insulin resistance, while type 2 ILC promote beige of whiteose and limit obesity. However, the contribution of ILCs to obesity is less clear. ILCs produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-22 (IL-22) in response to extracellular and fungi. ILC-derived IL-22 enhances intestinal barrier, reduces endotoemia, ameliorates insulin sensitivity, and improves metabolic disorder polycystic ovary syndrome. ILCs are also involved in induction of obesity, contributing to metabolic disease. The role of ILCs in disease is complex, and the role of ILCs in intermittent and beige of whiteose is unknown. This study reported that alternate fasting promoted secretion of IL-22 by ILCs. Adoptive transfer of ILCs increased beige of whiteose in diet-induced obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 induced beige of whiteose. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated beige of whiteose induced by intermittent. The study established the role of ILC-IL-22-IL-22 axis in beige of whiteose. ILCs are critical for beige of whiteose induced by intermittent. The mechanism underlying secretion of IL-22 by ILCs is unknown. The study revealed distinct pattern of IL-22 induced intermittent. VIP signaling may coordinate with food to drive production of IL-22. ILCs interact with DCs and macroages in intestine, influencing IL-22 production. The study suggests intermittent can promote secretion of IL-22 by ILCs. IL-22 promotes beige of whiteose through IL-22. ILCs may be a target for intervention of metabolic disorders.
This study investigated the contributions of associative and non-associative processes to the expression of cue-induced defensive behaviors in mice. The results showed that pairings of a proximal stimulus association during fear conditioning produce maximal expression of cue-induced freezing and flight responses. Non-associative elements such as salience, change in stimulus intensity, and shock-induced sensitization elicited stress behaviors like tail-rattling and activity. Associative and non-associative factors combine to produce distinct transitions between freezing and flight. During conditioning, distinct ethograms were observed for the paired and unpaired groups in response to the compound stimulus. Freezing to tone and activity were higher in the paired group compared to the unpaired, highlighting the impact of stimulus-shock contingency on magnitude responses. The paired and paired-reversed groups showed significant increases in freezing from pre-stimulus to tone, while the unpaired and un-reversed groups freezing tone was greater than contextual, suggesting the paired groups placed associative value on the tone. The paired group displayed more intense behavior during WN than the paired-reversed, indicating the proximity of WN to footock threat affects defensive scaling. Jumping and darting behaviors were examined, and the paired exhibited consistent responses to WN during conditioning not reproduced in unpaired and un-reversed groups. Darting was found to be an associative response to imminent threat, not due to non-associ salience of WN. Tail-ratt was observed in unpaired and unversed groups, but not paired and paired-reversed, indicating a nonassociative response to uncertain threat. During extinction, paired and paired-reversed showed highest tone-evoked freezing compared to nonassociative groups, indicating strongest association between tone and threat. Tone-ev freezing in paired underwent extinction, while paired-reversed was resistant, likely due to temporal proximity of cue to footock. WN-ev flight in paired was associative and dependent on perceived threat value of WN. Jumping to WN in paired was associative and extinguished, making a measure for future studies.
Insects navigate their environment by keeping track of their orientation, which is achieved by integrating visual cues and angular signals over time to maintain a heading relative angle. Previous studies have shown that neural encoding of head direction in insects has a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear if this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or offers a functional advantage. To address this question, the authors establish the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits with different patterns. Among these patterns, they prove that sinusoidal is the most noise-resilant, but only when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. They compare the predicted connectivity with anatomical data from locust and fruit fly, finding agreement with experimental evidence. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the insect's genetic program but can develop during development. The authors show that the presence of eight-column organization in head circuits across multiple species is not a coincidence but can be explained by basic principles. Insects exhibit impressive navigation abilities, traveling long distances to migrate, find food, or reach places before returning to nests, which requires keeping track of orientation across journeys. Orientation is achieved by visual cues and integrating angular signals over time to maintain a heading relative angle. Electrophysiological and imaging studies have shown neural encoding head in insects has sinus-shaped activity. Theoretical work speculated that recurring sinusoidal patterns might be prevalent because it enables element-wise vector addition, where encoded sinusoidal waveforms can be added to give a sinusoidal sum of vectors. This allows the heading to be used by downstream circuitry to track the insect's position. Studies have shown models aligned with biological can implement heading using sinusoidal patterns and circuits can be learned. However, the authors show that easy vector addition cannot be the unique factor for sinusoidal encoding, as many circuits with different patterns can perform vector addition. To address this, they consider the basic requirements for a circuit to encode direction and find that sinusoidal offers the best resilience to noise. This requires a specific connectivity pattern between neurons. They predict that the integration circuit will have sinusoidal connectivity. The authors compare the predicted circuit with data from locust and fly, finding agreement. They demonstrate the circuit can emerge using Hebb plasticity. The presence of eight organization in head circuits is not a coincidence but can be explained by basic principles.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimer mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a major target of Park-mediated ubiquitination. We discovered a heightened propensity of CIS1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PINK patients. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide. In this conformation, CIS1 cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CIS, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and mutant CIS incapable of binding the ironulf cluster in Drosila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. Complete loss of CIS rescued detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing, wing, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest CIS1, iron-depleted CIS, operates downstream of Pink1, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as a therapeutic target. PD is the fastest neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by rigor, bradykines, and tremor. Most cases are sporadic, but familial forms are linked to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial control like PINK and Park. PINK is continuously imported into mitochondria, where it is degraded. In unfitria with reduced membrane potential, PINK stalls, phosphorylates proteins, including E ubiquitinase Park. Phosphorylation activates Park, enabling to attach ubiquitin to mitochondrial proteins. Ubiquination signals damagedria to be engulfed by autophag, initiating degradation. This elimination safeguards mitochondrial health and function. Much mechanistic understanding has been elucidated in Dophila where Pink and Park loss result in profound mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired flight, and shortened lifespan. In addition to disturbances in quality, iron contribute to pathogenesis. PD patients exhibit iron in substantia, and accumulation correlates with disease severity. Notably, this dysregulation is apparent in asymptomatic carriers of Park mutations. Furthermore, dopamin neurons lacking PINK display inhibition of iron-dependent mitochondrial aconase, leading to accumulation N+ and depletion of metabolites. Flies Pink deficiency results inactivation aconase by impairing labile ironulf cluster, to oxidative distress and swelling. These findings highlight relevance of ironreg in development and progression. CIS1, a target of PINK/Park, is crucial for iron and redox homeostasis. CIS forms a complex with Park, and interaction is increased by P activation and ubiquination. Dila homolog CIS1 is strongly ubiquinated in response to Park overexpression in vivo. CIS exists as homimer, each monomer harboring 2/2 ironulf cluster coordinated by cystines and histidine. In contrast, most 2/2 clusters are coordinated by cystines or cystines and histidines. This peculiarity makes CIS 2/2 cluster susceptible to oxidation. CIS can transfer theulf cluster to stress-sensitive proteins, helping recovery from injury. CIS can recycle cytos apo-IR1 to holoconase donating 2/2 cluster. The remaining CIS is unknown. CIS is involved in bioenergetics and morphology regulation. Card myocytes lacking CIS exhibit reduced oxidative capacity, akin to MEFs with reduced total volume. Dila ortholog CIS, C2, is located ER and overexpression detrimental in muscles, forming double-membr vesicles containing cytoplasmic proteins. CIS2 interacts with IR1, further linking to iron homeasis. Our study investigated CIS role in PD using Dila and mammalian systems. We identified CIS, particularly ironpleted, as mediator of pathophys effects from Pink and Park loss. CIS in dopamin neurons
This study investigated the role of the Aster yellows phytoplas effector SAP54 in attracting leafhoppers, the primary vectors of A-W phytoplas, to produce progeny on plants exposed to leafh males. The researchers found that female preference for SAP plants only occurs in the presence of males, and both SAP and males are necessary for this preference, as females did not show preference in their absence. SAP plants exposed to males display significant downregulation of biotic responses. The MADS transcription factor SVP was identified as essential for female preference of male-exposed SAP plants. Leafopper exhibited preference for reproducing on sv null plants, contingent on presence of leafh males, aligning with observation that SAP mediates degradation of S. Characterizing a parasite effector revealed crucial role of S in susceptibility to herborous insects, enhancing attraction and colonization. This built on previous findings that leaf flowers not required for insect preference and vectors predominantly attracted to leaves. Morphological change in host may not responsible for extended effect on alternative host, which in this case insect. Attraction of vectors to leaves primary function of SAP, induction of leaf flowers evolutionary-effect of SAP adaptation to MTF leading to degradation S. Prevention of seed production through formation likely present advantage to phytopma. A-W phylas commonly infect annuals, naturally senes and off after flowering and seed production. Prolonging longevity hosts advantageous for phy, considering not seed-transmitted, rely leafoppers feed veget tissues for transmission. SAP mediates destabilization S, but no direct interaction found between SAP and S in YH analyses. MTF exhibit diverse complexes, including homo and hetero-dimers, ternary and quatern. SVP interacts other MTF SOC, SOC, F, and A24, and SAP interacts and facilitates degradation SOC, F, and A24. S recognized conserved regulator flowering, expressed in leaves during vegetative stages, correlates with wide range A-W phy. Primary role S and homs associated flowering, involvement additional processes underexplored. Emerging research shed light on roles S outside flowering, acts positive age resistance against bacterial in Arabid thalian, negative regulator various Jasate Z-domain J during vegetative phase.

Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to health and has a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration. To characterize this tolerance at the single-cell level, a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform was used to profile thousands of fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antif drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage, distinct and metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations: one characterized by upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal, rRNA machinery, and cellular respiration, termed R-domin (Rd) state, and the other for genes stress and related processes, termed Stressomin (S) state. This bifcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. The ribosome stress response (RR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate survival. Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent fungal pathogens, with systemic infections causing 15-20% mortality in premature infants and 30-50% nosocomial bloodstream infections. The frequency of resistance is lower than treatment failures, with most susceptible to drug. Clinical persistence results from heterogeneity in drug responses, host status, and inability to reach fungal sites. A fungal can thrive in antif drug concentrations exceeding minimum inhibitory (MIC) with detectable within 24 hr exposure. A tolerant isolate has 5-95% cells grow, albeit slowly, at concentrations surpassing population MIC. Tolerance is detectable 48 hr after drug, longer than clinical assays. Approaches predicting response based solely on average cells can overlook subpopulations with potential impact evolution resistance. Resistance results from mutations influencing drug interaction with target, while tolerance from phenotypic heterogeneity or cell-cell variations. Microbial heterogeneity confers benefits like bet-hed, metabolic shifts, division, and resource sharing. Antifungal tolerance differs from antibacterial, defined by proportion growth supra-MIC drug relative growth without drug. In C. alb, tolerance characterized by proportion growth fluconazole (FCZ). The underlying and implications differ from bacterial resistance, small subpopulation exhibits bactericidal drugs. This study focuses on antif tolerance FCZ, a fungatic drug. Previous studies characterized aspects of tolerance in C. alb. Tolerance largely drug-independent and correlates poor outcomes. Tolerance increases population size and emergence cannot attributed accumulation adaptive mutations, as tolerant and original give rise mixed tolerant and non-tolerant similar proportions. Adjuvant used alongside FC prevent evolution because modulate tolerance by targeting H90, calcinein, TOR, PK, and sphingip biosynthesis. Molecular coordinating tolerance regulation across pathways not fully understood, stress appear central. Several processes essential, ergol biosynthesis and proteome reviewed. Most studies tolerance, from classic assays to omics, treated subpopulations as homogeneous due lack technology. Single-cell (sc) transcript assays applied mammalian, but limited fungal due rigid cell, wall, membrane, and RNA per cell. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, limited microfluid orcoding examined ~100 cells, and high-throughput transcriptome ~40K cells. This study profiles C. alb using fungalol droplet (DROPq) modified from Macko et al, 2015, overcame technical challenges, cost-effective solution. Profiles thousands individual cells enriched understanding community and heterogeneity. This refines bulk studies differentiating genes, pathways, responses universally expressed, and specific subpopulations. Examining trajectories populations high-throughput obtained insights time-sensitive processes, emergence tolerance 2-3 drug exposure, Rd and S states, reflecting RAST response molecular S cerevisae stress.
The article proposes a new metric, Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), to measure the effectiveness of selection in species, which is based on the Kull-Leibler divergence of observed codon frequencies from expected frequencies given genomic GC content. This metric corrects for confounding factors such as GC content and amino acid composition, unlike previous metrics like Cod Adaptation Index (CAI) and Effective Number of Codons (ENC). CAIS is calculated from a single genome without requiring polymorphism or mutation data, tRNA copy numbers, or abundances. The authors demonstrate CAIS correlation with intrinsic disorder (IS) in proteins, which is more abundant in eukaryotic than proary proteins, and show that exquisely adapted species have more disordered domains. Controlling for Pfam identity, a random effect, the fixed species effect on IS is correlated with CA and ENC. The correlation is stronger with CA, which controls amino frequencies, than ENC, which only controls GC content. A version of CA with local GC expectations based on intergenic content performed worse. The authors suggest genome-wide GC serves as a time-avered proxy for local GC-based conversion. Young animal-specific domains have higher IS, possibly due to selection favoring primitive methods to avoid aggregation. The study uses a linear model controlling Pfam as a random effect to show the same domain tends to be disordered in well-adapted species. The authors define CA as the Kull-Le divergence from cod usage given GC content, excluding forces like mutation, GCased conversion, and selection on nucleotide substitutions favoring GC. Controlling GC, CA and ENC are not correlated with GC, but CAI is. The new metric controls amino frequencies, unlike ENC only GC.
This study investigates the role of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an imbalanced host response to infection. The authors demonstrate that seps-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) releasing the highest amount. They show that ATP release is dependent on the respiratory chain at the bacterial inner membrane, specifically ATP synthase, and not cytochrome3 oxidase. Mutations in ATPase subunits lead to lower ATP release, while mutations in cyto3 oxidase subunits can be compensated by other subunits. Instability of the outer membrane, as seen in the ΔF mutant, is associated with bacterial death and ATP release. The study also shows that ATP is released via outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which contain ATP and distribute throughout the body to activate cells, such as neutils, initiating inflammatory responses. Delivery of ATP by OM results in upregulation of lysosomal and neutil degran pathways, increasing seps severity. The findings have potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for seps, such as in vitro OM that modulate neutil function via intracellular purergic receptors during seps.
This study investigated the relationship between genetic and environmental factors on the development of intelligence and psychotic-like experiences (LE) in youth, leveraging data from large epidemiological samples and multi-level socioeconomic data. The results support the model that genetic factors (polygenic scores for cognitive phenotypes), socioeconomic conditions, and family and school environments influence intelligence in children, which may lead to variability in current and future LE in children. The analysis integrated data shows contributions of genetic and environmental factors to cognitive and mental wellness in children, providing policy implications to improve them. The structural equation model shows intelligence mediates environmental and genetic on current and future LE. Environmental factors (family, neighborhood, SES, and positive and schooling) and polygenic scores exhibit indirect effects via intelligence on LE. The study advances by demonstrating integrated effects of genetic and environmental on LE through intelligence in 9-11-year-old children, contributing to assessing relative importance of factors influencing children's cognition and mental health, aiding future studies for health implications. The magnitudes of effects, though effects poly scores remain significant, aggregated environmental factors account for greater on LE. Intelligence mediates genetic and environmental on LE may be related to mechanisms, such as children in higher SES have nutrition and stimulants, living in deprived exposed to crime, air, pollution, and substance.

This study aimed to investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) in human brain development using a 3D organoids. The authors developed a novel protocol combining 2D neural induction with 3D culture in spinning biore to generate reproducible brain-like cellular architectures, including roset and neural epithelia, which matured into organized cortical-like structures. They found distinct types of human neural progenitors, including outer radial glial cells and apical truncated cells, which were promoted by dual SMAD inhibition and W inhibition. FGF treatment was added at day 10 to preserve FOX1 expression and telenceph identity while modulating F8 target genes such as NR1. F8-treated organoids showed ventral telph genes and reduced dorsal genes like EM1, NEURO2, SO5, and HX. Functional assays using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) revealed reduced network activity and signal propagation in F8-treated organoids compared to controls, aligning with reduced excitatory glutamateric and increased inhibitory GABA neurons. Immunostaining and single-cell sequencing confirmed these findings, with increased GABAergic neurons and reduced glutamateric neurons in F8 organoids. The study highlights F8 role in regional patterning and modulating developmental genes, including NDD-related targets like NR1.
This study investigates the development of circadian rhythms in Drosila larvae, focusing on the role of nutritional status in regulating sleep-wake patterns. Researchers found that in the 2nd instar stage, sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar stage. Forcing mature 3rd instar animals to adopt immature 2nd stage feeding strategies disrupts sleepake rhythms and long-term memory (LTM). The development of the clock circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Larval arousal neurons (Dh44) act through glucose genes to drive the onset of daily-wake rhythms. Data suggest that changes in energetic demands trigger the formation of sleep-cadian circuits and behaviors. Disruptions in circadian rhythms during early life have negative impacts on adult behaviors, neuronal morphology, and physiology. In humans, disruptions in sleep rhythms during development are common in neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD and autism. Mechanisms encoding the clock are well understood, but little is known about rhythmic behaviors emergence. Cues that trigger the consolidation of sleep and waking as development are unclear. A potential factor in maturation of sleep patterns is the coincident change in feeding and metabolism during development. Early development, young must obtain nutrients for proper growth, but also sleep to support nervous system development. Conflicting needs result in rapid transitions between sleeping and feeding states. As development proceeds, intake and storage increase, allowing consolidation of feeding and sleep to specific times. Changes in storage are conserved in mammalian body composition and capacity over development. Drosila show rapid increases in larval body size, including fat storage across development. The role of metabolic change in regulating consolidation is not known. Adult Dila sleep and feeding are consolidated to specific times, with eating more during the day than night. Early development, in 2 inst Dila larvae lack circadian pattern. Researchers previously determined sleepake are initiated in 3 instila (72 AEL). DN neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh arousal neurons to drive consolidation. Development of this circuit promotes sleep and emergence of LTM at L but not before. This study identifies cues that trigger the emergence of Dh-Dh circuit and consolidation sleepake in Dila. Developmental changes in energetic drive consolidation periods of sleep and feeding across the day as animals mature. Endogenous sleep in L facilitates LTM, but inducing sleep in L2 is detrimental and does not improve L performance. The Dh circuit is developmentally plastic, as rearing on insufficient environment prevents establishment. Dh neurons require glucose genes to promote sleepake development.
Researchers studied the energetic benefits of schooling in fish by measuring both aerobic and anaerobic energy use in giant danio (Deioequipatus) swimming at various speeds. They used a swim-tunnel respi to measure oxygen consumption (O2) and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EC) after swimming. The results showed that schools have a concave-shaped metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum cost at 1.25 body lengths per second (BL-1), and a 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% lower anaerobic energy compared to solitary fish. Schools used 38% of their aerobic capacity, while solitary used 55%. The total energy expenditure (EE) of schools was 38-53% lower than solitary at 5-8 BL-1, with anaerobic energy accounting for 29-58% of EE in schools and 62-81% in solitary. The cost of transport (COT) of schools was 43% lower than solitary at 5-8 BL-1. Schools also recovered faster from exercise, with a 43% lower EC and 43% faster recovery time compared to solitary. The study suggests that schooling reduces energy costs and improves performance, allowing fish to allocate more energy to other activities like growth and reproduction.

This study investigated the metabolic and functional plasticity of human macrophages, specifically airway macrophages (AM) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) priming. Human AM and M were primed with IF-γ or IL-4 for 24 hours and then stimulated with irradiated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37v) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results showed that IF-γ increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in both AM and M, while IL-4 reduced glycol in AM. IF-γ primed AM exhibited increased expression of HLA-DR, CD40, and CD86, while IL-4 primed AM showed reduced expression of these markers. The study also found that IF-γ primed AM produced more IL-1β, TN, and IL-10 in response to H37v and L, while IL-4 primed AM produced less IL-10. Inhibiting glycol with 2-deglucose (DG) reduced IL-1, TN, and IL-10 production in IF-primed AM and M. The study suggests that IF-γ promotes cytokine production in AM via glycolysis. The results indicate that AM have functional plasticity in cytokine production response to IFγ, while M are more phenotypically plastic.
Researchers have demonstrated for the first time that nocturnal ants use the polarized pattern produced by the moon for navigation. Nocturnal ants, such as Myrmia pyiform and Myrmia mid, have been shown to use solar-polar light during twilight periods, but also navigate after twilight when polar cues are absent. True nocturnal navigation in these ants could be driven by the moon's presence, with M. pyiform showing more foraging on full nights. M. mid exhibits high overnight activity, with half of foragers returning before morning twilight. M. mid navigates heavily canied forest, where the moon is occluded, but polar pattern remains unstruct. The study characterised lunar and solarised detection in M. mid, comparing solar and moon polar navigation in homing to the nest. Similarities occur when comparing solar and moon polar navigation in ants. Inbound foragers tested during twilight, altered paths under filter almost full 45 solar-vector manipulation, but compensated half when 1-2 m from nest. Foragers near shifts 5 m from nest exhibited full shifts, and 2 m from nest half shifts. Observations suggest updates are not immediate, occurring after ant travels original heading few centimetres. Foragers use available celestial and terrestrial cues, weighting polar pattern changes with vector and state, not location. Ants weight polar cue highly, perform larger shifts when path distance longer. Increased magnitudes align with longer vectors increase weighting cue. Ants use polar moon same as solar, polar moon integrated into pathator throughout night. Polar moon is processed same pathways as polar sunlight, same neural architecture. Limiting lunar use factors are detection threshold, intensity, sensitivity, or spectral. Foragers detect polar moon when homing across lunar, even wax crescent nights. Lack shift reduction between full and crescent suggests no reduction. No shift with moon indicates navigators do not fall on memories. Unexpected reduction in shift under waning relative wax. Waning foragers showed evidence attending polar, but magnitudes smaller waxing. Reduction suggests polar moon detected weakly weighted, due incorporation into pathator interrupted. Periods overnight moon absent, degrades compass portion estimate. Ants tracking lunar compass by time-compens or reference other cues, such as panorama. It is possible lunar eemer function or compensates moon position. Study cannot untangle, ants had view sky and panorama throughout night. Reductions suggest foragers need period exposure moon pattern employ fully inbound. Future tackle lunar e function exposing or blocking access sky, familiar periods moon visible. Inbound M. mid foragers detect and respond to rotations, reorient ambient after exit. Ability across lunar, polar moon detect cue throughout month. Heading due polar align responses solar part pathator. Indicates polar moon integrated same pathways sunlight. Reduction shifts differences vector, periods access polar pattern suggest weight information. Foragers cater decisions proportionally match reliability.
Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) imaging to investigate the structure and properties of the tail vanes of early pterosaurs, specifically Rhamorhynchus, from the Upper Jurassic Solnhenimestones. Over 100 Solnhen posaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tailves using ultraviolet, and four exceptional specimens were imaged under LSF. Three specimens exhibited vanes under light, while one was only visible under LSF. LSF confirmed the soft tissue of the vanes and revealed anatomical details. The vanes were subymmetrical and diamond-shaped, with a length of 700-750 mm, occupying 21-23% of the total tail length of 320-362 mm. The vanes were widest at two-thirds along its length, with a width of 41-55 mm. The vanes formed anterior and posterior angles of 40-90°, with no change in caud morphology outside the periphery. The van encompassed least 15-17 caals, with 13-14 bearing elongated zgapyses. The van originated from the anterior of caal, with LSF edges visible along with 17 structures projecting vertically perpendicular to the skeleton. These structures were relatively thick, hollow, rod-like, and arranged 3-8 mm apart, forming a cross-linked lattice. The outer margin of the van was undulated, with a trough 0.7 mm deep where structures met the margin and a convex mid-way between pairs. A second layer of thinner fibres ran across the structures, parallel to the tail axis, becoming more spaced as they reached the tip.
Adolescence is a transitional period characterized by changes in behaviors, such as increased risk-taking, sensation-seeking, and peer-focused sociality, which are thought to be evolutionarily advantageous for transition to independence. However, it is also a time of increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, schizophrenia, and affective disorders that persist into adulthood. Understanding the adolescent brain's normative state may help pinpoint why systems are perturbed in disease. Reorganization of the dopamine system is hypothesized to underlie many adolescent changes, particularly reward-related learning and decision-making, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. The dopamine system undergoes major changes in adolescence, including increased receptor density, neuronal sensitivity, and altered dynamics compared to adults. The goal of this study was to identify variations in nucleus accumbens (Nac) stimulated dopamine release and pinpoint mechanisms driving these changes in adolescent and adult male rats. Consistent with previous findings, no difference in dopamine uptake (Vmax) was found between adult and adolescent rats. Stimulation parameters were adjusted to model tonic and phasic neuronal firing across frequencies to mimic physiologically relevant patterns. Replicating previous findings, decreased dopamine release was found in the NAc of adolescent rats. This is consistent with in vivo evidence of male rats demonstrating lower NAc release than adults. The decrease is driven by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine in adolescent rats through acetylcholine acting α-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh) and GABA. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence, and changes are implicated in behavior and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. This study gives insight into age differences in dopamine and regulation, highlighting neurochemical targets that may underlie behavioral changes. Examining these systems in healthy individuals is crucial for understanding how perturbations disrupt development and lead disease.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, and the presence of repetitive and restrictive behaviors. Despite common impairments defining ASD, there is heterogeneity in clinical and etiological underpinnings among individuals. This heterogeneity raises the possibility of different ASD subtypes. Studies have compared multiple ASD subtypes to investigate commonalities. About 10-15% of autism cases are genetically defined by single mutations or copy variants, while most etiology remains undefined or idiopathic. Much knowledge of ASD pathophysiology is derived from rodent studies of syndromic variant genes, limiting insight into majority of pathophysiology. Several studies uncovered convergence of rare and common ASD genes onto developing mid-fetal cerebral cortex (8-24 weeks). During this period, neural cells undergo proliferation, migration, and differentiation to form normal brain architecture. Induced pluripotent stem (iPSC) technology allows studying human development in cells from individuals with genetic and idiopathic psychiatric disorders. iSC of monogenic CN, CN, and idi ASD observed alterations basic processes, such as synapse formation. However, few studies focused on developmental events preceding synapse, like neurite out and cell migration. Alterations have been reported in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) like schizophrenia, Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Timothy syndrome, and CN2 mutation. This study found common neurite and migration impairments in two ASD subtypes, idiopathic (IAS) and genetically defined 16.11.2 deletion (16Del). iSC-derived NPCs from IAS and 16Del had reduced neurite out and migration compared to sex-matched siblings (S). Both subtypes had impaired neur out and migration, despite genetic heterogeneity. pte and western studies identified mTOR signaling as a point of convergence for shared neur and migration phenotypes. Unbiased pte analysis uncovered differences between IAS and 16Del, despite non-overlapping genetics. mTOR pathway was enriched in both subtypes. Gain and loss function studies showed mTOR drives neurodevelopmental defects. Characterizing ASD by m levels could identify candidates for m activators or inhibitors in future trials. IAS individuals failed to respond to extracellular factors (EF), while 16Del had typical increases in neur and migration under EF stimulation. Difference in response did not correlate with m defects. Understanding subtypes may help tailor treatments for ASD and comorbid conditions. This study found convergence neurodevelopment and molecular phenotypes in distinct subtypes using rigorous methods, including multiple iSC clones and inductions. Extensive analyses included 29 clones and 61 inductions, relatively small sample size. Sample had clinical and genotypic heterogeneity, yet common phenotypes were uncovered. Expanding study to subtypes or NDD would establish common mechanisms.
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural diversity in the auditory system, specifically in the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea. The researchers used paired recordings of IHC and SGN boutons in ex vivo to mimic in vivo conditions and found that high synapses had larger and more compact excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower thresholds, shorter latencies, and higher release rates compared to low synapses. High synapses were predominantly located on the pillar side of IHC. The study suggests that synaptic heterogeneity contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. Synaptic diversity is expressed across the nervous system, within a circuit, and even within a neuron, and occurs at various levels, including synapse shape, size, ultrastructure, and molecular composition. The auditory system harbors examples of diversity, such as glutamaterg synapses in the cochlea, calce synapses in the brainstem, and bout synapses in the central system. Heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual IHC with multiple SGNs, even at different tonotopic positions of the cochlea. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found to be a mechanism for the cochlea to decompose acoustic information, breaking sound intensity into complementary rate codes of SGNs. The study found that high synapses had lower voltage thresholds, shorter latencies, and higher release rates compared to low syn, supporting the hypothesis that I synaptic heterogeneity contributes to the diversity of SGN firing.
The study investigates the role of PfOR, a protein in Plasium falciparum, the deadliest human malaria parasite, in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression throughout its lifecycle. PfOR is a member of the MOR protein family, conserved in plants and animals, involved in DNA methylation and heterochatin formation. The study uses CRISPR/C9 genome editing to add a HA tag to PfOR and generate transgenic parasites. Immunofluorescence and pull-down experiments confirm PfOR localizes to the nucleus and interacts with Api2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigen players associated with heterochatin. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and Hi experiments show PfOR is essential for tight gene regulation and heterochatin compaction, preventing access to promoters and transcription machinery in stage-specific manner. Downregulation of PfOR reduces H3me in heterochatin clusters and 5' flanking var and rif genes. PfOR interacts with AP-G during asexual cycle, suggesting it controls AP-G and sexual differentiation. The study suggests PfOR is a repressor of parasite-specific genes, including egress and invasion, and antigen variation between troozoite and schizont stages. Targeting PfOR complexes may lead to antiparas strategies.
This study investigated the connection between cancer and the brain, specifically in the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HCC), a type of cancer that affects the oral cavity. Researchers found that HCC is associated with innervation by sensory neurons, which release the neuropeptide substance P, driving cell proliferation and migration. Patients with HCC often experience depression, which is poorly managed clinically. The study demonstrated that HCC-infiltrating nerves connect to a pre-existing brain circuit, including the trigeminal ganglion, spinal of the trigeminal nucleus, and parabrach nucleus, and amygdala. This connection is independent of pain and drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. Elimination of TR1-expressing nocicept neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. The study suggests a complex interplay between sensory, cancer, progression, and mental health, uncovering a two-prong approach to improve HCC patients' physical and psychological well-being. Tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established circuit, extending from the bed to T ganglion, connecting to Spc, and projecting to brain, influencing behavior in pain-dependent and independent ways. This paves the way for in-depth exploration of mechanistic underpinnings of cancer-associated alterations in well-being and mental, shedding light on potential interventions to alleviate effects. Animal studies were performed with approval from Institutional Care Use Committee at Sanford and complied with relevant regulations. Mice were maintained in pathogen-free facility with specific pathogen-free conditions. Tumors were implanted orthotically in oral cavity of C57/6 mice. Tumor growth monitored by caliper measurements and volume calculated using formula.

The article explores the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the biophysical properties of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a multifunctional protein essential for viral replication and assembly. The study utilizes a large dataset of 5.06 million high-quality SARS-2 sequences to analyze the mutational landscape of N-protein, finding that 43% of residues are capable of assuming 4-5 different amino acids without impairment of viability. The highest mutation frequency occurs in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which comprise half of the protein and allow large conformation fluctuations. Nprotein scaffolds genomic RNA for virion assembly via nucleic acid (NA)-induced conformation changes and oligomerization, forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. N-pro is also multifunctional, binding multiple host proteins to modulate or exploit pathways, including stress granules, type 1 interferon signaling, and the NLR inflamome.

The study examines the physico properties of N-pro across the mutant spectrum, including polarity, hydrophobicity, and charge, finding significant variation in the IDRs, particularly the SR-rich and L-rich regions of the linker, and the N3 region of the C-arm. These distinctions are likely functionally important, with the SR linker's polarity aiding NA binding, the L region's hydroobicity aiding assembly, and the N3 region playing a role in NA and-protein interactions. Nonlocal features are conserved in related coronaviruses, providing examples of nonlocal physico properties that are evolutionary conserved despite amino sequence divergence.

The study also investigates the impact of mutations on N-pro biophysical properties, including thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, intra- and intermolecular interactions, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Results show that mutations can modulate these properties via weak interactions in transient structures, and the flexibility of IDRs magnifying nonlocal consequences. The study highlights the importance of IDRs in viral evolution, their flexibility making them permissible for amino changes, mimicking eukotic SLMs, and mediating biological functions and evolutionary constraints.
This study aimed to investigate the role of myosin in hibernation, a state of metabolic suppression used by small and large mammals to survive winter. Researchers isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators (Ictom trcematus and E quercus) and large hibernators (U arct and U american) and conducted Mant-AT chase experiments to assess myin conformation and ATP turnover. They found that myin states were unchanged in U ar and U during hibern, but altered in I and E during hibern, with increased ATP consumption in type II fibers. X-ray diffraction showed structural changes in I trcematus during hibern. Proteomics analysis revealed changes in sareric proteins and metabolic pathways in I trcem during hibern. The study suggests myin serves as a non-shiveringogenesis regulator in mammals, inhibited during hibern.

Chondrocy columns are a hallmark of growth architecture in the growth plate, which drives bone elongation. This study analyzed the 3D structure of clones in embryonic and postnatal growth plates using a modified 3D MAP. In the embryonic plate, uniclonal and multiclon columns are rare, and most form elongated clusters orthogonal to the longitudinal axis due to incomplete rotations during division. Postnatally, clones form complex columns from ordered and disordered stacks, as well as small orthogonally clusters. These morphologies correlate with the dynamics of growth elongation and expansion, suggesting clusters and columns support different growth strategies during embry and postnatal development. Column formation is viewed as a morphogenetic process during elong, where clones of P cells form stacks, aligning the axis with the bone. This restricts lateral density, maximizing hypertrophy along the elong axis. The study contradicts previous findings, revealing the need to reconsider underlying mechanisms. Several possibilities explain differences: earlier studies focused on division plane rotation, but analyzed small subsets or non-clonal doublets, or non-clonal doublets. Integrating aspects, it's difficult to confirm existence and determine clonal columns. Clusters may intercalate, forming nononal columns, explaining observed columnar chrocy in histological sections. Mechanisms of formation and elong may be regulated by organization into nononal columns or increase cell volume, a major driver of longitudinal growth. The growth plate must balance requirements and constraints, following multifunctional design. Embryonic bones expand as they elongate, supporting multifunction mechanism coping with growth. Elong clusters due to rotations may enable expansion. Disruption of polarity causes widening, while simulation predicts lack of division causes expansion. Postnat, expansion decreases while growth maintained, correlating with columns in the center and clusters on edges. Clusters may control morphology, articular cartilage form non-stypically, raising their function. Rotation of division underlies columns versus clusters. Mechanisms regulate division, providing adaptable between growth strategies. Simulation adhesion in the plate shows complete is energetically favorable, low rates suggest regulation. Fzangl/PCP, integrins, muscle, and matrix indicate mechanical and molecular signals. Revisiting factors and pathways in embry growth light of new findings.

Findings establish model formation, understanding mechanisms growth activity and elongation during development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of pharmaceutical interest due to their promiscuous binding site, which improves the oral bioavailability of various drugs. The POT family is conserved across phylogen kingdoms and functions by coupling peptide uptake to the electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM and alphold structures have provided insights into different conformation states of mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and S15A2. However, the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling remains unclear. This study employs unbiased and enhanced-sampling to map the S15A conformation cycle and thermodynamic forces. Conformation free landscapes in proton states show a sequence of protonation steps driving inward alternating access. Simulations identify differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, validated in cell transport assays. Results establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and recognition, revealing details of secondary transport in POTs. This study provides a step in understanding proton-coupled peptide transport in mammals and paves the way for integrating solute structural biology with drug design to target and bioavailability. Cells require an external membrane to separate their cytoplasm from the environment. The membrane permeability of solutes spans orders of magnitude, with some diffusing readily while others requiring facilitation by carriers. The sol-carrier (SLC) superfamily encompasses 65 genes with substrates ranging from ions to macromolecules in metabolism and signaling. The S15 family includes POTs with significant homology across domains and evolution. The four mammalian members, Pep1 (SLA1) and Pep2 (SL2), are well-studied, with Pep1 predominantly in the small intestine and Pep2 in kidneys, lungs, and brain. Secondary transporters couple substrate location to the sym of protons down their electrochemical. The peptide-proton stoichiometry is not conserved between substrates and POT members. Pep1 stoichiometries 1:1 and 2: have been reported for neutral and acidic-peptides, respectively. Pep2 stoichiomet 2:1 for Dhe-Ala-L and 3: for D-Glu. Alternatively, 1: stoichiometries were found for D-Gln, D-Glu, and D-Lys. POTs belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MF) with a conserved topology of six-helix forming the functional domain. They operate an alternating mechanism encoded in inverted repeats, reorienting N- and C-terminal bundles through OF, occluded (OCC), and in-facing (IF) states. The first POT structure was published (New et al., 2011) has been followed by many prokary (Sol et al 2012, Guo et 2013, et al 2013, et 2014, et al 201, et al 201, et al 201) and plant (Parker and New 201, et al 201) homologs. Several have been structurally and biochemically characterized, with varying degrees of occlusion. Residues have been suggested involved in proton transfer, including histidine TM2 (H) and glutamates TM1 and TM. Simulations have helped understanding proton processes and conformation changes. However, details of the mechanism remain unclear. Cryo and alphold have provided views of mammalian POT in OF, partially occluded, and IF states. The intracellular gate is constituted by hydroph residues TM4, 5, 10, and 11, with stabilization from the conserved D-K saltbridge. The extracellular appears along the cleft between N- and C bundles, with contributions from H, S, R, and K. This is intriguing, as mamm H is conserved only in proary homologs and R in mammalian POT. We speculate the extracellular mechanism may be less conserved than alternating.
This study investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during speech production and perception in 35 neurosurgical patients using intracran electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. Participants performed an auditory repetition task (AWR) where they heard and repeated an auditory stimulus, and a word reading task (WR) where they heard their own voice. The results showed that auditory regions responded more strongly during passive listening compared to speaking, verifying previous reports of response suppression during self-generated speech in cortex. To ensure the observed suppression was not due to repetition, a visual reading task (VR) was performed where participants heard their voice only once, and response magnitudes were similar to AW and WR tasks. A suppression index (SupI) was calculated for each electrode by comparing responses during listening and speaking in AW, showing strongest suppression in middle to posterior superior temporal gyrus (ST), followed by middle temporal gyrus (MT) and supramarginal gyrus (SM), and enhancement in motor regions, particularly postcentral gyrus (CG). 

The study aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, using a delayed auditory (DAF) task where participants repeated WR while receiving delayed feedback. Results showed overlapping sites in ST exhibited both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures, supporting the hypothesis that suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors. Additionally, responses in posterior ST were enhanced during DAF compared to normal production, even with simultaneous feedback, suggesting increased attentional modulation of feedback. 

The study also investigated the role of attention in auditory sensitivity by comparing responses during DAF and WR tasks. Results showed larger responses in posterior ST during D0 (simultaneous feedback in D task) compared to WR (simultaneous feedback standard reading), despite similar behavior in both conditions, interpreted as increased neural gain driven by attention. The posterior ST is critical in auditory-motor integration during monitoring, close to the ventral attention network.
A comprehensive census of Mcr systems among the most common forms of prokary Type IV restriction systems was conducted, revealing enormous diversity and complexity. The study focused on a previously uncharacterized branch, denoted CoNu, characterized by extensive coiled-co structures and nucleases. Three types and multiple subtypes of CoNu were identified, differing in domain composition and genomic association. CoNu systems contain domains interacting with translation components, such as Smp-like OB, H70 homologs, and YTH domains, along with RNases like HN, suggesting RNA targeting. Most CoNu have DNA-targeting activity, either by integral factors like McC nuclease or loosely associated systems like Type RM and Dant Type III. CoNu are associated with proteins containing CAR domains, suggesting cyclic oligonucleotide regulation. The presence of R-like CAR domains indicates specific messengers are RNA fragments with cyclic termini. CoNu, with ancillary factors, implement an echoned defense strategy like Type CRPR-C systems, eliminating virus and/or RNA first, then aborting infection leading to P/dorm via RNAavage. A search for McB and McC was seeded with CO140, AAA5, CO426, PF17, CO170, PF11, and PF23. Alignments were clustered, and position-specific matrices used PSI-BLAST against nr database. Neighborhoods were generated, and domains identified using CDD and Pfam. Filtering retained CO140 hits or both McB and McC aliases. McB candidates were clustered, aligned, and profile-profile similarity calculated. Clusters with high similarity were aligned, and analyzed with HH to remove false positives. Gase sequences were extracted, and used as queries for second PSI-BLAST. Abundance of CoNu and CoPAL types became apparent, and results included in pool hits. Filtering relaxed criteria included neighborhoods with one hit, adjacent, oriented, and sufficient size. Remaining data were clustered, and analyzed to remove positives. Automated procedure excised Gase sequences, and analyzed with HH to remove positives. Validation paired McB with Mc, and used for phylogen. Final Gase and D235 alignments were produced, and maximum-likelihood trees built. CoNu components were scrutinized with Waggagga, detecting coiled-coils in CA, CB, CC, CD, CH, and CE. Phylogen analysis of CoNu and UP1 helases was conducted, retrieving hits, combining, aligning, and constructing a tree. Annotations were mapped, and structures predicted with Alpha2. Single models were retained, and multimer analyzed. Models were used to search structurally similar proteins, and visualized with Chimera and RCSB.
Calcineur, a conserved from yeast to humans, is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threon protein phosphatase involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. Inhibition of calcine is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple pathways. To study the role of calcine in regulating immunity, we discovered that calcine is required for the rhythmic defecation program (DMP) in C. elegans. Calcine inhibition leads to defects in D, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal blo caused by calcine inhibition mimics effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for calcine-mediated lifespan extension. The nuclear receptor N-8 is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcine in C. elegans DMP and a new mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated extension. Interventions that enhance lifespan also impart resistance to multiple stresses. The relationship between lifespan and innate immunity is complex and remains to be fully understood. Calcine, a conserved from yeast to humans, is a calcium/calmod-dependent serine/threon phosphatase involved in diverse cellular processes. Dephosphorylation of substrates by calcine affects several pathways, including transcriptional programs. Calcine regulates the activity of transcription factors, the nuclear factor activated T (NF) family. Dephosphorylation NFs by calcine triggers nuclear localization and activates immune responses in vertebrates. In nemat Caenorhabis elegans, calcine regulates thermaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan. Knock of the catalytic subunit of calcine, tax-6, is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via pathways, including autagy and CRE-regulated transcription coactivators. However, the role of calcine in C. elegans response to pathogen has not been studied. C. elegans lacks NF transcription factors, making it intriguing to study how calcine impacts C. eleg immunity. We examined the effect of calcine inhibition on C. eleg immunity. Surprisingly, we found that knock of tax-6 enhanced susceptibility of C. eleg to bacterial infection despite lifespan. We discovered tax- is for the rhythmic defation program D. Knock of tax- resulted in intestinal blo due to defects in D, which enhanced susceptibility to infection by increasing gut colonization by bacteria. Intestinal blo resulted in calorie-like phenotypes, reduced lipid levels, and increased lifespan. We discovered the TF orth, HL-30, required for calcine inhibition lifespan. The nuclear receptor N- is upregulated by calcine and necessary for increased. Our studies a new mechanism for calcine inhibition extension.
This study aimed to investigate the representation of conflict in the brain using a parametric manipulation of conflict levels. The researchers used a Stro-Simon paradigm, which combines Stro and Simon conflicts, to parametrically manipulate conflict levels. They found that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlFC) encoded conflict parametrically, supporting the hypothesis that conflict types are represented in a cognitive space. The dlFC is a key region involved in conflict processing and control. The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine the neural representation of conflict. RSA is a technique that measures the similarity between multivoxel patterns of brain activity. The researchers found that the dlFC encoded conflict parametric, with stronger activation when conflict was present. They also found that the dlFC was more active in incongruent than congr conditions. The study suggests that conflict is represented in a cognitive space, reconciling the debate between domain-general and domain views of control. The dlFC guides control to goal-directed behavior, suggesting that different control states are encoded in an abstract space. The study provides evidence for the geometry of cognitive space representing information in control. Future research should examine other aspects of the space, such as its dimensionality and applicability to other tasks. The study enrolled 33 college students in experiment 1 and 36 in experiment 2, with a final sample of 35. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science. Informed consent was obtained from subjects. Functional imaging was performed on a 3T GE scanner using echo-planar imaging (EPI) sensitive BOLD contrast. The preprocessed fMRI data were analyzed with a general linear model (GL) to estimate voxel-wise activity for each condition. The GL included incongruent and congr conditions as main regressors and a parametric modulator for each condition. The parameters for Stro, StSm, Stm, Stm, and Simon were -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The researchers also added event nuisance regressors, including error/miss trials, outlier trials, and within TR of head motion. The GL was convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF) and added volume nuisance regressors, including head parameters, global, white matter, CSF, and TR. Low-frequency drifts were filtered using a period of 128. The two runs were regarded as sessions and incorporated a GL to get power. This yielded beta maps for inconuent and congr conditions, and each subject. Paired tests were conducted between inconuent and congr, for effect and param modulation. The spatialro and Simon change in opposite each other, so positive effect reflect higher activation when more Simon, and negative reflect higher activation more Stro. The results were corrected with probabilistic-free enhancement (TF) and thresholded 3Clust function in AFNI. To visualize parametric effects, a GL was conducted with inconuent and congr conditions as regressors no param. The beta-coefficients were extracted for each regress and participant regions in GL regions of interest, and inconuent-congr contrasts each type individual. The results were reported in Figure 3, Table, and Figure—supplement. A GL aimed to prepare RSA, unsmoothed images were used. The model included event regressors for 5 conflict x 2 x 2 conditions. The event nuisance regressors were similar GL, with response and post trials. The GL was conducted for each run, yielding voxel activation per condition and subject. To measure neural similarity, RSA was conducted on 360 cortical regions MMP atlas. The estimates were noise-normalized by dividing by square of error terms. Each region calculated Pearson correlations f activity for run and subject, yielding 140 RSM. The were cross-voxel using activation GL described. Within-sub cells were excluded, and converted
This study investigated the vaginal immunopome, a collection of immune mediators in the vaginal fluid, to predict preterm birth (PT) in a high-risk population. The researchers collected vaginal swabs from 739 pregnant women, 281 samples, and analyzed 31 mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides. They found that the immunome undergoes changes throughout gestation, with a decline in pro-inflammatory mediators and increase in T-associated chemines and growth factors. In women who experienced PT, the immunome was skewed towards a pro-inflammatory state, with increased monocyte chemokines, macroage cytokines, and T-cell mediators. The study identified specific mediators associated with PT, including IL-6, IL-1, IL-16, CX8, TN, IF-γ, IL-α, and LTα, which were increased in PT cases compared to controls. Monocyte chemines C2, C3, and C4 were also increased in PT. Macrophage cytokines IL-12p and IL-15 were increased in late PT. T-cell mediators IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, IL-10, IL-13, IL-5, CX10, and C17 were increased in specific subsets of PT. Antimicrobial peptides β-defin-2 and SLPI were decreased in early PT. Growth factors GMF, VEG, and IL-7 showed distinct patterns. The study found that adjustment for maternal characteristics provided a more stringent model, and that PT cases shared a common inflammatory profile but with subtle differences between subsets. The immunome was used to generate non-invasive biomarkers for PT with improved value over maternal and clinical information. Random forest models predicted PT and subsets, with the highest value for early preterm PROM (AUC=0.787). The inclusion of maternal characteristics improved prediction for PT, but not early PT. The immunome was compared to sonographic length, with comparable value for early PROM, but length was better for PT.
The Hernandez-Hern model is a computational model that describes the electrical activity and Ca2+ signaling in isolated mesenteric smooth muscle cells. The model incorporates sex-specific differences in currents from male and female cells and includes ionic channels, pumps, and transporters. The model was validated with experimental data from male and female myocytes and used to reveal sex-specific mechanisms of KV.1 and Ca2 channels controlling membrane and Ca dynamics. The model predicts that few channels are needed to sustain oscillatory behavior of membrane and calcium signaling. The model was expanded to include a 1D representation of electrotonically coupled tissue by connecting myocytes in series, showing smoothing effect of electrotonic coupling on tissue. The model predicted differences in response of male and female myocytes to drugs and underlying mechanisms for differences. Predictions may contribute to better hypertensive therapy for males and females.

The Hernandez-Hern model includes ionic models of IC, IK2.1, and IK5, optimized using the approach by Kern et al., 2019. The model encapsulates cumulative effect of stochastic channel activity on voltage through fluctuating term in membrane equation. The ideal 1D representation of vessel was developed by connecting Hernandez-Hern cells in series via resistances, showing smoothing effect of electrotonic on tissue. The baseline in male and female smooth cells were analyzed through sensitivity assessment using multivar linear regression. The scope of sensitivity encompassed variations in maximal conduct and transport of transmembrane currents.

The model was used to simulate the effect of clinically relevant calcium blocker nifipine on Ca2 influx in male and female myocytes. Results showed nifine decreases Ca2i by 22-25% in male and 38-45% in female at 80-120 mmHg. The model suggests female smooth muscle is more sensitive to clinically Ca2 blockers than male muscle. The Hernandezern model was expanded to include receptor-mediated pathways essential for blood control. Excitation-contraction refers stimulus driving release of calcium from SR and physical contraction. The model did not explicitly describe contraction, but implied by membrane and Cai as proxy.

The model was informed and validated with murine data, but future research should assess applicability in humans. The Hernandezern model provides basis for simulating effect of drugs within vessel and may contribute to better hypertensive therapy for males and females.
This study investigated how climate interacts with decomposers of different sizes to influence litter decomposition. Litter baskets of different sizes were placed along a sharp precipitation gradient during hot-dry summer and again during colder-wetter. Decomposers responded differently to precipitation based on size, leading to similar decomposition rates across the gradient, except in hyperid sites. Microbial decomposition was minimal in the summer, while microbial was positively associated with precipitation in the winter, governing whole decomposition. Mesofunal decomposition was moderate and followed a h-shaped to precipitation, peaking in semiar sites. Macrocomposition contributed minimally to whole decomposition in the winter, but dominated in the arid sites in the summer. Pit trapping revealed macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a h-shaped to precipitation, peaking inid environments. Litter removal differed across seasons, sites, and sizes, and interactions were significant. On average, litter was 2.6 higher in winter than summer, 1.6 in meso than micro, and 1.3 in macro than meso. Litter was negligible in hyperid during both seasons, while highest in arid during summer and in moreic during winter. Site and season comparisons between sizes yielded differences in Avdat, Sayer Sh, and Hav Shm, indicating faunal effects were found underid to semiar conditions. Macro and mesa effects were detected in arid, while semiar Hav Shm site exhibited only mesa effect both. Macro, mesa, and micro contributions litter loss peaked underid, semiar, and Mediterranean conditions, respectively. Whole litter rates were dictated micro in winter and macro in summer, resulting in comparable rates across the gradient from Mediterranean to arid at annual. Macrocomposer abundance, biomass, and richness peaked inid during both seasons. Macrocomposer assemblage differed across sites and seasons, with woodlice, milliped, and snails substituted by ants and termites increasing aridity. Assemblage was affected by site-season interaction, with site explaining most variability, season a smaller fraction, and site-season an intermediate. Pairwise comparisons across sites yielded differences assemblage. Ants were most abundant, while beetles accounted most biomass, but underic, woodlice, milliped, and snails were dominant. Ram Haniv assemblage was distinct, with high Bray-Curt dissimilarity to other sites.
The study investigates the role of CY-B in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development, progression, and metastasis using the KPC mouse model and derived tumour cells. CY-B is highly expressed in human PDAC and correlates with poorer survival, suggesting a potential role in tumigenesis and metastasis. Deletion of CY in the pancreas, with expression of KRAS12 and p53, accelerates Pan formation and increases phospho-ER and phospho-JNK, crucial targets of KR and RAC that drive proliferation and expansion. CY-B buffers R1 activity in tumigenesis, but other explanations include mitochondrial superoxide production and epithelial polarity maintenance. CY-B is involved in chemactic migration, a mechanism for reduced metastasis observed in the K model and intraperitone transplant of PD metastasis. CY-B and NASP control different aspects of LPAR recycling, internalisation and sorting. Tumours overexpress CY-B but are highly metastatic, paradoxically, CY-B opposes R1 activity, requiring balance activation and inactivation for chemaxis and macinocyt. CY-B internalises L1 via macinocytosis, a key receptor trafficking mechanism in cancer cells. The study uses CRIS-C9 genome editing to generate CY-B knockout cell lines and investigates CY-B expression, proliferation, chemaxis, and internalisation of L1. CY-B is highly expressed in PDAC and correlates with poorer survival, suggesting a role in tumigen and metastasis. Deletion CY in pancreas with KR12 and p accelerates Pan formation and phospho-ER and phosph-J, targets of KR and R that drive proliferation and expansion. CY buffers R1 in tumigen, but explanations include superoxide and polarity. CY is involved in chem migration, mechanism reduced metastasis in K and intraper transplant PD. CY and NASP control LPAR internalisation and sorting. Tumours overexpress CY but highly metastatic, paradoxically CY opposes R1, requiring activation and inactivation for chem and macin. CY internal L via macin, key trafficking in cancer.
This study characterizes a clade of HERV H-2-related endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in rhes macaques and other Old World Monkeys (OWMs) that originated from a recombination between HERV H-2 and HERV K. The recombinant viruses, called SERV/MER, have a chimer env gene with surface and transmembrane subunits derived from HER-2 and transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail from HER K. The noncoding region is derived from HER K LTR, known as MER. The study estimates the recombination event occurred 20-25 million years ago, before the split between coline and cercitine subfamilies of OW, but after split between apes and OW. Orthologs of oldest insertions are found in both subfamilies OW, not apes. Majority of recombin provir inhes are younger, including two clades ofhes-specific insertions. Many youngir are insertion polymorphic and present low in macques, 36 have identical LTR. This suggests infectious activity HER-like viruses inhes macques within 500,000 years and potential ongoing replication. The study investigates coding capacity of provir, identifying full-length ORFs for gag, pro, pol, and env genes. Two prov have intact gag-pol region, potentially making retroiral cores, lacking env. Sequence of consensus SER/MER is 89.2% identical to HERcon, Gag, Pro, Pol, Env 78.5, 91, 82.5%. Although diverged, basic H-2 biology conserved. Many prov have deletions in coding regions, not replication-competent. LTRs SER/M have major changes, large deletions in U region. Deletions accumulated over millions, unique in viral lineages converging U region. Most deletions overlap Response Element (RE) human H-2.

This study investigated the impact of Enterococcus faalis (E. faalis) infection on wound healing in a mouse model. E. faalis is a common gut bacterium that can cause infections, including surgical site infections and diabetic ulcers. The researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model. They analyzed over 23,000 cells and created a comprehensive atlas of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of wounds. The analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing. The study identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibro transcriptomes in response to infection, contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faalis prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2 macroage polarization. Macrophages interacted with neutils, regulating chemine signaling and anti-inflammatory with endothelial cells. The findings provide new insights into the immunosup role of E. fa in infections, which pose a challenge to wound healing, affecting the skin's barrier and repair mechanisms. The study highlights the complexity of the skin's cellular heterogeneity and the intricate dynamics of wound healing following infection.
Researchers investigated the temporal dynamics of volatile emission and response between herbivore-att and undamaged maize plants using a custom-built high-throughput proton transfer time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) system. They found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbiv-induced volatiles (HIPs) results in a clocked response in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terp burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. The burst is not explained by terene accumulation during the night but coincides with delayed jasmon accumulation in receiver plants. The burst occurs independently of day-night transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender dynamics. Instead, it is the result of stress from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second. The study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress volat results in a response that integrates priming and induction into a distinct and predictable pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question whether volatiles induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, revealing they can both in sequence.

Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount responses to herbivores, including herbore-induced plant volatiles (HIPs). HIPs can enhance plant defenses and increase resistance to herbivory when perceived by undamaged plants. HIPs can directly induce plant defenses by increasing hormone and volatile release, or via priming, increasing defenses to a secondary stimulus. The researchers found that two phenomena operate together to trigger defense in receiver plants with predictable kinetics. Continuous exposure to HIPs results in the same pattern without need for another stimulus, indicating HIPs are sufficient to trigger robust, clock activation in neighboring.

The mechanism of strong activation on the onset of second of HIP exposure involves GL, which directly induce and prime jasmon production and terene release. Indole can prime but not directly these responses. GL and indole interact to increase priming upon secondary. The researchers propose that on day 1, plants are exposed to GL, triggering a burst in receiver, and primed to respond strongly on next. At onset of second, GL emission increases, defense mechanism kicks in, terene activated, and stomata open, resulting in strong burst. The orchestration of elements results in predictable pattern under HIP exposure.

The ecological relevance of clock temporal activation in neighboring is proposed to avoid energy expenditure, maximize indirect defenses, and attract natural enemies. Responding on second may be advantageous as natural would have located and interacted with herbiv on sender, ready to move to next plant. Fitness outcomes are nuanced, considering HIP also attract herbiv. Investigation into transfer multi-plant, multi-trophic will be critical.
Researchers have discovered that wild orangutans exhibit recursive vocal patterns in their calls, specifically in the form of isochrony, which is a rhythmic pattern where elements are repeated at a consistent tempo. The study analyzed audio recordings of 66 calls from 10 orangutans in the wild and found that five types of elements comprise the building blocks of long calls, including full pulses, grumble-pulses, sub-p transitory elements, pulse bodies, and bubble-pulses. The researchers extracted intervals between elements (IOIs) and calculated the rhythmic ratio by dividing IO by the duration of the following element. The distribution of ratios showed that full pulses and sub-p exhibited isochron characteristics, with peaks around 0.5, indicating regular pacing at a 1:1 ratio. The model showed that pulse type, range, and interaction had a significant effect on the count of values, with full pulses isochron peak significant. Three of four orang sub-p element types, grumble-p, sub-p trans, and bubble-p, also showed peaks around isron. The sub-p were regularly paced within full pulses, denoting isochy within isochy at different tempi. Permutant function analysis confirmed that sub-p categories were acoustically distinct. The study suggests that orangans perceive sub-p rhythmic motifs as a train of signals, not one uninterrupted. The occurrence of non-exclusive patterns decreases the probability of recursion being a by-product of anatomical constraints. The data stimulate questions the relationship between oscillators and combinatority, which is difficult to investigate in the wild. The findings suggest recursive isochy is not absolute of raw mechanics but likely generated by a tempor recursive procedure. The occurrence of non-exclusive patterns drives the likelihood of orangans concatenating call and sub-p in a linear fashion without a recursive process. The study revolutionizes how to approach the evolution of recursion along the human lineage beyond all-orthing accounts. The discovery of recursive patterns in a great ape in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music opens a charter for incipient and transitional states among homids. The findings invite renewed interest in reanalysis of primate combinator in the wild. Given the dearth of data, it may be hasty to discuss combinator capacities in primates or birds equivalent to engaged syntax or phonology.
The study investigates the evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts, focusing on the interaction between viral receptors and viruses, specifically the MDA receptor and 5'pp-R virus in the lower vertebrate Miichthys mii. The researchers found that the frequent and independent loss of R-I in vertebrates led to the search for alternative substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the main pathway. They discovered that MDA of M. mii and G. gallus, homolog of R-I, can replace R-I in recognizing 5'pp-R virus, leading to redundancy of R-I loss from the species during evolution. Additionally, as an adversarial strategy, 5pp-R virus utilizes m6 methylation to degrade MDA and weaken its antiv immune ability, promoting its own replication and immune evasion. The study provides a snapshot of the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system. The recognition pattern receptors (PRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular (PAMP) motifs, including proteins, lipids, and nucleotides, activating innate responses in the host. Retic-induced I-like receptors (R) are a group of PR belonging to the D/D-box helicase family, playing a crucial role in antiv response. There are three members in the R family: retino-ac-inducible I (I), melan differentiation gene 5 (DA), and laboratory of genetics 2 (LG2). I and DA exhibit similar characteristics and homology, including N-terminal casp-recruitment domains (CARD), D-box helic domain, and C-terminal repressor domain (RD). The roles of I and DA in response to virus are not redundant: I detects blunt-end RNA with 5-triph motif 5pp-R, while DA specifically recognizes long forms of viral RNA. In contrast, the involvement of LG2 in cyolic sensing is a topic of debate. Some studies propose LG2 crucial for production type I interferon (IF-I) in response to I- and DA-dependent viruses, while others describe LG2 as a negative regulator of I signaling. Despite the immune functions of R members, they have been lost from the genome in many species, including mammals, birds, and fish. 5pp-R is present in various RNA viruses, including Flaviridae, Paramoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyoviridae, and Rhaboviridae families, infecting all life forms and causing serious diseases. The study selected teleost M. mii croaker and chicken G. gallus, vertebrates lacking I, and 5pp-R viruses SCRV and VSV to investigate evolutionary strategies between 5-R virus and host. The results showed MDA of M. mii and G. gall can recognize 5pp-R, and SC virus utilizes m6 to degrade MDA for immune evasion. The findings shed light on the diversity of antiv activity and unveil a complex race between virus and immunity in vertebrates.
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), and turnover in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (PC) undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Twenty-nine consecutive PC patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and underwent administration of luteizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degare. Body mass (BM), lean mass (LBM), and bone density (BMD) were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months of AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal peptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH levels and BM at arms and legs, but a stronger correlation was observed between F and total BM, fat at arms, and trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship was observed between F and appendicular lean index/BM ratio. After 6 months, F levels showed a direct relationship with total BM and fat at arms, trunk, and legs, while an inverse with appendicular lean/BM ratio. After 12, F maintained a significant relationship with total BM, fat at arms, and trunk. The study suggests that F levels after AD could impact body composition, particularly BM, and F could be a marker to monitor risk of sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in evaluation of body in PC patients AD.
A study investigated the effects of Ry2 inhibition on sudden cardiac death (SCD) and heart failure (HF) in a guinea pig model. The model replicates key features of human non-ischemic HF, including spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The primary endpoint was SC, and secondary was cardiac contractility measured by echocardiography. Animals were randomized to receive dantene (DS) or placebo in the early stages of HF. DS prevented VT and SC by decreasing dispersion repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart variability and function. Inhibition of Ry2 with DS mitigated the vicious cycle of sarcoplasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca+ and ROS-mediated Ry2 oxidation, reducing repolar lability and protecting against VT/SC. Moreover, the consequent increase sarcasm Ca+ load improved contract function. These life-saving effects of Ry2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dene as a new therapy for HF and SC.

The study used a pressure overload guinea model of HF/SC with spontaneous arrhythm. Unique to this model is the high incidence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and VT, leading to SC in two-thirds of animals within 4 weeks. Notably, SC occurs early, in the first 2 weeks of cardiac hypertrophy, even before heart dilates into failure. The primary endpoint was SC, and secondary was cardiac contractility measured by echardi at weeks. To determine if DS can be used as a therapeutic, treated HFSC animals with and without DS in the early stages of failure. Animals exhibit frequent PVCs that trigger sustained and non-sust VT, causing SC. DS reduced the rate of PVCs in early and late HF and improved survival. Compared the HF group, the HF+ group had a higher survival rate (55% vs 80 in HF+, p0.05). Cardiac structure and function were preserved in animals with DS compared to HF. In contrast, the HF group did not display significant dilation of the left ventricle (LV) at the 4 endpoint. Echardi measures showed the relative wall thickness (RWT), a marker of LV dysfunction, was lower in HF compared to control.

Analysis of myocardial structure showed an increase in interstitial fibrosis in HF compared to normal. The fibrotic tissue was higher in untreated HF compared to normal, whereas the HF+ group displayed lower fibrosis, confirming DS therapy delayed progression, keeping architecture intact. Interstitial fibrosis is associated with progression and lethal arrhythm due reentry. The study tested if DS prevented downstream damages by quantifying oxidation of Ry2 and without DS. Ry2 was reduced in HF+ group compared to HF. As protocol, all animals received daily isoproenolus for 1 hr. The heart was elevated in response to β-adnerg and recovered resting 3-4 hr later. We assessed ECG at resting and post-st recovery. As expected, adequately respond to demand and workload, failing hearts fine-tune resting. HF had significant elevation resting rate compared normal. HF+ animals demonstrated lower rate similar to normal. Paired analysis showed HF increased rate 20-40 bpm, whereas HF+ decreased 20-30. The histogram depicts distribution rate over 24 hr from normal, HF, and HF+ groups, decreased rate in HF+. Despite resting rate, peak to β-stress was lower HF than HF+ group, indicative therapeutic role DS in restoring competency.

The study tested hypothesis DS prevents VT and SC by repolar abnormalities. Detailed ECG revealed inhibition Ry2 leak prevents VT and SC. Variability prolongation known prognostic in failing. Prolonged QT considered risk arrhythm, heter
This study investigated the roles of Smad and Schnur transcription factors in the Caenorhabdis elegans larva using genome-wide RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (Ch-seq). The second larval (L) stage was chosen for analysis due to elevated Smad activity and clear phenotypic differences in body growth. Ch-se detected numerous SMA-3 and SMA-9 binding sites, with a large number potentially due to low affinity and degenerate DNA recognition. BETA analysis combined Ch-se and RNA-se data to identify direct targets, while Luper Overlap Analysis (LO) integrated separate RNA-se comparisons to identify shared differentially expressed genes (DE). SMA-3 and SMA- targets were co-regulated, with SMA-3 acting primarily as a transcriptional activator and SMA- as either activator or repressor depending on the locus. Double mutants showed antagonistic interactions, with SMA-9 partially suppressing SMA- small size phenotype. RT-PCR confirmed SMA- and SMA function at locus-specific levels, with SMA- activation dependent on SMA- for some genes. SMA-exclusive targets were enriched in chaper and collagen factors, while SMA-9-exclusive targets were in lipid and innate immunity. Functional analysis confirmed SMA- and SMA roles in body growth, with SMA-exclusive targets in one-car metabolism and chaper/secretion. The study highlights the importance of combining RNA-se and Ch-se to identify biologically relevant targets and the complex interactions between Smad and Schnur factors in C. elegans.
A study investigated the role of the embryonic transcription factor DUX in metastatic cancer and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for immunotherapy resistance. DUX was found to be expressed in 10-50% of advanced cancers, including bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers, and was associated with immune evasion and reduced response to PD-1 blockade in a cohort of urothelial patients. DUX expression was a significant predictor of survival, even accounting for tumor mutational burden and clinical features, and was associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. The study suggests that DUX could be a biomarker and therapeutic target for immunotherapy resistance. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy uses monoclonal antibodies to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses, but many patients fail to respond due to de novo or acquired resistance. Diverse mechanisms modulate sensitivity and resistance to ICI, including defects in Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class-mediated antigen presentation, PTEN and LSD1 inactivation, T cell dysfunction, specific T populations in the tumor environment, and WNT-β-caten signaling. Tumor-intrinsic interferon-gamma (IF-γ) signaling is important in anti-tumor immunity, inducing MHC class-mediated processing and presentation. DUX suppresses IF-γ activity and antigen presentation, promoting immune evasion and decreased CD8+ T activation. DUX is aberrantly expressed in some cancers, including testicular and breast carcinomas, and suppresses cell presentation and response to IF-γ. The study found that DUX is common in metastatic and associated with immune evasion, mirroring primary and cell models, and correlated with patient survival under I treatment. The prognostic value of IF- activity and its nonduancy relative to mutational burden in I response is appreciated. DUX has been implicated in modifying IF- activity through direct inhibition of STAT1. The study comprehensively demonstrates DUX modulates patient response PD-1 blockade and its expression in metast is correlated with downregulation of TIT and other immune checkpoints. DUX is a panancer biomarker and screening could stratify patients according I response. The study motivates investigation into DUX's prognosticating response I, but is limited by availability of I-treated cohorts with relevant data.
This study aimed to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in Tanzania through a surveillance platform established in pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems. Between 2017-2019, 215 cases of abortion were reported, with 71 in cattle, 44 in sheep, and 100 in goats investigated. Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock surveillance, even at small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease, reproductive losses, and identify pathogens not captured through other forms of disease surveillance. The study demonstrated the feasibility of a surveillance system through community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms. Livest reproductive losses, including abortion, are major concerns worldwide, resulting in significant economic loss and public health threats. Impacts on the world's poorest livestock-keepers, dependent on food and livelihoods, are substantial. Loss of foetus and milk reduces availability, essential for childhood growth and development. Reproductive losses reduce income, sales, and assets, critical for wealth and safety. Surveillance is defined as real-time collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health data for early identification of threats. Effective health provides data-based approaches to disease management, but requires reliable, high-quality, timely data from multiple sources.
This study investigated the effects of nicotine (NIC) on intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in mice. NIC is a major component of cigarette smoke and has been linked to various diseases, but its effects on ISC are not well understood. Researchers found that NIC increased ISC abundance and proliferative activity in vivo and ex vivo. NIC also induced Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcription coactivator with PDZ motif (TAZ) and Not signaling in ISC via nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) and protein C activation. This effect was not observed in Pan cells. Inhibition of Not signaling by dibenzepine (DB) nullified NIC effects on ISC. NIC enhanced tumor formation from ISC after loss of tumor suppressor gene APC, and DB inhibited NIC-induced growth. This study identifies NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity of ISC and suggests DB as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. Tissues are generated from stem cells, and abnormal stem functions are associated with age-related organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis. Intestinal epithelial turnover is sustained by ISC and Pan cells. Pan cells constitute the niche for ISC at the bottom of crypts. Most ISC are leucine-rich-protein-coupled receptor 5 (L5)-positive and regulate homeostasis in response to dietary signals. In the intestine, L5ISC are possibly the origin of precancerous adenomas. Long-term high-fat diet-induced obesity enhances self-renew potential of ISC and promotes tumor formation via induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated delta in ISC. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor associated with colon cancer, along with metabolic factors like diet and obesity. Studies indicate smoking is associated with colon and mortality in humans and animal models. Cigaret contains harmful compounds, including nicotine, 4-methylnitamino-1-3-pyrid-1-butan (NN) and N-nitrosnicotine (NN), which are carcinogenic and induce tumor suppress genes like p53 and Rb. Although nicotine is addictive, it has limited ability to initiate cancer, it stimulates effects for development independently. This study aimed to demonstrate effects of NIC on ISC ex vivo and in vivo and explore factors and cascades associated with regulation. Histological analysis of intestine C57/6 mice treated with NIC revealed NIC decreased villus length without affecting crypt size, consistent with NIC-induced decrease in number of differentiated cells, including absorptive enterocytes and endocrine cells. NIC exposure increased abundance of Ki-positive cells in small and large intestine. Consistently, number of prolifer olfactin (Om)-positive ISC significantly increased in small intestine of NIC-treated mice. Moreover, number of leucine-rich stem cells (CSC) increased in NIC-treated L5-EG-IRESre2 mice. Pan cells support proliferation of ISC but did not change in NIC mice. Results indicate self-renew of ISC in NIC mice with reciprocal decrease in number of differentiated cells. ISC analysis using crypt of wild mice revealed range of NIC concentrations promoted organoid formation from small intestine, consistent with vivo data. Cotinine, minor alkaloid and metabolite of NIC, did not exhibit similar effects. Addition of NIC promoted organoid formation from colonic crypt. To address ISC and Pan cell interaction, L5 ISC and Pan cells isolated from control or NIC L5-EG-IRES2 mice were co-cultured with glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor CH990, which induces beta-caten and stimulates organoid formation. L5 ISC from NIC formed more organoid than isolated from control with or without Pan cells. Consistently, addition of NIC to control ISC stimulated organoid formation. Pan cells exhibited no difference in organ formation between control and NIC groups or CH990. This ex vivo assay for ISC function and ISC-Pan cell interaction demonstrated NIC stimulates ISC without affecting Pan cell function. The pathway
The article discusses the role of Hsp70, a cellular chaper, and its co-chaper H110 in protein disaggregation. H70 is an ATP-dependent chaper that refolds misfolded proteins, while H110 is a nucleotide exchange factor (NE) that stimulates H70's activity. The authors investigated the impact of H110 on H70-dependent disaggregation using biochemical assays and biolayer interferometry (BLI). They found that H110 boosts H70 binding to aggregates, especially with class J coaper B, which interacts with the EE motif of H70. This interaction is crucial for the initial stages of disaggregation, including chaper recruitment and disassembly, but not protein folding. The authors also showed that H110-dependent loading of H70 onto aggregates correlates with remodelling into smaller species, improving recognition by the H104 disagase. However, high H110 levels inhibit disaggregation, and the effect depends on the phase and composition of the H70 system, with a crucial role of the NE's affinity for H70. The authors propose that H110 disrupts the H-J interaction, suggesting competition between J and H coaper. The balance between partners in the H system is key for efficient disaggregation, as individual coaper with a function at one step may inhibit another. They used biochemical assays reflecting individual stages of disag and found that H110 with BDP increases H70 aggregate binding, which correlates with final reactivation, implying initiation determines overall efficiency. However, final folding relies more on ADP Y1 than S1, and not S1 altogether. The degree of stimulation with BDP has been observed, but without insight for H110 and NE BAG. The distinguishing feature for specificity is the auxiliary between C domain S1 and EE motif H70. S1 E variant, deprived of EE, exhibits similar binding without S1 to Y1, but cannot bind misfold and prevent aggregation. The authors demonstrate sigmoid aggregate kinetics for S1-S1, suggesting cooperativity, conserved in yeast and human, implying mechanistic similarities. H110 shortens initial phase and boosts efficacy, loading a thicker H70 onto aggregates, as shown for amyloid. This corresponds H70 clustering on amyloid with H110, reported. Clustered H70 generates entropic effect leading to fibril fragmentation. The authors propose local extraction of polype by H-JB-H110, penetrates surface and apart amorph aggregates, generating manageable substrates for chaper, demonstrated by derepressed H104. H70 activity yields low re, but relevant for fragmentation linear amyloid. Clustering-aug remod and fragmentation, expanding surface, leads to improved re by H104. Despite heterogenic nature of cellular aggregates, disag by H104 relies on H110-boosted processing H70.
This study aimed to characterize data from a wearable insole device, Moticon, and demonstrate its utility relative to a standard force plate, and investigate analytical methods and types for analysis relevant clinical questions. Three datasets were integrated for analysis. The Gait force plate vF dataset contained force control subjects (N=211) and injury (N=625) (Hak et al., 2020).

Researchers have developed a non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain using a human tissue product called Clarix Flo (FLO), which is a micronized and lyophilized form of human amniotic membrane (AM) and umbilical cord (UC) matrix. The product is used for surgical and nonurgical repair, reconstruction, or replacement of soft tissue filling in connective tissue voids. LO has been shown to orchestrate regenerative healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-scarring properties in ophthalmic applications and relieve pain in ocular surface disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and lower extremity neuropathy. In a plantar-incision mouse model of posturgical pain, LO was explored as a viable biologic for treatment. The researchers purified heavy-hyalonic acid/paxin 3 (HA/PT3), a major component of LO, which is uniquely abundant in human tissues. HA/PT3 alleviates dry eye disease by suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands. The study investigated whether HA/3 is key to LO's pain-inhibitory effects and examined its mode of action. Intraaw injection of LO, but not vehicle, acutely inhibited nocice in wild-type (WT) mice. LO dose-dependently attenuated heat hypersensitivity in hindp receiving plantarincision and inhibited mechanical hypergesia in Randall-Sell test. The Cat assay showed LO normalized impaired gait caused by incision, indicating attenuation of movement-evoked pain common after surgery. LO caused no impairment locomotor or exploratory activity in open-field, symptoms known opioid side effects. Concentration of LO used fell within reported clinical studies. Nocice neuron hyperexcitability leads to pain, mechanisms of inhibition by LO can be inferred from its modulatory effects on neurons' excitability. Researchers employed PCre;R26slCa6 mice that express GCa6, a calcium indicator, in sensory neurons to high-throughput in vivo imaging dorsal ganglion (DR) neurons. Intra injection of LO selectively reduced activation of small-DR neurons, mostly nocice, to noxious stimulation plantarinc. HA/3 was purified from water-soluble extract human and biochemically functionally characterized using western blot and TR assays. HA/3 was biologically active with high amounts in human tissues. Like LO, intra injection of HA/3 dose-dependently induced antocice in WT and attenuated hypersensitivity developed hindp plantinc. HA/3-induced inhibition was comparable male and female plantinc. HM-HA, a component of HA/3, attenuates inflammatory and neuropathic pain induced chemotherapy paclaxel. Researchers examined HM-H on posturgical pain unknown. Compared efficacy HA3 and HM-H, both 20g weight HA/3 based on HM-H content. At peak 1 postdrug, HA3 demonstrated more potent anti-hyperges effect HM, persisted 4hr. In contrast, effect HM largely dissipated 4 mark. Treatment HM-H and HC, another component HA3, did not demonstrate greater painhib effect HM alone. Findings suggest full HA3 complex superior HM attenuating posturgical. Using in vivo imaging DR, intra injection LO reduced activation nocice in ganglia peripheral noxious, possibly inhibiting transduction signals nerve terminals alleviating posturgical pain. Due technical limitations in vivo imaging nerve skin, cultured DR neurons examined mechanisms signaling pathways involved inhibition LO.

This study investigated the relationship between the pigmentation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (iPSC-RPE) and their gene expression profiles. The researchers used the Automated Live and Picking System (ALPS) to photograph and pick single cells for RNA sequencing analysis. The results showed that the color of iP-R cells did not project specific gene profiles, and there was no correlation between color and gene expression. The study found that genes related to pigmentation had less correlation with color, suggesting that color is a temporal condition not indicating functional characteristics of RPE. RPE is a layer of hexagonal, brown-pigmented cells between the retina and choroid, playing a crucial role in visual maintenance by supplying photoreceptors, phagocytosing outer segments, visual cycle producing photosensitive vitamin A, and secreting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Abnormalities in R cause retinal degenerative diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Medication for AMD is limited, and attention is on cell transplantation of R for treatment. The study used iP-R cells produced from human iP lines and verified expressions of R65, Bestin, CRBP, and MERT by PCR, PAX and immunostaining, and PED and VEG by ELISA. The morphology and pigmentation were qualitatively checked but no means to link appearances with expression. The invention AL enabled characterization of cells showing behavior of interest, monitoring in live, and picking single for further manipulation. The system was used to monitor color iP-R cells, pick, followed by RNA sequencing to profile gene expression. The study concluded that color iP-R did not project specific gene profile, reasoned by analyzing correlation between color and expression. The found genes define pigmentation had less correlation with color, suggesting color is a temporal condition not representing function of R. The study analyzed the transcript of iP-R cells, calculating weighted sum of RGB, and used as proxy for pigmentation. Gene enrichment analysis identified 15 pathways in darker cells, including lysosome and complement-related. Lysosome genes PAS and CT correlated with color at 0.34 and 0.31, respectively. Complement genes C1, C, and C correlated with color at 0.31, 0.31, and 0.27, respectively. Gene related retin recycling showed weak correlation with color at 0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.11. The study showed degree of pigmentation in vitro iP-R cells did not project geneological clusters, correlated with some functional genes like complement and lysosome.
Researchers have developed a novel apparatus, Marmet Apparatus Automated Pulling (MoAAP), to study cooperative behaviors in common marmets (Callithrix jacus). The MoAAP addresses limitations of traditional research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses in naturalistic settings. The apparatus is designed to accommodate a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities, and provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations.

The study of animal behavior is essential for comprehending behavioral dynamics and underlying processes. Exploring neurobiological foundations of behavior enables identification of shared mechanisms governing decision, learning, memory, and problem-solving across the animal kingdom. However, investigations of neurobiology ecologically valid behaviors can be challenging using traditional approaches. With advancements in methods for recording and manipulating activity, there is a need to modernize approaches to studying behavior to keep pace with evolving techniques. The commonarmet (Callith jacus) has emerged as a valuable model in neuroscience due to its proximity to humans, prosocial nature, and small size, facilitating naturalistic studies.

Marmets are prosocial, socially tolerant primates, engaging in pair and cooperative breeding, which has been theorized to shape socio-cognitive abilities. They show socio-cognitively advanced behaviors such as social learning, communication, understanding of cues, and cooperative problem-solving relative to non-cooperatively breeding primates. Marmets share similarities with humans in neural circuits involved in cognition, including face-responsive regions in the temporal lobe and social brain networks. Marmets provide a unique opportunity to investigate behavioral dynamics, however, being a new model in the field, they benefit from extensive methodological developments for other organisms.

Advanced cognition demands flexibly constructing internal models of agents and computing layers of self and others. Cooperation, a key strategy in evolution, involves integrating information social relationships and goals of oneself and others. Studying behavior has implications for understanding dynamics, communication, and cognition in the kingdom. Researchers have traditionally used the cooperative paradigm, a setup requiring animals collaborate to manipulate a device and retrieve food. This involves working in tandem, each pulling one end of a looped rings attached to a heavy board on the ground. The paradigm has contributed to understanding cooperative abilities across species, including chimpanzees, capins, hyenas, wolves, dogs, elephants, otters, and rooks.

However, the paradigm presents limitations hindering utility for investigating complex dynamics and underlying mechanisms. Low resolution output variables measured, manual coding, and frequent experimenter intervention disrupt natural behaviors and limit trials. Researchers have explored alternative tasks, such as the nose-poking in mice, rats, and shrews. Mo aims to address these limitations by developing an automated cooperative task for marmets. The apparatus consists of levers controlled by a servo motor, integrated with sensors, and cameras, and microphones. Marmets are trained to pull levers in exchange for rewards, demonstrating acquisition of lever-pulling and cooperative behaviors. Three dyads of mets achieve proficiency in cooperative within 2 months, with an average of 33.7 days to reach 50 success. The automated paradigm enables 146 trials per 20 min, with 47.9 successful, compared to 10.4 in manual paradigms.

Mets exhibit rapid acquisition of lever-pulling and capacity for complex contingencies, such as cooperative. The apparatus provides millisecond timestamps for lever and rewards, enabling quantitative assessment of learning and performance. The study demonstrates a 15-fold increase in trials compared to conventional paradigms, critical for investigations of neural mechanisms. The ability to examine social interactions with high-through data is important for characterizing transgenic mets. The apparatus is adaptable, allowing
This study investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) on DNA methylation in offspring using a murine model. Moderate PA was sufficient to induce site-specific differences in DNA methylation in newborns without overt behavioral outcomes in adult mice. Global DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between PA and non-PA mice, but regional analysis showed widespread effects characterized by lower methylation with PA, mostly in non-coding regions of the genome. Methylation effects were tissue-specific, with only two genomic regions and genes similarly affected in both liver and brain. Most observed effects were tissue-specific, with perturbations in the epigenome observable in liver, which may reflect liver's role in metabolic detoxification or cell-type differences between brain and liver. DMRs were enriched in nonoding regions with regulatory potential, suggesting broad effects on genome regulation. Human studies replicated some disturbances in patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FAS). Associations in murine model were recapitulated in subjects with AS despite species and biosample differences, suggesting stable DNA changes over time. Notably, effect sizes replicated were smaller in blood from subjects with AS, suggesting dose and duration may exceed threshold to survive in blood. Candidate analysis replicated decreased methylation Peg and KvDM1 from African children with AS. Genes are methylated parent-of-specific, suggesting alcohol affects imprinting. Duration, dose, and tissue factors likely influence extent of regulation perturbation and methylation. Results encourage biomarker studies and prioritization for future follow-up, particularly in AS diagnosis. HMD mitigated some PA effects on methylation, consistent with preclinical choline supplementation rodent studies.
The study investigates the mechanisms of RNA interference (RNAi) in the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans, focusing on the intersecting network of regulators required for silencing somatic genes. RNAi is a conserved mechanism that triggers the degradation of mRNA matching sequences, leading to gene silencing. In C. elegans, dsRNA is imported through the transmembrane protein SID-1, processed by the endonuc DCR-1, and recognized by the primary Argute R-1. However, the silencing of different mRNAs diverges through the recruitment of different regulators. The study analyzes two genes, unc-22 and bli-1, which show stark differences in requirements for RNA factors silencing. Changing the 3cis-regulatory sequences of bli-1 makes its silencing largely independent of NR-3, indicating prior regulation dictates genetic requirements. Mutations in MUT-16, NR-3, and R-10 are required for unc-22 silencing, suggesting an intersecting network for all somatic genes. Intermediate steps require mRNA participation, such as production of 2 siRNAs, have complex dependencies making intermediates poor predictors of silencing. Subcell localization of mRNA and components of the RNA machinery are needed to test hypotheses. 22 RNAs are the most abundant, arising from amplification downstream exposure to ds and endogenous RNA. MUT-16 is thought to nucleate perin foci in the gerine, recruiting components R-2, MUT-7, MUT-14, MUT-15, NY-1, NY-2, R-8, R-3/MUT, and others. R-10 has a conserved Mael domain, shares homology with ERI-3-5 exonuclease, and mutation disrupts silencing dsRNA. R-10 interacts with Argute ER- and nucleases, trimming pre-22 RN to 22. The study proposes production of 22 RN in response to ds occurs: nonive RdPs making heterogenous RNAs, Argute binding 5 ends, and R-10/associated trimming excess 3 to generate 22- si retained by mature Argute complex. The study explores RNA response using single, equilibrium, and dynamic models, simulating protein factors, amplification, and gene silencing, and dependence of mRNA, preRNA, and intermediates. Simulations were conducted in R, Python, and Python, and R. The study introduces mutations in R-10, NR-3, ER-1, and 3cis-regulatory regions of bli- and unc-22, using CRISPR, and genotypes using PCR, restriction, and Sanger sequencing. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of RNAi mechanisms in C. elegans, highlighting the intersect network of regulators for silencing somatic genes.
This study aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) pathogenesis and mortality, using whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), and 30 healthy controls. Weighted gene co-expression analysis identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, CD, and 4) were strong predictors of three-month mortality, and a prognostic model combining these genes and clinical factors achieved good performance (AUC 0.80 and 0.86 for HIV-negative and HIV-positive, respectively). The study found similarities and differences in inflammatory responses between HIV-positive and HIV-negative TBM, which may explain different therapeutic effects of corticosteroid treatment. A four-gene host response in blood might represent a biomarker for those at risk of death, regardless of HIV status.

The study collected peripheral blood samples from 207 HIV-negative TBM, 74 HIV-positive TBM, 295 PT, and 30 healthy controls for transcriptomic profiling. RNA was isolated using PAX Blood kits and sequenced using NovaSeq 600 S reagents. Quality control and alignment were performed using in-house pipeline. Reads were aligned to human genome (GRCh38 build 99) and gene counts generated using FeatureCounts. Batch effect was removed using combat. WNA from Bioconductor package was used to construct co-expression network in discovery (n=142) and validation (n=139) datasets. Module preservation was used to assess reproducibility of modules between datasets. Modules associated with mortality were identified using Cox model with PC as independent variable, adjusted for age, HIV, and corticoster treatment. Hub genes within modules were identified based on protein function, module membership, and rank significance. Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) was used to determine biological processes related to modules. Pathway enrichment was calculated using ssSEA and QuAGE. Consensus WNA was performed to identify co-expression patterns between HIV and HIV-negative in TBM. Association analyses were conducted for T severity and mortality in WNA for both HIV-negative and HIV cohorts. Results were visualized using heatmap. Functional ORA was performed for consensus and HIV-specific modules. Top 5 genes from HIV-specific modules were selected based on criteria. Multivariate elastic Cox regression was used to select predictors for HIV-negative and HIV TBM. Predictors consisted of common genes, HIV-specific genes, and clinical biomarkers. Models were developed using logistic regression incorporating chosen variables for T cohort stratified by HIV-negative and HIV. Performance was assessed using bootstrapping approach.
A study was conducted to assess the performance of 614 commercially available antibodies targeting 65 human proteins in Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunofluorescence (IF) applications. The study aimed to determine the scope of the problem of antibodies not recognizing their intended targets and to develop a strategy for achieving at least one potent and specific antibody for each protein in the proteome. A partnership was formed with academics, funders, and manufacturers, including 10 companies representing 27% of global antibody production. Each protein was tested with antibodies from various manufacturers in parallel using standardized protocols. Approximately 50% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and 50% by at least high-performing renewable. Recombinant antibodies performed better than polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies in all applications. The study found that 20-30% of figures in literature use antibodies that do not recognize their target, suggesting effort in characterization is justified. A resource was assigned to each antibody, and data are disseminated through the RR portal and participating manufacturers' websites. The study provides an unbiased framework for representation and comparison of antibody performance, estimate of coverage of proteins with renewables, assessment of characterization methods, and strategy to identify renewables for all proteins.
Researchers at the Transgenic RNA Project (TRP) have developed a set of tools to facilitate combinatorial studies by generating reagents that can be used alongside GAL4/UAS in various Drosophila tissues. They focused on genes with well-characterized GAL expression patterns, targeting 23 genes to produce 44 highly tissue-specific LexAAD and Q2 driver lines by CRPR homology-directed repair. The Lex system was used with the GAL activation domain to allow temporal control by temperature-sensitive GAL repressor GAL80, and Q2 variant to avoid toxicity. Each knock was rigorously genotyped and expression verified by imaging. New vectors and protocols were created to generate Lex-G and Q drivers, including constructs that encode Q2 and Lex-G transcription factors in a single vector, with FRT sites. Successful integration into the genome generates a driver that expresses both Q2 and Lex-G, which can be excised with Flp to obtain individual drivers. Both Q2 and Lex-G systems were evaluated for in vivo knockdown and generating a library of shRNA fly lines as a community resource. The Lex and Q systems will provide new tools for researchers to activate or repress different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

The TRP generated pH-TA-LAex-Q2-H70x3P-R plasmids by replacing SV-3'UT with h70-3'UT in pCRPaint-TA-LA-Q2 and removing endogenous SacI sites in Q2 coding. HAs were amplified by ~100 kb upstream and downstream of guide site using Gibson assembly. Guide RNAs were cloned in pD with sense and antisense oligos annealed and ligated into B-digested pD. The drop method used homology intermediate vectors with gene-specific sequence, 200 short H, and BIs and Sac cloning. pH-TA-Q2-H70x3P-R plasm digested with Asc/Sac and ligated with digested UC Kanw2 backbone containing H and guides. Combined Lex-G and Q transcription vectors were built, a CRPR version to insert into endogenous locus and ϕ31-B to clone enhancer of interest. pH-Q2-Lex-G-XP-R was assembled with CRPaint-Q2 and CRPaint-Lex-G, and pCS-TA-Q2-Lex-G-WUM for dpp and Il2 enhancers.

CRIS constructs were injected 250 ng/μl with 100 ng/μ gRNA into embryos. Knock efficiencies were comparable to previous reports. Resulting G males and females were crossed to balancer for 3FP screening. Positive lines were balanced and established. phi31-integration plasm was injected 50 ngμ into v-phi31;P for chromosome 2 or v-31;P for 3. Injected males were crossed w;Cy or w/T3 to identify transformants and remove integrase. Primers flanked site were designed for each gene and used with primers within cassette in both orientations. 500-800 amplicons were amplified from DNA individual lines through PCR. Transgenic stocks will be available at BD.

T-Lex-G, T-Q2, or double lines were crossed to w;Lex-GFP, wQU-GFP/Cy, or wQU-G/Cy-GFP. Larvae were placed in PBS and live-imaged. Wing discs were dissected, fixed, permeabilized, mounted, and imaged on Zeiss confocal microscope.
The study investigates the role of the transcription factor B11 (B11) in regulating the structure and function of mossy fiber synapses (MFS) in the adult mouse hippocampus. B11 is a zinc finger protein that has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Conditional ablation of B11 in the adult hippocampus results in impaired learning and memory. The study shows that B11 regulates the organization of FS by controlling the recruitment of synaptic vesicles (SV) to the active zone (AZ) through a direct interaction with the synaptic adhesion molecule neurexin3 (Nrx3) containing the splice site 25 sequence (SSb). This interaction is essential for SV recruitment and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the FS. The study demonstrates that B11, through its transcriptional target Cql2, modulates the organization of FS by controlling SV recruitment to the AZ. Cql is a synaptic organizer that has been implicated in schizophrenia and addiction. The study shows that Cql is necessary for SV recruitment and LTP at FS, and that its interaction with N3 is essential for SV recruitment. The study also shows that the K262 mutation in Cql, which disrupts interaction with N3, rescues LTP but not SV recruitment. The study suggests that B11 regulates FS through Cql-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that Cql is necessary for SV and LTP. The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction.
The study investigates the function of the zinc-finger protein S1 (S1) in regulating gene expression in yeast. S1 is known to bind to promoters and regulate transcription, but its role in post-transcriptional regulation is unclear. The study shows that S1 binds to nascent transcripts and stabilizes them, affecting their deadenylation and decay. S1's binding to nascent RNA is dependent on Rap1, a protein that recruits S1 to the promoter. S1's binding to nas RNA is also dependent on the GCT motif, a sequence found in some promoters. The study finds that S1 binds to a subset of mRNAs, specifically those that are transcribed by S1, and stabilizes them. S's effect on transcription is linked to its effect on mRNA stability, suggesting a connection between the two processes. The study also shows that S's effect on elongation is linked to its effect on mRNA stability, suggesting a connection between the two processes. S has two zinc fingers, characteristic of TFs that bind DNA, RNA, and protein. The study proposes S as an example of a factor that regulates both transcription and postcription. S's effect on elongation is linked to its effect on mRNA stability, suggesting a connection between the two processes. The study shows S's effect on elongation is linked to its effect on mRNA, suggesting a connection between the two. The study proposes S as an example of a factor that regulates both transcription and postcription. S's effect on elong is linked to its effect on mRNA, suggesting a connection between the two.

This study investigated the connection between programmed cell death during plant development (PCD) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SOMERO (SMB) and senescence-associated nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization along the entire root, suggesting that uncle cell corpses surrounding smb-roots provide additional nutrients fueling fungal colonization. Inoculation of smb- mutants showed a clearing effect with progressive stages. Hypercolonization of Arabid by loss of PC in the cap mitigated the effects of S indica by delaying growth promotion. Notably, hypercolonization of the merist zone smb mutants. The apical meristem in this zone is essential for root growth, as primary tissue originates from continuously dividing cells. The sensitive is surrounded by the cap, which protects from external stresses. Phenotype smb mutants resemble human disease hyperkeratosis. Healthy skin a pool stem produces layers that divide, differentiate, die, and shed. Such programs form a physical barrier against environmental microbes attempting to establish are removed by exfoliation. Patients with hyperat show accumulation of cells on the outer layer, making susceptible to infection. Importance of intact cap in plant-micro interactions highlighted by removal of caps in maize leads to colonization of the tip by growth rhobacter Pseudomonas fluoresens and changes in rhosphere composition along axis. Results provide evidence that cap maintenance in form constant cell turnover acts as a barrier, analogous to epidermal turnover in animals, preventing intracellular colonization near merist tissue and contributing to beneficial interaction with endophy. Mutation B1 displayed increased colonization in differentiation but not merematic zone. Differences in colonization smb mutants reflect spatial and patterns SMB and B1 activity throughout Arab roots. SMB restricted to L, B1 expressed in tissues undergoing PC and senesc above ground. Showed B1 in differentiated epider cells undergoing degradation during maturation, age-dependent PC in outer layer contributing clearance corpses during emergence. Process resembles cortical senesc and death in grasses, typically in epmis toward endoderm. Observed distinct protein in smb and b1 mutants. smb restricted to L cells adhering primary, attributed absence SMB proteases in L cells. Absence impairs turnover, leading accumulation specifically. In contrast, b1 mutation diffuse in epider layer, regardless death. Widespread suggests B1 in maintaining homeost and protein control throughout epider and zone. Contrasting phenotypes highlight distinct roles in processes. Show PC protects mer from microbial, propose adapted microbes manipulate processes affecting transcription B1 to accommodation. Whether interference by effector, fungal-derived or systemic roots remains investigated.
This study investigates the role of mechanical force in the production of extracellular vesicles (exophers) in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode model organism. Researchers found that exoph production peaks at adult day 2, coinciding with the reproductive peak, and is associated with the presence of fertilized eggs in the uterus. Disruption of germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/embryos suppresses ex production, while restoring egg production through mating or inducing egg retention increases it. Genetic interventions that promote ex production are associated with longer uter lengths, while those that suppress it are associated with shorter uter lengths. Fertilized eggs are necessary for the early elevation of ex production, and their presence is sufficient to drive it, even in the absence of egg-laying. Expansion of the uterus with unfertil oocytes also elevates ex production. The study suggests that the filled uterus, under normal conditions of hard-shelled eggs, is sensed and required for the early peak ex production. Mechanotransduction, the sensing of mechanical signals such as pressure or stretch, and conversion into cellular response, is proposed. Classic mechanosensors like Piezo, TR, and DE/ENC families are candidates, but may not best-suited for sustained forces. Adhesion-Pro Coupled Receptors, with extracellular adhesion and seven-transmembrane domains, could integrate forces via cytoskeleton. Determination of mechanotrans and site of action remains future studies. The study reveals capacity of force to influence neuronal release of vesicles containing neuroto species, inviting consideration of mechanology in proteasis and aggregate within the nervous system.
This study investigates the role of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synapse loss and cognitive decline. DKK is a secreted protein that antagonizes the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in synapse formation, plasticity, and integrity. Previous studies suggest W signaling is compromised in AD, contributing to syn degeneration. DKK is upregulated in the brains of AD patients and mouse models, and is present in amyloid plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of AD. The study aims to investigate DKK's role in synapse and memory in healthy and AD brains, using human samples and mouse models. DKK is upregulated in AD brains, starting from early stages, with increased protein levels in Bra I-III subjects and asymptomatic cases. This is consistent with proteomic studies showing elevated DKK in brain areas, including hippocampus and synosomes of AD patients. DKK accumulates in amyloid plaques in two mouse models, NL and J, and is localized to axonal spher, colocalizing with LAMP. Extracellular DKK levels are elevated in brain slices before amyloid burden, while exposure to Aβ increases total and extracellular DKK in neurons. Blocking N-methyl-aspartate receptors (NAR) abolishes extracellular DKK, suggesting overactivation of NAR triggers D release. DKK differentially regulates excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, decreasing excitatory syn and increasing inhibitory syn. In vivo, downregulation of DKK ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory syn defects in J mice, supporting DKK's role in AD. DKK is a potential target for ameliorating excitatory inhibitory syn and memory impairment in AD.
The study investigates the antibacterial properties of pyoverines, a class of siderophores produced by non-pathogenic Pseudomonas species, against human opportunistic pathogens. A collection of 320 Pseudas isolates from soil and water samples were screened for pyoverine production and siderophore activity against 12 opportunistic human pathogens. Seven supernatants inhibited all 12 pathogens, and pyines were extracted and elucidated using UPL-HC-HMS/MS. Chemical properties of pyines were analyzed, including polarity, collision cross-section (CCS), and collision-induced unfolding (CI) stability. Inhibitory pyines were distinguished from non-inhibitory pyines by higher CCS and CI stability. The most potent pyines were purified and tested against A. baumann, K. pneumonia, P. aerugin, and S. aureus in vitro and in G. mellella larvae. In vitro, pyines were effective against A. baumann and S. aure, but less effective against K. pneumonia and P. aerugin. In vivo, py were effective against A. ba and K pneumonia, but not P. aerugin. Evolution experiments showed low resistance to pyines in A. ba and K, but not in P and S. aure. Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed mutations in regulatory, biofilm, and motility, and metabolic genes. The study suggests pyines as a new class of antibacterials against opportunistic pathogens, with low toxicity and potential for resistance.
The study investigates the relationship between NMDA receptor (NMDAR) synaptic function and spiking dynamics in prefrontal cortex (PFC) networks, particularly in the context of schizophrenia (SZ). The authors use a spiking network model to explain the emergence of 0-l synchronous spiking between prefront neurons and the failure of synchronous spiking when NAR currents are reduced. The model consists of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic synaptic conductance-based synapses, connected randomly with a probability p=0.2. Each neuron receives excitatory and inhibitory connections, as well as external inputs from outside the network. Synaptic currents are mediated by AMPA, NMD, and GABA receptors, with voltage-dependent NAR conductance. The authors use mean-field analysis to derive equations for population firing rates and synaptic conductance, and linearize around the critical point corresponding to the onset of oscillatory instability. They find that the rate of oscillatory growth λ depends on AMP conduct, NAR, and GAB synaptic conduct, as well as external rate. In the vicinity of the critical point, λ is approximated by ΛPAΔgPA+ΛNΔNΔN+ΛGΔG, where ΛPA, N, and G are constants. The study shows that AMP conduct has a dominant effect on λ, while NAR and GAB have smaller effects. The model explains the emergence of 0 synchronous spiking when external inputs push the network across the critical boundary and the failure of synchronous spiking when NAR currents are reduced, consistent with neural recordings in SZ. The authors also investigate how synaptic conduct and rate affect synchrony, linearizing the mean equations around the critical point. They find that λ depends on AMP, N, and G synaptic conduct, as well as external rate, with AMP having a dominant effect. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between NAR function and spiking in SZ, shedding light on the role of NAR in SZ pathophysiology.
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in adult endothelium. Proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEF), specify endothelial lining blood vessels into diverse phenotypes, including proigratory Tip cells. Tip cells initiate cell migration into surrounding matrix, leading to sprouting and branching of nascent vessels. Tip cells are differentiated from Stalk cells through juxtine cell-cell interaction involving NOTCH signaling, modulated by Dll and Jag ligands. St cells can form in proximity of Tip, particularly at leading edge of extending spr, if NOT signaling is pronounced for Tip-St differentiation to occur. Prolation of St cells is essential for emergence and extension of sprouts, making analysis of Tip-St specification important. Proangi factors, such as VEG, promote Tip fate, while NOT signaling by neighboring cells promotes St fate, suppressing Tip identity in same cell. These inputs can result in complex outcomes poorly understood. Elucidation of these processes requires high-resolution measurements coupled with analysis. Since measurements challenging in vivo, especially in mammalian tissues, use of models recapitulating salient vasculature is key in analysis of angiogenesis and development de novo beds. A microfabricated angiogenesis models have improved biomimetic characteristics, spatially and biochemically appropriate microenvironments, composed of ECM and growth factors around developing vascul, composed endothelial and pericytes. These models have been used to map combinations VEG and inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TN), pro- and antiangi outcomes, encountered angi conditions. Analysis provided evidence'mini-spr' structures, one-cell protruding parental vessel into matrix, comprised Tip cells. However, it unclear whether these'mini' would develop into multicellular sprouts with lumens and form blood vessels. Further, analysis was needed to account spatial aspects Tip and spr specification, such as mutual distance and density. To address these challenges, experimental and mathematical models of angiogenesis were combined. A 3D angiogenesis model was used, consisting of polydimethylsilane (PD) chamber, engineered vessel in collagen, and construct placed on glass dish. Endothelial cells were injected into channel, allowed to attach, and form confluent monolayer. Proangi factors were added to induce angiogenesis. A mathematical model of interconnected NOT and VEG pathways was generalized to 2D multicellular scenario. Temporal dynamics of NOT, Delta, Jag, NOT intracellular domain NIC, and VEG receptor were modeled with ordinary equations. NOT, Delta, Jag, and VEG produced with basal rates, degraded with constant. Production modulated NIC transcriptionally activates NOT, Jag, inhibits Delta, VEG via Hill functions. Receptors and ligands bind with rate. NOT, Delta, Jag, and VEG bind external with rate. NIC released upon binding, degraded. VEG receptors bind V ligands, creating VR, inhibiting Delta production. Parameters were rescaled to match ratio Tip-St cells between model and experiment. Results showed regulation of VEG on NOT-Delta pathway. NOT-Jagged interaction suppressed Tip-St differentiation, leading hybrid-St phenotype. Tip cells defined as high-Delta, low-NOT cells. Results calculated on 30x30 hexagonal lattice with periodic conditions. Initially, lattice prepared with randomized conditions, equilibrated 100 hr without VEG. Fluorescence images were used to quantify Tip-Tip distance. Images were preprocessed to clean 3D, separate vessels from parental, labeled colors, and nuclei detected. Nuclei on parental marked Stalk, in spr or mini-pr surfaces marked Tips. Nuclei St on spr or mini-pr surfaces re-labeled if connected to spr or mini-pr. Nuclei spr or mini-pr not in parental, closest to vessel labeled spr or mini, others deleted. Distance between Tips number cells
This study investigated the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) in learning and memory, specifically its interaction with the hippocampus, using a fear conditioning paradigm. The LC is a brain region involved in arousal, attention, and emotional processing, and is known to modulate neural activity through the release of norepinephrine and dopamine. The researchers used optogenetics and photometry to examine LC activity and its projections to the hippocampus during fear conditioning. They found that the LC responds to both neutral and aversive stimuli, with responses modulated by intensity and valence. LC responses habituated to repeated exposure to a neutral stimulus, but increased when associated with an aversive outcome. Direct projections from LC to the hippocampus exhibited phasic responses to learning-relevant stimuli during conditioning. LC stimulation increased dopamine and norephrine in the hippocampus, with dopamine required for fear memory formation. The study suggests LC enhances memory through plasticity and cognitive function, with dopamine release from LC terminals in the hippocampus contributing to its effects. The findings have implications for understanding LC's role in learning and memory, and its interaction with the hippocampus.
