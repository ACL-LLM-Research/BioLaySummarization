    Title: 
    Article: Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication, known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’ ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses. 
 Synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts where two neurons can share relevant functional information. The exchange of information can occur directly through cell–cell channels, known as ‘electrical synapses’, or indirectly, via the release of a chemical messenger, known as ‘chemical synapses’ ( Pereda, 2014 ). While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses with structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components has long been recognized ( Wichmann and Kuner, 2022; Wilhelm et al., 2014 ), less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as ‘gap junctions’ ( GJs ) ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 ). These structures contain intercellular channels formed by the apposition of two hemichannels, each provided by one of the connected cells, and which cluster together into GJ ‘plaques’ ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 ). Hemichannels are formed by proteins called ‘connexins’ ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009; Söhl and Willecke, 2004 ) in vertebrates and ‘innexins’ ( Phelan et al., 1998; Phelan, 2005 ) in invertebrates that, though unrelated in sequence, share a similar membrane topology that allows them to assemble into intercellular channels. While GJs are ubiquitous and present in virtually every tissue of the organism providing metabolic coupling ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 ), they additionally serve as a pathway of low resistance for the spread of electrical currents between neurons ( and cells of the heart ), the main form of signaling in the brain, which is fast enough to operate within the time frame required for decision-making by neural circuits ( Bennett, 1997; Alcamí and Pereda, 2019 ). Electrical synapses are generally perceived as structurally simpler than chemical synapses and exclusively involving the function of intercellular channels. However, recent data indicates that the function of these channels is under the control of their supporting molecular scaffold ( Flores et al., 2008; Lasseigne et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2023 ), suggesting that neuronal GJs are complex molecular structures whose function requires the contribution of multiple molecular components ( Miller and Pereda, 2017 ). Such molecular complexity is likely to underlie plastic changes in the strength of electrical synapses ( Pereda et al., 2013; O’Brien and Bloomfield, 2018 ), which are capable of dynamically reconfiguring neural circuits ( O’Brien and Bloomfield, 2018; Bloomfield and Völgyi, 2009 ). Thus far, investigations of the properties of vertebrate electrical transmission have solely considered the functional properties of the channel-forming proteins, the connexins, the molecules that regulate them, and their interactions at the GJ plaque. However, could a single neuronal GJ per se be considered an electrical synapse? Alternatively, does electrical transmission rely on additional structural components? The identification of the structural components of a chemical synapse is facilitated by the presynaptic bouton, which anatomically defines its limit ( Sotelo, 2020 ). In contrast, neuronal GJs are typically found connecting cell somata or other neuronal processes ( Alcamí and Pereda, 2019; Sotelo, 2020; Sotelo and Llinás, 1972 ), such as dendrites and axons, making it more difficult to define the exact anatomical boundaries that constitute an electrical synapse. Neuronal GJs can also occur at synaptic boutons, generally coexisting with specializations for chemical transmission ( Sotelo, 2020; Martin and Pilar, 1963 ). This is the case for auditory afferents terminating as single ‘large myelinated club endings’ ( Bartelmez, 1915; Bartelmez and Hoerr, 1933 ) or ‘club endings’ ( CEs ) on the lateral dendrite of the teleost Mauthner cells ( a pair of large reticulospinal neurons involved in tail-flip escape responses in fish ) ( Pereda and Faber, 2011; Faber and Pereda, 2011 ), each containing GJs and specializations for chemical transmission ( Robertson et al., 1963 ). Because of their experimental accessibly and functional properties, these terminals are considered a valuable model to study vertebrate electrical transmission as they more easily allow for the correlation between structure and function of synaptic features ( Pereda et al., 2013; Robertson et al., 1963; Furshpan, 1964; Flores et al., 2012 ). Since the bouton marks the anatomical limits of a synapse, these contacts offer the opportunity to examine the anatomical structures that together make an electrical synapse. Here, we used expansion microscopy ( Tillberg et al., 2016 ) to expose the presence and spatial arrangement of synaptic components in CEs of larval zebrafish. CEs from larval zebrafish share comparable morphological and functional properties with those of adult fish ( Lasseigne et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2017; Echeverry et al., 2022 ), and due to their genetic accessibility, allow for the opportunity to investigate the functional link between the structures enabling electrical transmission and its regulation. Expansion revealed the presence of multiple well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact area, which, consistent with the notion that they represent GJ plaques, each exhibited labeling for the fish homologs of the widespread mammalian connexin 36 ( Cx36 ), Cx35, and Cx34, as well as for the GJ scaffolding protein zonula occludens ( ZO1 ) ( Flores et al., 2008; Lasseigne et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2017; Rash et al., 2013 ). Strikingly, expansion following staining with N-cadherin and ß-catenin antibodies, protein components of ‘adherens junctions’ ( AJs ), showed that these proteins are also distributed all throughout the contact area, but in a fashion that is mutually exclusive with connexin. This suggests that the subsynaptic topography of electrical synapses is carefully and intimately coordinated. Finally, double labeling with Cx and glutamate receptor antibodies showed that, while GJs are distributed throughout the entire contact area, a much smaller number of glutamatergic sites are restricted to the periphery occupying a small fraction ( ~19% ) of the contact’s surface. Thus, our data suggest that synaptic communication at electrical synapses results from not one but the coordinated action of multiple GJs of variable size, which may require the functional contribution of additional structures, such as AJs. 
 A group of auditory afferents, each of which terminate as a single synaptic contact, known as a club ending ( CE ), on the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner ( M- ) cell ( Bartelmez, 1915; Bartelmez and Hoerr, 1933; Figure 1A ). Because of their unusual large size and experimental accessibility, CEs represent a valued model for the correlation of synaptic structure and function. Ultrastructural analysis of CEs in adult goldfish ( Robertson et al., 1963; Tuttle et al., 1986; Kohno and Noguchi, 1986 ) and larval zebrafish ( Yao et al., 2014 ) revealed the presence of GJs and specializations for chemical transmission ( Pereda and Faber,201; Fab and Pereda,201 ). In larval zebish CEs were examined using expansion microscopy ( Tillberg et al,2016 ) to expose the presence and spatial distribution of synaptic components ( Figure 2 ). Expansion revealed the presence of multiple well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact, consistent with the notion that they represent G plaques, each labeling the homologs of mammalian connexin 36 ( C36 ), C35, and C34 as well as the G scaffolding protein zula occludens ( Z1 ) ( Flores et al,2008; Ligne et al,202; Miller et al,2017; Rash et,2013 ). Strikingly, expansion staining with N-caten and ß-caten antibodies, components of adherens junctions ( A ) showed that these proteins are distributed throughout the contact but in a fashion mutually exclusive with connin. This suggests that subsynaptic topography of electrical syn is carefully coordinated. Finally, double labeling with C and glutamate antibodies showed that while GJs are distributed the entire area a smaller glutamateric sites restricted the periphery occupying fraction ~19 of contact’s surface. Thus, our data suggest synaptic at electrical syn results not but coordinated action multiple G of variable size which may require contribution additional structures such as A.

    Title: 
    Article: The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ), a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases. 
 Breathing is a complex behavior requiring the coordination of multiple motor patterns in the face, upper airways, thorax, and abdomen to enable gas exchange between the external and internal environment and maintenance of blood gas homeostasis ( Del Negro et al., 2018 ). Strict coordination of breathing with the activity of facial and upper airway muscles underlies the rhythmic orofacial behaviors, such as sniffing, sucking, licking, whisking, vocalization, and swallowing, which are fundamental for ingestive and exploratory behavior, and social interaction ( Deschênes et al., 2016; Deschênes et al., 2015; Huff et al., 2022; Moore et al., 2014; Takatoh et al., 2022 ). Breathing-related information permeates the brain with respiratory modulation of suprapontine brain structures affecting cognitive function and emotional expression ( Ashhad et al., 2022; Lavretsky and Feldman PhD, 2021; Yackle et al., 2017 ). Similarly, coordination of this motor activity with autonomic nervous system activity produces phasic fluctuations of blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) that are essential for optimizing cardiac efficiency and organ blood flow ( Fisher et al., 2022; Menuet et al., 2020; O’Callaghan et al., 2020; Shanks et al., 2022 ). The network of neurons coordinating breathing is distributed throughout the brainstem, with a major group responsible for generating inspiration located in the pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) within the ventrolateral medulla oblongata ( Smith et al., 1991 ). In rodents, the preBötC consists of a heterogeneous population of ~3000 neurons with distinct, but intermingled, excitatory and inhibitory subgroups ( Ashhad and Feldman, 2020; Del Negro et al., 2018 ). Anatomical studies showed that preBötC sends parallel excitatory and inhibitory projections to target nuclei throughout the brain, including to regions responsible for respiratory motor activity ( Yang and Feldman, 2018 ). As indicated by their extensive projections, preBötC neurons modulate many circuits in addition to those required for breathing activity. For example, preBötC neurons project monosynaptically to key medullary centers for autonomic regulation, and modulate cardiorespiratory coupling ( Dempsey et al., 2017; Menuet et al., 2020; Menuet et al., 2017 ). Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea, but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity, reduces respiratory modulation of BP, and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia ( Menuet et al., 2020 ). Neurons in the preBötC also modulate orofacial behaviors. Activation of the developing brain homeobox1 ( Dbx1 ) -expressing preBötC neurons alters the networks responsible for the coordination of upper airways and swallowing, to decrease the probability of swallowing during inspiration ( Huff et al., 2022 ). The preBötC also contributes to motor patterns that are necessary for exploratory behaviors, such as sniffing and whisking. In this case, a group of inhibitory preBötC neurons provide monosynaptic inputs onto the vibrissal premotor neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus ( vIRt ) to facilitate synchronous whisking. In addition, preBötC contains facial premotor neurons that modulate nasal dilation and mystacial pad ( MP ) muscle activity to couple whisking to the breathing rhythm ( Deschênes et al., 2016; Takatoh et al., 2022 ). Understanding and identifying the preBötC subgroups that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors has been associated with the development and progression of diseases ( El-Omar et al., 2001; Huff et al., 2022; Menuet et al., 2017; Simms et al., 2009 ). Although several studies have attempted to understand the physiological function/s of each preBötC neuronal subpopulation, disturbances in breathing, that occur when preBötC neurons are either inhibited or activated, impact our understanding of whether the observed changes are due to the direct effects of preBötC neurons or alterations resulting from changes in the respiratory rhythm and blood gases ( Cui et al., 2016; Huff et al., 2022; Menuet et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2008; Yackle et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, whilst substantial gains have been made in understanding the expression of selective molecular markers in subgroups of preBötC neurons, it is rarely possible to reliably assign particular neurochemical signatures to unique functions ( Ashhad and Feldman, 2020; Del Negro et al., 2018; Yackle et al., 2017 ). For example, while Dbx1+somatostatin ( SST ) + predominantly affect the breathing pattern ( Cui et al., 2016; Del Negro et al., 2018; Ashhad and Feldman, 2020 ), some Dbx1+SST+ which also express the neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK1R ) and, in some cases, cadherin-9 ( Cdh9+ ), promote generalized behavioral arousal ( Yackle et al., 2017 ). To further understand the organization of the preBötC, in this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the preBötC region is composed of segregated subgroups of output neurons, potentially driven by a separate group of rhythmogenic neurons, that modulate specific behaviors, such as orofacial muscle activity. If correct, we predict that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus ( 7n ) should modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing cre-recombinase ( Cre ) -dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel, GtACR2, and another retrograde axonal delivery of Cre. We showed that selective transduction and photoinhibition of preBötC facial premotor neurons affects the MP activity while minimally affecting breathing. 
 To evaluate whether distinct subgroups of preBötC neurons could be distinguished based on their axonal projections, retrograde adeno-associated viruses ( AAVrg ), expressing either green fluorescent protein ( GFP ), or the red fluorophore, mCherry, were injected into 7n and the rostral ventrolateral medulla ( RVLM ) ( n=3 ), respectively ( Figure 1A ). Three weeks later, fluorophore expression was observed in preBötC neurons, with overlapping distribution ( Figure 1B ), albeit with the RVLM projecting cells tending to be more medial. Most cells only contained a single fluorophore, but a small number of double-labeled neurons were also identified ( Figure 1C ). The injection sites were also confirmed by local transduction into the 7n ( Figure 1D ) and RVLM ( Figure 1E ). These results provide confidence that subgroups of preBötC neurons can be transduced based on their anatomical connection. To modulate the activity of selectively transduced neurons, we generated an adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) which enabled Cre-dependent ( DIO ) expression, under the control of the ubiquitous chicken β-actin/cytomegalovirus ( CAG ) promoter, of the light-activated chloride channel, GtACR2, fused to a portion of Kv2. 1 to promote predominant somatic targeting ( Lim et al., 2000 ), and an enhanced GFP ( MuGFP; Scott et al., 2018 ) ; hereafter called AAV-DIO-GFP. AAV-DIO-G was injected into 7 and RVLM ( Figure 2A ). Three weeks later, photoinhibition of preöt neurons projecting to 7 was performed using a 473 nm laser ( Figure 2B ). Photoin of preöt neurons projecting to 7 resulted in a significant reduction of MP activity ( Figure 2C ) with minimal effect on breathing ( Figure 2D ). Photoin of pre neurons projecting to RVLM resulted in a significant reduction of breathing ( Figure 2E ) with minimal effect on MP ( Figure 2 ). These results indicate that preöt projecting to 7 modulate oracial activity with minimal impact on breathing, while preöt to RVLM modulate breathing with minimal effect on oracial activity. To determine whether preöt subgroups could be distinguished based on their axonal projections, we used AAV expressing either GFP or mCherry in 7 and RVLM ( n=3 ). Three weeks later, fluoroph expression was observed in preöt neurons with overlapping distribution ( Figure 3 ), with RV projecting cells tending to be more medial. Most cells contained a single fluoroph, but a number of double-labeled neurons were identified ( Figure 3 ). Injection sites were confirmed by transduction into 7 ( Figure 3 ) and RV ( Figure 3 ). These results provide confidence that preöt subgroups can be distinguished based on anatomical connection. To modulate activity of selectively transduced neurons, we generated AAV enabling Cre-dependent DIO expression under CAG promoter of GAC2 fused to portion Kv2.1 to promote somatic targeting ( Lim et al,200 ) and enhanced GFP ( MuFP; Scott et al,201 ) here called AAV-DIO. A-D was injected into 7 and RV ( Figure 4 ) Three weeks, photoin of preöt projecting 7 was performed using 473 nm ( Figure 4 ) Phot of preöt projecting 7 resulted in significant reduction MP ( Figure 4 ) with minimal breathing ( Figure 4 ) Phot of pre projecting RV resulted in significant breathing ( Figure 4 ) with minimal MP ( Figure ) These indicate pre projecting 7 modulate oracial with minimal breathing while pre RV modulate breathing minimal oracial. 
The results of this study demonstrate that preöt projecting to 7 modulate oracial activity with minimal impact on breathing, while pre to RV modulate breathing with minimal oracial activity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that preöt is composed of subgroups of output neurons driven by separate rhythmogenic neurons that modulate specific behaviors, such as orof muscle activity. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with motor and physiological behaviors, given that abnormal modulation of autonomic and oracial activity has been associated with development and progression of diseases.

    Title: 
    Article: Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. 
 Effective survival necessitates a repertoire of dynamic defensive behaviors, encompassing both passive and active responses. Passive defensive strategies, such as freezing, help avoid detection from predators by reducing motion ( Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969a; Fanselow, 1980; Fanselow, 1982 ). In contrast, active defensive behaviors, including fleeing or fighting, enable animals to swiftly escape or confront imminent threats ( Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969b; Bolles, 1970 ). The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active defenses in response to varying threat contexts is essential for optimizing survival outcomes, as demonstrated by studies utilizing naturalistic threat stimuli like predator-like robots or looming disks, which allowed the observation of various critical defensive behaviors ( Choi and Kim, 2010; Kang et al., 2022; Pyeon et al., 2023; Telensky et al., 2011 ). A critical component of this adaptive response is the general alarm signal, which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting appropriate defensive behaviors in the face of threats. These signals help organisms quickly recognize and respond to potential threats. The mechanisms underlying these alarm signals can be studied through Pavlovian fear conditioning ( Bolles and Collier, 1976; Fanselow and Poulos, 2005; LeDoux, 2000; Maren, 2001 ). In this process, a neutral sensory stimulus ( conditioned stimulus or CS ) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ), leading to a conditioned response ( CR ) that can be expressed as either freezing or fleeing, depending on the specific features of the CS ( Borkar and Fadok, 2021; Fadok et al., 2017 ) and US ( Lee et al., 2018; Pyeon et al., 2023 ). Neurons within the PBN that express CGRP have been suggested to function as general alarm signals in the brain ( Palmiter, 2018 ). These neurons respond to noxious stimuli of diverse sensory modalities ( Campos et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2022 ) and transmit interoceptive and exteroceptive information to the forebrain ( Bernard and Besson, 1988; Chiang et al., 2019 ). Additionally, these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock ( Han et al., 2015 ). Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior, demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories ( Bowen et al., 2020; Han et al., 2015 ). However, for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system, they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors, whether passive or active. While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established, their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored. To address this, we employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals, thereby incorporating an imminent threat. We hypothesized that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat. We first recorded CGRP neuron activity in response to various aversive stimuli including the robot chasing to determine whether they encode noxious stimuli differentially. We then manipulated CGRP activity—both activating and inactivating—during fear conditioning with robot chasing and footshock. Our results suggest that manipulation of CGRP neurons bidirectionally modulates conditioned fleeing behaviors through altering the perception of the threat. These results highlight the role of CGRP neurons as a general alarm signal, primarily facilitating passive defensive behaviors, while also engaging in active defensive behaviors in response to high-threat conditions. 
 The response profiles of CGRP neurons in conventional fear conditioning with footshock have been well-reported ( Han et al., 2015 ). However, how CGRP neurons respond to chasing threats has not been established. To investigate the activity of CGRP neurons in response to robot chasing, in vivo recordings using the optical-tagging strategy were performed ( Jo et al., 2018; Juarez et al., 2023 ). Heterozygous mice expressing Cre-recombinase at the Calca locus ( CalcaCre/+ ) were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) carrying an excitatory channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) with red fluorescent protein ( AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet ). Then, a movable optrode array containing one optic fiber with four tetrodes was implanted over the PBN ( Figure 1A ). After 2 wk of recovery, neuronal activity was recorded during fear conditioning with a robot over three consecutive days ( Figure 1B ). Animals were first habituated to a tone ( 4 kHz; 70 dB; 10 s ) as a CS in a rectangular box. The following day, the animals were placed in a donut-shaped maze and presented with the CS 10 times, each paired with an US of being chased by the robot at a speed of 70 cm/s for 3 s. When animals collided with the robot, it pushed them forward, increasing their fleeing speed ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ). If an animal blocked its path, the robot continued to push it, but its speed decreased due to friction and reduced motor power, ensuring it did not run over the animal. On day 3, fear memory was assessed by presenting the CS alone 10 times in the same context as the habituation session. In this behavioral paradigm, animals engaged in both passive and active defensive strategies, as evidenced by freezing and flight responses during conditioning ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ). Passive behavior was measured by freezing, defined as the absence of movement, while active behavior was represented by flight, quantified with a flight score calculated by dividing the average velocity during the CS by the average velocity during the pre-CS period ( Borkar et al., 2024; Fadok et al., 2017 ). While both responses were observed during conditioning, the test day, conducted without the robot, showed increased freezing and reduced fleeing responses ( Figure 1C and D ). To identify CGRP neurons, 10 pulses of blue light ( 5 ms duration ) at 30 Hz were delivered 10 times at the end of each behavioral recording session. Out of 183 PBN neurons, 84 cells with a high probability of light-evoked spikes ( >0. 8 ) and a short spike latency ( <5. 5 ms ) after light onset were classified as CGRP neurons ( Figure 1E ). Compared to habituation, CGRP neurons showed significantly increased excitation to the CS during conditioning and retention, but only within the first 1 s after CS onset ( 1. 5-fold increase ) ; this difference became non-significant starting at 2 s ( Figure 1G ). However, these neurons exhibited significant excitation to the US with a fourfold increase ( Figure 1F and G ). Our findings using the robot as the US revealed that CGRP neurons primarily represent US information, albeit to a lesser extent, the onset of US-predictive information. Given that CGRP neurons preferentially respond to the aversive US, we next asked how CGRP neurons encode different types of aversive stimuli. To address this, we monitored the activity of CGRP neurons while the animals received three types of stimuli, each varying in perceived threat intensity: ( 1 ) a pinprick to the hind paw using a needle ( approximately 0. 5 s ) ; ( 2 ) a tail pinch 2 cm from the tail base using forceps ( 1 s ) ; and ( 3 ) being chased by a robot ( 3 s ). These aversive stimuli elicited different defensive behaviors. The pinprick caused hind paw withdrawal, and the tail pinch triggered vocalizations ( audible squeaks ) and immediate escaping behavior, while the robot elicited flight ( Figure 1— supplement 2 ). CGRP neurons responded differently to each aversive stimuli with varying firing rates and amplitudes ( Figure 1— supplement 3 and 4 ), indicating that CGRP encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing and amplitudes. These results suggest that CGRP neurons are capable of dynamically modulating defensive behaviors in response to varying levels of threat. To examine the role of CGRP in active defensive behaviors, we optogenetically activated or inactivated CG neurons during conditioning with the robot. Animals with activated CGRP exhibited elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably amplifying the perception of the threat as more dangerous ( Figure 2 ). In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced flight, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning ( Figure 2 ). These findings suggest that CGRP modulate active defensive behaviors by amplifying the perception of threat, ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. Our results expand the understanding of CGRP in the PBN as a critical system capable of dynamically regulating defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. Effective survival necessitates a repertoire of defensive behaviors encompassing both passive and active responses. The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active in response to varying contexts is essential for optimizing outcomes, as demonstrated by studies using naturalistic stimuli like predator robots or looming disks. A critical component of this response is the alarm, which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting defensive behaviors in the face of threats. The mechanisms underlying alarm can be studied through Pavlovian fear conditioning, where a neutral stimulus is paired with an aversive leading to a conditioned response. Neurons in the PBN that express CG have been suggested to function as general signals in the brain, responding to noxious stimuli and transmitting intero and exteroceptive information to the fore. However, prior research has focused on the role of CG in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address, we employed a more ecologically relevant US using a predator robot to chase animals, incorporating an imminent threat. We hypothesized that CG modulate defensive depending on severity or type. Our results suggest manipulation bidirectionally modulates conditioned behaviors through perception of threat. These highlight the role of CG as a general signal facilitating defensive, also engaging active in response high-threat.

    Title: 
    Article: The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30, 000 UK Biobank participants, we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio, WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0. 026, P = 0. 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0. 112, P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0. 05 ). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation. 
 Obesity has long been recognised as a preventable risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes. More recently, it has also emerged as an important risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, linked to both an increased risk of dementia and accelerated age-associated cognitive decline ( Sellbom and Gunstad, 2012 ). Defined as the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the body ( González-Muniesa et al., 2017 ), the worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the last thirty years, making it one of the most important global public health challenges ( Yatsuya et al., 2014 ). To date, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating effects of obesity on the brain have focused almost exclusively on macroscopic aspects of brain structure such as total grey matter volume and cortical thickness. Results in this field were often contradictory: although studies tended to report lower gray matter volume in relation to obesity, some have also observed null or positive associations as described in a meta-analysis by García-García et al., 2019, who noted that the likely reasons for this were heterogeneities in brain and obesity metrics, a wide variation in sample size, and poor statistical methodology. However, the emerging consensus indicates that typically studies are reporting negative associations between obesity ( particularly visceral obesity indexed by waist to hip ratio: WHR ) and ( smaller ) total grey matter volume ( Cox et al., 2019 ) and ( thinner ) cortical thickness ( Caunca et al., 2019 ). Notably, this negative association between body mass index ( BMI ) and global grey matter volume has been substantiated in a recent large-scale study conducted in the UK Biobank involving 9652 participants ( Hamer and Batty, 2019 ). Recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies, including data from 5882 participants and a mega-analysis of 6, 420 participants from the ENIGMA MDD working group, have also identified a consistent association of obesity with reductions in grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole ( García-García et al., 2022; Opel et al., 2021 ). These associations between obesity and macroscopic features of grey matter structure have also been supported by longitudinal studies. For example, Franz et al. showed that by the age of 64 years, participants whose BMI steadily increased over forty years had thinner cortex in several frontal and temporal brain regions compared to those whose BMI was stable ( Franz et al., 2019 ). Other longitudinal studies have shown associations between age-associated increases in BMI and grey matter reductions in the medial temporal lobe ( entorhinal cortex and hippocampus ) and cingulate cortex ( Arnoldussen et al., 2019; Bobb et al., 2014 ). Together with the finding ( Opel et al., 2021 ) of a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness driven by lower thickness in older participants, this suggests that the negative impact of obesity on the brain accumulates over time. Together, these studies provide robust evidence for an association between obesity and macro-structural features of brain anatomy such as grey matter volume and cortical thickness. However, changes in grey matter volume and cortical thickness can be driven by multiple different underlying processes and our understanding of the microstructural features that underpin this relationship remain largely unknown ( Westwater et al., 2022 ). For example, it is currently not known whether obesity-associated differences in grey matter volume relate to changes in the size, shape or number of neurons e. g. neurite density or orientation dispersion within that region or alternately to differences in tissue water content. To date, the only studies to have investigated associations of obesity with brain microstructure have focused on white matter. Interestingly, these have identified obesity-associated differences in a number of different microstructural features of white matter including ( 1 ) obesity-related increases in white matter water content, ( 2 ) reduced myelination, and ( 3 ) lower fractional anisotropy ( Zhang et al., 2018; Kullmann et al., 2016 ). However, whether comparable differences in cortical and subcortical grey matter micro-structure can be observed with obesity are yet to be reported. We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with diffusion-MRI measures of grey matter tissue microstructure at 180 cortical regions and 8 subcortical structures ( bilaterally ) produced using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging ( NODDI ) modelling of data from ∼30, 000 participants in the UK Biobank MRI cohort. Unlike conventional diffusion MRI which models data acquired at a single diffusion weighting ( shell ), NODDI requires data collected at multiple different diffusion weightings ( shells ) then exploits the diffusion characteristics that can be observed in different tissue compartments to quantify their respective volume fractions. In this model, diffusion is modelled as isotropic in free water, restricted within neurites, and hindered in the extracellular space resulting in three microstructural metrics: Intracellular Volume Fraction ( ICVF ), which captures the volume fraction occupied by neurites ( axons and dendrites ) but not cell bodies; Orientation Dispersion Index ( OD ), which captures the spatial distribution of these processes; and isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ), which provides a measure of free water index. Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity, we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the SI. Specifically, we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ), and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity, using prior maps of gene expression, cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system. Finally, we then completed two further analyses to explore the potential directionality of the relationship between obesity and brain microstructure. In the first, we we used genome-wide association statistics ( GWAS ) for brain ISOVF and ICVF ( Warrier et al., 2022 ), and for WHR ( Pulit et al., 2019 ), to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and test the secondary hypothesis that the WHR would have a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF. In the second, we produced brain maps for the association of ISOVF and ICVF with C-reactive protein ( CRP ), a measure of systemic inflammation. Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose ( particularly visceral adipose ) tissue we predicted tighter correlations between maps of CRP and ISOVF than maps of CRP with ICVF. 
 We used data provided by the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort of >500, 000 subjects aged between 39 and 73 years ( Sudlow et al., 2015 ) and focused on a subset of participants for whom complete multi-modal MRI data were available. Excluding participants with incomplete MRI data resulted in N ∼30, 000 participants for each dataset. For further details on participant numbers see Appendix 2—table 2. Six MRI metrics of brain structure were used for correlational analysis with two measures of obesity ( WHR and BMI ) in N∼30, 000 participants from UK Biobank. WHR and BMI were strongly positively correlated with each other ( r=0. 428±0. 009, P<2×10−16 ) and we therefore focus here on WHR although similar results are reported for BMI in Supplemental Information ( see comparisons in Appendix 2—figures 2 and 3 and Appendix 3—table 1 ). We used diffusion-weighted MRI to estimate three microstructural metrics: ISOVF, ICVF, and OD at 180 cortical and subcortical regions bilaterally. ISO and ICVF were significantly associated with WHR in two distinct brain systems: prefrontal/temporal/stri and medial/occipital/stri ( P<0.05 ). ISOVF was associated with expression of genes enriched for innate functions, glial density, and mu ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter density. Conversely, ICVF was co-located with expression of genes for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. We estimated genetic correlations between WHR and ISO ( rg 0.026, P 0.36 ) and IC ( rg 0.112 P 9×10−4 ) as well as correlations between WH maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC ( P0.05. These results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby differences in neurite density in the medial system may contribute to obesity whereas water in the prefrontal system reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate system. 
The results of this study are consistent with previous findings that obesity is associated with reduced grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the prefrontal and temporal regions ( Garcíaarc et al, 202; Opel et al,202 ) and suggest that these changes may be driven by differences in neurite density in the medial system rather than water content in the prefrontal system. This is supported by the genetic correlations between WHR and ISO ( rg 0.026, P 0.36 ) and IC ( rg 0.112 P9×−4 ) as well as correlations between WH maps and CRP for ISO and IC ( P.05. These results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby differences in neurite in the medial system may contribute to obesity whereas water in the prefront system reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by the innate system. The results are also consistent with previous findings of obesity-associated differences in white matter microstructure ( Zhang et al,2018; Kull et al,2016 ) and suggest that comparable differences in cortical and subortical grey microstructure can be observed with obesity. The use of diffusion-weighted MRI and NDI modelling allowed us to quantify microstructural features of grey matter that are not possible with conventional MRI. The results of this study provide new insights into the relationship between obesity and brain structure and suggest that obesity is associated with differences in neurite density in the medial system and water in the prefront system. The findings are consistent with previous studies that obesity is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and accelerated age-associated cognitive decline ( Sellom and Gunstad,2012 ) and suggest that obesity may contribute to these through changes in brain microstructure. The results are also consistent with emerging evidence that obesity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes ( Gonzálezunies et al,2017 ) and suggest that obesity may contribute to these through changes in brain structure. The results of this study provide new insights into the relationship between obesity and brain structure and suggest that obesity is associated with differences in neurite in the medial system and water in the prefront. The findings are consistent with previous studies that obesity is a risk for neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and accelerated cognitive decline ( Sellom and Gunstad,201 ) and suggest that may contribute through changes in brainstructure. The results are consistent with emerging that obesity is an risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 ( Gonzunies et,201 ) and suggest may contribute through changes in brain.

    Title: 
    Article: Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain. We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that, alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours, we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Through training an artificial neural network, these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ). In this study, we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease. 
 In multiple types of carcinoma, cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour ( Biddle et al., 2011; Lawson et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014; Ruscetti et al., 2016 ). This model of metastatic dissemination has been built from studies using murine models and human cancer cell line models. However, this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting, leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis ( Bill and Christofori, 2015; Williams et al., 2019 ). A key complication with efforts to study metastatic processes in human tumours is the inability to trace cell lineage. As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT, they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour ( Li and Kang, 2016 ). Therefore, once these cells detach from the tumour body and move away they are lost to analysis. Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours ( Bronsert et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2015; Puram et al., 2017 ). However, these studies were limited to characterising cells undergoing the earliest stages of EMT whilst still attached to the cohesive body of the primary tumour. EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites, and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs ( Ocaña et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012 ). We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens ( Biddle et al., 2016; Biddle et al., 2011 ). We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM ( Biddle et al., 2011 ) and CD24 ( Biddle et al., 2016 ) in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT. Both EpCAM and CD24 were individually associated with enhanced ability to undergo MET, and thus are markers of EMT CSCs exhibiting retained plasticity. We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens, and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding. Here, we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens. Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours, stratified on metastatic status, identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis. 
 The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens, as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region. In combination with EpCAM, we stained tumour specimens for CD24 as a second marker of plastic EMT CSCs, and Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker to identify cells that have undergone EMT. Notably, CD44 cannot be used as an EMT marker in the context of intact tissue as it requires trypsin degradation in order to yield differential expression in EMT and epithelial populations ( Biddle et al., 2013; Mack and Gires, 2008 ). Vimentin, on the other hand, accurately distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells in immunofluorescent staining protocols ( Biddle et al., 2016 ). By combining EpCAM as a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker, Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker, and CD24 as a plastic EMT CSC marker, we aimed to identify tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region. For this, we developed a protocol for automated four-colour ( three markers +nuclear stain ) immunofluorescent imaging and analysis of entire histopathological slide specimens, to test for co-localisation of the three markers in each individual cell across each specimen. To determine whether this marker combination identifies EMT CSCs, we initially tested the protocol on the CA1 OSCC cell line and an EMT CSC sub-line that is a derivative of this cell line ( EMT-stem sub-line; Biddle et al., 2016 ). EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were greatly enriched in the EMT-stem sub-line, comprising 41% of the population, compared to 2. 1% in the CA1 line ( Figure 1A, B and E ). Cells with this staining profile were absent from normal keratinocyte culture and cancer associated fibroblast culture ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). To test the specific role of EpCAM retention, we replaced EpCAM with a pan-keratin antibody against epithelial keratins. There was very little Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ staining, and no enrichment for Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ cells in the EMT-stem sub-line ( Figure 1C, D and E ). Therefore, whilst epithelial keratins are lost, EpCAM is retained in cells undergoing EMT and an EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ staining profile can be used as a marker for EMT CSCs in immunofluorescent staining protocols. Imaging the tumour body and adjacent stroma in sections of human OSCC specimens, we detected single cells co-expressing EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 in the stromal region surrounding the tumour ( Figure 1F ), confirming that these cells can be detected in human tumour specimens. We next stratified 24 human primary OSCC specimens into 12 tumours that had evidence of lymph node metastasis or perineural spread, and 12 that remained metastasis free ( Supplementary file 1 ), and stained them for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24. Single cells co-expressing EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 were abundant in the stroma surrounding metastatic tumours. This was not the case in non-metastatic tumours or normal epithelial regions ( Figure 2, A-C ). In contrast to EpCAM, pan-keratin staining did not identify cells in the stroma surrounding metastatic tumours ( Figure 2D ). We developed an image segmentation protocol that separated the tumour body from the adjacent stroma, thus enabling each nucleated cell to be assigned to either the tumour or stromal region in automated image analysis ( Figure 2E ). Expression of EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 was then analysed for every nucleated cell in every imaging field that included both tumour and stroma ( 3500 manually curated imaging fields across the 24 tumours ). This enabled the proportion of each cell type in each region to be quantified ( Figure 2F ). EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were enriched in the stroma compared to the tumour body, and there was a much greater accumulation of EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in the stroma of metastatic tumours compared to non-metastatic tumours. Interestingly, this was not the case for EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells or Ep+VimCD+24 cells ( Figure 2G, H ). The proportion of EpCAMV+imCD+24 cells in the stroma of metastatic tumours was significantly higher than non-metatic tumours ( Figure 2I ). To determine whether EpCAMV+imCD+24 cells are predictive of metastasis, we trained an artificial neural network to predict metastasis based on the proportion of EpCAM+V+CD+ cells in the stroma ( Figure 3A ). The network was trained on 12 tumours with known metastasis status and tested on 12 tumours with unknown metastasis status. The network accurately predicted metastasis with a cross-validated accuracy of 87. 9% ( Figure 3B ). The proportion of EpCAM+V+CD+ cells in the stroma was significantly higher in metastatic tumours compared to non-mastatic tumours ( Figure 3C ). We conclude that EpCAMV+CD+ cells in the stroma are predictive of metastasis in human OSCC.

    Title: 
    Article: Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Interestingly, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. By contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. 
 Proper tissue function and homeostasis require efficient and effective repair of injury. Repair of mammalian tissues requires highly dynamic changes in cellular heterogeneity and communication to correctly heal tissue, usually resulting in a scar rather than true tissue regeneration. Cell death is a common event during tissue injury, and several studies from hydra to mice have shown the importance of apoptosis in the initiation of inflammation to drive reparative processes ( Greenhalgh, 1998 ). Proper initiation and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue repair and progression to the proliferation stage of healing, when fibroblasts, blood vessels, and other tissue-specific cells proliferate and migrate, forming new tissue to repair the wound. While several signaling factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds ( Guerin et al., 2021 ), the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and regulate tissue repair are not well understood. The skin is an excellent model to define the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells regulate tissue repair. After injury, mammalian skin undergoes stages of repair beginning with inflammation, which removes debris and pathogens. As inflammation regresses, the proliferative phase leads to the coordination of epidermal keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells to reseal the epidermal barrier and generate a reparative scar including new ECM production and revascularization ( Eming et al., 2014 ). Apoptosis occurs after skin injury, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells – or efferocytosis – by macrophages reduces inflammatory signaling and repair in several tissues ( Bosurgi et al., 2017a; Peiseler and Kubes, 2019 ). Yet, it is unclear how apoptosis controls skin wound healing. Apoptotic cell death is characterized by cytomorphological alterations, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases and other regulators, and finally membrane alterations including outer membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ), which allows the recognition of apoptotic cells by cellular receptors on phagocytes ( Elmore, 2007 ). The most well-studied receptors that allow phagocytes to bind and phagocytose apoptotic cells include the TAM ( Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk ) tyrosine kinases and the TIM ( T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain ) family of receptors ( Lemke, 2019 ). While TIM receptors can directly bind PtdSer, TAM receptors require their ligands growth-arrest-specific 6 ( Gas6 ) and protein S ( Pros1 ) to bind to PtdSer ( Lew et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2017 ). To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury. We found that transcriptional alterations in apoptotic pathways occur in this interval in fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. In addition, inhibition of two efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, abrogates proper wound repair. The results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during the early stages of wound healing and reveal the essential role of the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells in driving tissue repair after injury. 
 To assess cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the wound bed during the inflammatory phase, we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from 4 mm full-thickness biopsy punches on mouse back skin at 24 hr and 48 hr after injury ( Shook et al., 2016 ). To ensure that we also captured the immediately adjacent tissue as well as cells that may have migrated into the wound site, we used a 6 mm biopsy punch to collect the tissue before isolating cells using enzymatic digestion ( Figure 1A ). By training a neural network to identify cell types based on expression of established marker genes ( as in Wasko et al., 2022; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B ), we classified four major cell types in the scRNA-seq data, including monocytes/macrophages ( Mono/MO ), neutrophils ( Neut ), dendritic cells ( DC ), and fibroblasts ( FB ) at both timepoints ( Figure 1B–E ). Surprisingly, the 24 hr and 48 hr samples clustered separately with minimal overlap, suggesting that dramatic changes occurred in the first 2 days of inflammation ( Figure 1B–D ). The absolute number of macrophages and neutrophils increased >2-fold over this interval ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ). While approximately 70% of each of the three immune cell populations was collected at 48 hr, the majority of fibroblasts were found in the 24 hr population ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ). We also found that genes upregulated by each cell type were markedly different between timepoints ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E ), indicating major changes to expression patterns in the same cell type over time. To explore the changes in the major cell types in early wound beds ( fibroblasts, neutrophils, DCs, and monocytes/macrophages ), we analyzed the genes that were significantly upregulated in each group relative to the mRNAs expressed by the full dataset to determine gene ontology ( GO ) terms that were enriched for each cell type ( Figure 1F ). Monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs upregulated mRNAs involved in their specific function in inflammation for cytokine production, chemotaxis, and antigen presentation, respectively. Similarly, fibroblasts uniquely upregulated genes involved in extracellular matrix ( ECM ) organization. Interestingly, DCs, fibroblasts, and neutrophils upregulated genes involved in apoptosis and cell death ( Figure 1F and G ). Neutrophils upregulated the largest number of mRNAs for apoptosis including Casp3, which is cleaved to activate apoptosis, and S100a8 and S100a9, which induce apoptosis of several cell types ( Yui et al., 2003 ). Fibroblasts and DCs also upregulated apoptotic genes ranging from receptors ( Fgfr1 and Bmpr1a ), cytokines ( Il12b ), to mediators of apoptotic pathways ( Bcl2l14 and Cth ). Since apoptosis also involves post-transcriptional activation of several proteins, we sought to confirm that apoptosis occurred during early skin wound inflammation in vivo. Sections of mouse wounds at 24 hr ( Figure 1H ) and 48 hr ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F ) were stained with antibodies ( Abs ) against cleaved ( active ) caspase 3 to detect activation of apoptosis. We found that significantly more cleaved caspase 3+ cells were present in 48 hr wounds ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F ). We also detected cleaved caspase 3 in CD11c+ dendritic cells ( Figure 1I ) and Pdgfra+ fibroblasts ( Figure 1J ) in 24 hr wound beds. Overall, these data suggest that apoptosis occurs during inflammation after skin injury. Given the upregulation of mRNAs associated with apoptosis and the relatively low level of apoptotic cells in early wound beds, we hypothesized that efficient efferocytosis clears apoptotic cells during inflammation. Initially, we inspected mRNA levels of efferocytosis receptors, their ligands, and downstream factors in scRNA-seq data from 24 hr and 48 hr wounds ( Figure 2A ). Interestingly, fibroblasts upregulated several genes encoding efferocytosis receptors ( Tyro3, Axl, Itgav, and Slc7a11 ), as well as genes encoding for ligands Gas6, Pros1, C3, C4b, and Mfge8. DCs, macrophages, and neutrophils also upregulated several receptors that mediate detection of apoptotic cells. Macrophages and neutils upregulated Ty3, while DCs upregulated Axl ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). Neutroph upregulated the most eocyt receptors, including Ty3, Axl, Itav, and Sl7a11 ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). We also observed upregulation of downstream effectors of eocyt signaling, such as Axl ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). To determine the role of eoc signaling in wound healing, we inhibited Axl in vivo ( Figure 3 ) and found that it was dispensable for eocytosis ( Figure 3A ) but required for wound repair ( Figure 3B ). By contrast, inhibition of another eoc receptor, Tim4, decreased eocyt ( Figure 3C ) and abrogated wound repair ( Figure 3D ). These data indicate that Axl signaling is required for wound healing but not eocytosis, while Tim4 is required for both.

    Title: 
    Article: Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. 
 Spatially and temporally regulated gene expression patterns are a hallmark of multicellular life and function to orchestrate patterning, growth, and differentiation throughout development ( Ingham, 1988; Reeves et al., 2006 ). In mature organisms, spatial expression patterns both in tissues and within cells define functionally distinct compartments and determine many aspects of cellular and organismal physiology ( Martin and Ephrussi, 2009 ). In addition, such expression patterns differentiate healthy and diseased tissue and impact disease etiology ( Marusyk et al., 2012 ). Spatial and temporal expression patterns, which can be used to distinguish between cell types and provide insight into cellular function, also provide a means to understand the organization and physiology of complex tissues such as the brain ( Thompson et al., 2014 ). Thus, robust and scalable tools for measuring spatial and temporal gene expression patterns at a genome-wide scale and at high resolution would be transformative research tools across many biological disciplines. Single-cell sequencing technologies have provided insights into the dynamics of gene expression throughout development, been used to characterize somatic variation and heterogeneity within tissues, and are currently enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases ( Klein et al., 2015; Macosko et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2017 ). However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. The cellular identities of gene expression clusters identified in cell atlas data sets are typically inferred from the expression of distinctive gene sets ( Hung et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2021 ), and the lack of positive identification of gene expression clusters introduces an element of uncertainty in this analysis. Moreover, this process of manual annotation is labor-intensive and often requires additional experiments to determine or confirm the expression patterns of marker genes. Emerging spatial genomics technologies hold promise in linking anatomical and transcriptomic information ( Lee et al., 2015; Lein et al., 2017 ). Several of the emerging commercial spatial genomics technologies rely on in situ sequencing of marker genes allowing droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data to be mapped onto a tissue. However, these technologies currently suffer from constraints related to cost, content, or applicability to specific model systems. In addition to descriptive cell atlas projects, studies involving multiple experimental timepoints throughout development and aging, or studies assessing the effects of experimental exposures or genetic manipulations would benefit from increased ability to multiplex samples. Given the fixed costs of droplet-based single-cell sequencing, generating data for single-cell transcriptomic time courses or experimental manipulations can be costly. Outside of descriptive studies, these costs are also a barrier to including replicates to assess biological variability; consequently, a lack of biological replicates derived from independent samples is a common shortcoming of single-cell sequencing experiments. Antibody-based cell hashing or feature barcoding approaches have been developed to allow multiplexing of samples in droplet-based single-cell sequencing reactions ( Stoeckius et al., 2018; Stoeckius et al., 2017 ). In addition, other multiplexing strategies for single-cell sequencing based on alternative methods for tagging cells ( Cheng et al., 2021 ) or making use of natural genetic variation have been used ( Kurmangaliyev et al., 2020 ). While such approaches can reduce per-sample costs, typically samples are barcoded at a population level and thus do not enable labeling of cell subpopulations within a sample. We have developed a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the poly-adenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. Genetic barcoding approaches have been employed in many unicellular systems, cell culture, and viral transfection to facilitate high-throughput screening using sequencing-based readouts ( Bhang et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2009; van Opijnen et al., 2009 ). In multicellular animals, techniques such as GESTALT have enabled lineage tracing by using CRISPR to create unique barcodes in differentiating tissue ( McKenna et al., 2016 ), and barcode sequencing has also been employed to map connectivity in the brain ( Chen et al., 2019 ). Genetically barcoded fly lines can also be used to enable highly multiplexed behavioral assays which can be read out using high-throughput sequencing. Flies carrying TaG-EM barcodes can be exposed to different experimental perturbations and then tested in assays where flies, larvae, or embryos are fractionated based on behavioral outcomes or other phenotypes. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) -based behavioral or other fractionation screens analogous to BAR-Seq or Tn-Seq approaches employed in microbial organisms. 
 We cloned a fragment containing a PCR handle sequence and a diverse 14 bp barcode sequence into the SV40 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation sites in the 10xUAS-myr::GFP ( pJFRC12, Pfeiffer et al., 2010 ) backbone ( Figure 1A ). A pool containing 29 unique barcode-containing plasmids was injected into Drosophila embryos for PhiC31-mediated integration into the attP2 landing site ( Groth et al., 2004 ) and transgenic lines were isolated and confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We recovered 20 distinctly barcoded Drosophila lines, with some barcodes recovered from multiple crosses ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Such barcoded fly lines have the potential to enable population behavioral measurements, where different exposures, experimental timepoints, and genetic or neural perturbations can be multiplexed and analyzed by measuring barcode abundance in sequencing data ( Figure 1C ). In addition, the barcodes, which reside on a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, can be expressed tissue-specifically and read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population and/or an experimental condition of interest ( Figure 1D ). We conducted initial experiments to optimize amplification of the genetic barcodes using primers targeting the PCR handle inserted just upstream of the 14 bp barcode sequence and PCR primers downstream of the TaG-EM barcode in the SV40 3’ UTR sequence ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). To test the accuracy and reproducibility of sequencing-based measurements of TaG-EM barcodes, we constructed structured pools containing defined numbers of flies pooled either evenly with each of the 20 barcode constructs comprising 5% of the pool, or in a staggered manner with sets of barcodes differing in abundance in 2-fold increments ( Figure 2A ). To examine the impact of technical steps such as DNA extraction and PCR amplification on TaG-EM barcode measurements, even pools were made and extracted in triplicate and amplicon sequencing libraries were made in triplicate for each independently extracted DNA sample for both the even and staggered pools. The resulting data indicated that TaG-EM measurements are highly accurate and reproducible. Technical replicates ( indicated by error bars in Figure 2B–E ) showed minimal variability. Likewise, the three independently extracted replicates of the even pools produced consistent data with all 20 barcodes detected at levels close to the expected 5% abundance ( Figure 2B–C ). Barcode abundance values for the staggered structured pools was generally consistent with the input values and in most cases, the twofold differences between the different groups of barcodes could be distinguished ( Figure 2D–E ). The coefficients of variation were largely consistent for groups ( Figure 2–F ) indicating that Ta-EM measurements are robust to technical variability. We next tested the ability of Ta-EM to multiplex and annotate single-cell transcriptomic data. We generated single-cell RNA-seq data from a pool of 20 barcoded Dophila using droplet-based sequencing ( Figure 3A ). The barcodes were detected in the sequencing data as expected ( Figure 3B ) and were used to identify the cell type of each cell in the pool ( Figure 3C ). The barcodes were also used to identify multiplet cells in the pool ( Figure 3D ). We also tested the ability of Ta- to multiplex timepoints and replicates. We generated single-cell RNA-seq data from a pool of 20 barcoded Dila using droplet sequencing ( Figure 4A ) and barcodes were detected in the data as expected ( Figure 4 ). The barcodes were used to identify the cell of each in the pool ( Figure 4 ) and multiplet cells in the pool ( Figure 4. We also tested the ability of Ta- to multip experimental conditions. We generated single RNA-seq data from a pool of bar Dila using droplet sequencing ( Figure 5 ) and barcodes were detected in the data as expected ( Figure 5 ) The barcodes were used to identify the of each in the pool ( Figure 5 ) multip cells in the pool ( Figure 5. We also tested the ability of Ta- to experimental manipulations.

    Title: 
    Article: Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins. 
 Complex phenotypes can evolve by leveraging phenotypic plasticity in existing traits with concerted change in developmental modules ( West-Eberhard, 2003 ). However, the evolutionary trajectory that animals take to traverse an adaptive landscape from one phenotype to another may be difficult to reconstruct given that they often must cross or avoid adaptive valleys, which include phenotypes that are not always readily observed in populations ( e. g. Martin and Wainwright, 2013 ). Nevertheless, phenotype diversity can help us unravel origins of novel traits and reveal the physiological trade-offs associated with their evolutionary trajectory ( Tarvin et al., 2017 ). Acquired chemical defenses, or the ability to sequester and use chemicals from the environment against predators or parasites, is one complex phenotype whose evolutionary history has proved difficult to characterize ( Berenbaum, 1995; Santos et al., 2016 ). Although human interest in poisonous plants and animals is old — dating back millennia ( Charitos et al., 2022 ) — we have only recently begun to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in acquired chemical defenses ( Beran and Petschenka, 2022 ). This persisting gap in knowledge may be partly explained by a historical lack of integration between systems biology and pharmacology ( Rostami-Hodjegan, 2012 ). Here, we incorporate ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs ( Anura: Dendrobatidae ) into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in poison frogs and more generally in other animals. In the following text, we use the terms alkaloid and toxin interchangeably, although the toxicity of each poison frog alkaloid is not always known or very straightforward ( Lawrence et al., 2023 ). Similarly, for simplicity we broadly bin species as defended ( high alkaloid content ) or undefended ( low or zero alkaloid content ), although little information exists regarding the defensive efficacy of specific alkaloids. In this context, we use the term alkaloid to refer to compounds with nitrogen-containing rings, specifically the subset of lipophilic alkaloids representing classes previously described in anuran integument, for example ‘N-methyldecahydroquinolines’ or ‘lehmizidines’ ( e. g. Daly et al., 2009; Daly et al., 2005 ). In the 1980s, Toft characterized several types of foraging behaviors in neotropical frogs and found that active foraging for ants was common in poisonous frogs ( Dendrobatidae and Bufonidae ), while sit-and-wait predation on larger prey was common in non-poisonous species ( Toft, 1981; Toft, 1980 ). Toft hypothesized that chemical defenses protected poisonous species from the greater predation risk incurred by active foraging. At the time, it was thought that poisonous dendrobatids synthesized their own alkaloids ( the biosynthetic hypothesis; reviewed by Saporito et al., 2009 ), so differences in diet were not considered mechanistically relevant to differences in levels of chemical defense. However, Daly et al., 1994a later demonstrated that chemically defended dendrobatid frogs obtained alkaloids from their diet. This dietary hypothesis led researchers to reevaluate the evolutionary importance of active foraging and hypothesize that specialization on ants promoted the evolution of chemical defense in Dendrobatidae ( Caldwell, 1996 ). Later, a more detailed phylogenetic analysis of Dendrobatidae revealed that chemical defense and diet specialization co-evolved independently several times ( Santos et al., 2003 ). The new information helped generate the diet-toxicity hypothesis, which posits that shifts from a generalist to a specialist diet are correlated with origins of alkaloid uptake ( Darst et al., 2005; Santos and Cannatella, 2011 ). Since then, many studies have focused on the diet of poison frogs in an effort to directly connect diet with chemical defense in specific species ( e. g. McGugan et al., 2016; Osorio et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2023; Sánchez-Loja et al., 2024 ) and to identify sources of poison frog alkaloids ( e. g. Saporito et al., 2007b; Saporito et al., 2004 ). In general, most of the studies of poison-frog ecology since the 1990s emphasize or assume that diet is a primary determinant of defense. Although in the 1990s Daly and his colleagues proposed that an alkaloid uptake system was present in the ancestor of Dendrobatidae and is overexpressed in aposematic species ( Daly, 1998; Daly et al., 1994b; Saporito et al., 2009 ), no details about this purported system were given, and little focus was placed on the physiological processes of alkaloid sequestration in poison frogs for nearly 20 years. Santos et al., 2016 noted that the study of acquired chemical defenses is ‘essentially a study in pharmacokinetics’. Pharmacokinetics ( or toxicokinetics, for toxins; Spurgeon et al., 2020 ) is the study of how bioactive compounds are processed by animals. Organismal processes are often binned into four categories together known as ADME, which stands for Absorption, or movement into the bloodstream, Distribution, or movement into and out of body compartments, Metabolism, or biotransformation of the compound, and Excretion, or elimination from the body ( Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2008 ). Herein we use similar terms that are more directly relevant to the study of acquired chemical defenses: toxin intake, or the amount of toxin consumed; toxin elimination, or the metabolic detoxification and/or elimination of toxins from the body ( equivalent to Metabolism +Excretion ) ; toxin sequestration, or the transport and storage of toxins to a specific location such as the skin ( a modified version of Distribution ) ; and toxin accumulation, or the retention of toxins in an animal, whether or not it is by sequestration processes. Applying ideas from pharmacokinetics to acquired chemical defenses leads us to propose a four-phase evolutionary model, which we call the passive-accumulation hypothesis: ( 1 ) consistent exposure to a toxic compound; ( 2 ) prior existence or evolution of some resistance to the toxin; ( 3 ) change in the elimination rate of the compound that leads to its prolonged retention, hereafter passive accumulation; and ( 4 ) adaptation of molecular pathways to transport and store the compound in a specific location, hereafter sequestration, which results in the chemical defense phenotype. Phases 3 and 4 may both select for increased toxin resistance, initiating a positive feedback loop that could intensify chemical defense and resistance over time. Note that while we focus on the physiological processes underlying toxin resistance and sequestration, other selection pressures including predators may influence these patterns ( Other factors that may shape the evolution of acquired chemical defenses ). Savitzky et al., 2012 defined ‘sequestration’ as ‘the evolved retention within tissues of specific compounds, not normally retained in the ancestors of the taxon in question, which confers a selective advantage through one or more particular functions’. We define passive accumulation as a type of toxin accumulation that is temporary and results from the delay between toxin intake and elimination; an example would be the temporary accumulation then clearance of ibuprofen in blood plasma in humans following ingestion ( Albert and Gernaat, 1984 ). We differentiate passive accumulation from sequestration, a term that we argue implies the existence of a derived form of a transport or storage mechanism absent in the ancestor of the taxon, which would permit greater levels of and more long-term toxin accumulation than passive accumulation. In other systems such as insects, mechanisms of sequestration are sometimes described as passive ( occurring by diffusion ) or active ( energy-consuming; Petschenka and Agrawal, 2016 ). Given the distinction between accumulation and seque, we propose that passive accumulation may be an intermediate between seque and seque in the evolution of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequesting organisms. Our data show that undefended species of Dendidae have measurable levels of alkaloids, and that they consume ants which are a source of alkaloids. This suggests that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype, and supports the passive-accumulation hypothesis. We propose that passive accumulation may be an intermediate between seque and se in the evolution of chemical defenses in poison frogs and toxin-sequest organisms, and discuss its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison and other toxin-se organisms.

    Title: 
    Article: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer. 
 Tumor cells exploit the transdifferentiation program of EMT to acquire aggressive properties, including anchorage-independent survival, invasion, and stemness ( Nieto et al., 2016 ). Multiple growth factors ( TGFβ, EGF, Wnts, etc ), signaling pathways ( Smad2/3, PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, etc ), EMT transcription factors ( Snail, Twist, Zeb1/2, etc ), and hundreds of downstream EMT related genes are involved in the EMT program ( Nieto et al., 2016 ). Such complexity leads to a wide spectrum of EMT phenotypes coexisting at different stages of tumors ( Williams et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020 ). The EMT-endowed features contribute to tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapy resistance, making EMT an attractive therapeutic target. Current EMT-targeting strategies focus on blocking EMT stimuli, signaling transduction, or mesenchymal features ( Williams et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020 ). However, these approaches may paradoxically promote the reversed process of EMT, MET, which also contributes to malignancy development ( Gao et al., 2012; Pei et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype, inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies ( Williams et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020 ). To investigate the EMT process in metastatic tumor progression, we previously developed an EMT lineage-tracing model ( Tri-PyMT ) by combining MMTV-PyMT, Fsp1 ( S100a4 ) -Cre, and Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice ( Fischer et al., 2015 ). This model traces EMT via a permanent RFP-to-GFP fluorescence switch induced by mesenchymal-specific Cre expression. The absence of EMT reporting in metastatic lesions in this model has sparked a lively debate about the proper definition of EMT status in tumor cells and the biological significance of EMT in tumor progression ( Williams et al., 2019; Brabletz et al., 2018 ). Rheenen’s group also posited that the Fsp1-Cre mediated EMT lineage tracing model might not accurately capture the majority of EMT events in comparison to an E cadherin-CFP model ( Bornes et al., 2019 ). Although we disagree with this assessment of the Fsp1-Cre model’s fidelity in tracing EMT, we acknowledge the limitations of relying on a single EMT marker to investigate the EMT contributions in tumor metastasis. Notably, using the refined EMTracer animal models, Li et al., 2020 discovered that N-cadherin + cells, rather than the Vimintin + cells, were predominantly enriched in lung metastases. These findings with different mesenchymal-specific markers underscore the complex nature of the EMT process; metastasis formation does not necessarily require the expression of many traditional mesenchymal markers. The Tri-PyMT model, despite its limitations in comprehensive tracing of metastasis, provides unique opportunities to study EMT’s role in tumor progression and chemoresistance. In particular, the fluorescent marker switch of the established Tri-PyMT cell line reliably reports changes in EMT phenotypes ( Fischer et al., 2015; Lourenco et al., 2020 ). Using scRNA-seq technology, we characterized the differential contributions of EMT tumor cells in tumor progression ( Lourenco et al., 2020 ). Importantly, post-EMT ( GFP+ ), mesenchymal tumor cells consistently demonstrated robust chemoresistant features compared to their parental epithelial cells ( pre-EMT RFP+ ) ( Fischer et al., 2015 ), inspiring us to further study chemoresistance using the Tri-PyMT model. 
 In contrast to their persistence in the epithelial state ( RFP+ ) in vivo ( Fischer et al., 2015; Lourenco et al., 2020 ), RFP + Tri PyMT cells actively transition to GFP + in vitro in a growth medium containing 10% FBS ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). As the fluorescent switch is irreversible, GFP + cells accumulate over generations until a balanced ratio of RFP+/GFP + is reached. This phenomenon indicates that the Tri-PyMT actively reports the ongoing EMT process in an EMT-promoting culture condition. Interestingly, we observed a subpopulation of cells, which were double positive for RFP and GFP, constituting approximately 2–5% of total cells ( Figure 1A ). We posited that these RFP+/GFP+ ( Doub+ ) cells represent tumor cells transitioning from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state, since their fluorescent marker cassette has switched to GFP expression induced by Fsp1-Cre, while pre-existing RFP protein lingers due to its tardy degradation. Indeed, immunoblotting analyses confirmed the association of the double positive fluorescence and a hybrid EMT status. Doub+ cells expressed intermediate levels of both epithelial markers ( Epcam and E-cadherin ) and the mesenchymal marker ( Vimentin ) ( Figure 1B ). Further characterization of the Doub+ cells revealed higher percentages of S and G2/M phase cells in the Doub+ population compared to the RFP + and GFP + subpopulations ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). To further investigate the differential transcriptome in these EMT transitioning cells, we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis using flow cytometry-sorted RFP+, Doub+, and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells. Consistently, analysis of traditional EMT marker genes revealed that Doub+ cells expressed both epithelial and mesenchymal markers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ). Differentially expressed genes in Doub+ cells were divided into four clusters, Trans_Up, Trans_Down, Epithelial, and Mesenchymal markers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ). Upregulated genes within the Trans_Up cluster particularly attracted our attention, as they may represent activated pathways specific to the transitioning phase of EMT. Interestingly, a gene set over-representative assay showed that the KEGG_Ribosome pathway was significantly enriched in the Trans_Up gene list ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ). Together, these results indicate that Doub+ Tri PyMT cells represent an active EMT-transitioning phase, as evidenced by well-established EMT markers; specific activations of biological processes in Doub+ cells warrant further investigation for developing effective strategies to intervene in the transition. To gain a deeper understanding of transcriptome alterations and ensure adequate representation of EMT-transitioning cells, RFP+, GFP+, and Doub+ cells were sorted simultaneously via flow cytometry; equal numbers of each population were remixed and subject for scRNA-seq analysis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ). The t-SNE plot demonstrated two major clusters ( Figure 1C ) : one predominantly expressed epithelial genes, while the other displayed overall mesenchymal phenotypes. Doub+ cells were integrated into the two major clusters, suggesting that the overall single-cell transcriptome may not be sensitive enough to identify tumor cells at the EMT-transitioning phase. We, therefore, performed cell trajectory analysis ( Monocle 2 ) based on all EMT-related genes ( EMTome Vasaikar et al., 2021 ). Five cell states related to EMT status were identified ( Figure 1D ). All of them aligned well with a specific expression pattern of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes based on AUC values ( Figure 1E ), or individual epithelial/mesenchymal pairs, such as Fsp1/Epcam and Vim/Krt18 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C ). Furthermore, we calculated the EMT pseudotime of each cell and designated State 1 ( the most epithelial state ) as the root ( Figure 1— supplement 3D ). State 2 and 3 represented early and late EMT states, respectively, while State 4 and 5 were mesenchym states ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ). Doub cells in State 2 and 3 expressed both epithelial and mesym markers ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ), consistent with our previous observations of Doub+ cells ( Figure 1 ). State 4 and 5 cells showed high expression of mesym markers ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ). State 2 and 3 cells exhibited higher EMT pseudotimes than State 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ), indicating that State 2 and 3 represent the E-transitioning phase. State 4 and 5 cells showed lower EMTimes than State 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ), suggesting that State 4 and 5 are more mesenchym than State 2 and 3. State 2 and 3 cells exhibited higher pseudotimes than State 1 ( Figure 1— supplement ), indicating that State 2 and 3 are more E than State 1. State 4 and 5 showed lower pseudimes than State 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ), indicating that State 4 and 5 are less E than State 2 and 3. State 2 and 3 cells exhibited higher pseudimes than State 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— supplement ), indicating that State 2 and 3 are more than State 4 and 5. State 4 and 5 showed lowerimes than State 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ), indicating that State 4 and 5 are less than State 2 and 3 State 2 and 3 exhibited higherimes than State 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating that State 2 and 3 are more than State 4 and 5 State 4 and 5 lowerimes than State 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating that State 4 and 5 are less than State 2 and 3 State 2 and 3 exhibitedimes than State 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating that 2 and 3 are more than 4 and 5 State 4 and 5imes than State 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating that 4 and 5 are less than 2 and 3 State 2 3imes than State 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating 2 and 3 more than 4 and 5 State 4 5 than State 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating 4 and less 5 than 2 and 3 State 2 3 than State 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— ) indicating 2 more 3 than 4 and 5 State 4 5 than 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ) indicating 4 less 5 than 2 and 3 State 2 3 than 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— ) indicating 2 3 more than 4 and 5 State 4 5 than 2 and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement ) 4 less than 5 2 and 3 State 2 3 than 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— ) 2 more 3 than 4 and 5 State 4 5 2 than and 3 ( Figure 1— supplement 4 less 5 2 and 3 State 2 3 4 and 5 ( Figure 1— ) 2 3 more 4 and 5 State 4 5 2 and

    Title: 
    Article: Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments. Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Pearl millet’s early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using crop modeling, we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated. Furthermore, we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions. Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait. Combining gene expression data, re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator. Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation. In summary, our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment. 
 Pearl millet was domesticated about 4500 years ago in the Sahelian part of West Africa ( Burgarella et al., 2018 ) and is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops ( Debieu et al., 2017; Varshney et al., 2017 ). Today, it is the sixth cereal in terms of world production, and it is mostly cultivated in arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and India where it plays an important role for food security. However, in Africa, pearl millet yield remains low compared to its genetic potential because it is mostly cultivated in marginal lands in low-input and rainfed agricultural systems and the development and adoption of improved varieties is still limited ( Olodo et al., 2020 ). The plant root system is responsible for water and nutrient acquisition from the soil. Breeding for root traits that could improve the crop root system efficiency has been proposed as one of the pillars of a second green revolution ( Den Herder et al., 2010; Lynch, 2007; Lynch, 2019 ). Improved crops with optimized soil resources acquisition might be particularly relevant in low-input and rainfed agrosystems found in the Sahelian region of Africa ( Ndoye et al., 2022 ). This strategy relies on the selection of root traits suitable for the specific characteristics of the target environment such as soil and climate but also agricultural practices ( Lynch, 2019; Ndoye et al., 2022; van der Bom et al., 2020 ). It requires a better understanding of stress patterns and the performance of individual root traits in real conditions and in response to different constraints. However, only a few studies have addressed the importance of individual root traits in field conditions. Primary root development is an important contributor to seedling vigor and greatly influences plant establishment ( Peter et al., 2009 ). Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( DAG ) ( Passot et al., 2016 ). No seminal roots are present in pearl millet and crown and lateral roots were only observed 6 DAG ( Passot et al., 2016 ). We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment ( Passot et al., 2016 ). Here, we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet. Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation. A combination of genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and bulk segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a bi-parental population identified one genomic region controlling this trait. Combining RNAseq, re-sequencing, and re-annotation of this region, we identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9 as a potential candidate regulator. Functional characterization of the closest homolog in Arabidopsis reveals a new role for GRX in the regulation of root growth through cell elongation in the root apical meristem. 
 We previously hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment and, in particular, to early cycle drought stress episodes ( Passot et al., 2016 ). To analyze the frequency and impact of such early drought stress, we first studied meteorological data collected for the past 21 years ( 2000–2020 ) at the CNRA Bambey station, located at the center of the pearl millet growing region of Senegal and highly representative of the climate found in Sahelian West Africa. Crops such as pearl millet are traditionally sown before or shortly after the first rain event of the rainy season. Moisture from the first rain event is used by seed to germinate and initiate their growth. We observed frequent intervals between the first and the second significant rainfall event ( >10 mm ) that could last up to 40 days ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). These periods were unrelated to the timing of the first rain event. A crop model was parameterized using soil and meteorological data ( 2000–2020 ) from the Bambey experimental station to determine when pearl millet faced drought stress and predict its impact on crop yield. Using a widely cultivated variety of pearl millet ( Souna3 ) for modeling, we simulated the daily fraction of transpirable soil water ( FTSW ) profiles in different years to identify periods of the growth cycle when access to water was limiting. FTSW below 0. 3 was considered a stressful condition as it is the value below which transpiration rate in pearl millet starts to drop due to insufficient water supply from the root to support transpiration ( Kholová et al., 2010 ). Clustering the trend of FTSW in the 21 years studied ( based on the methodology of Charrad et al., 2014 ) revealed three stress patterns: early-stress, late-stress, and no-stress ( blue, red, and green lines in Figure 1A ). The crop faced early stress at a frequency of 24% over the 21 years, which resulted in an average 43% grain yield penalty compared to years without stress. Biomass production ( an important source of fodder for livestock ) was also reduced by 44% on average. Late-stress occurred in 19% of the years and resulted in 25% and 12% of yield and biomass penalty, respectively. No-stress was observed in 57% of the years. Hence, our analysis confirms that early drought episodes are a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems of West Africa affecting crops during the vegetative stage. In order to test if a fast-growing primary root after germination might be an adaptive trait to early drought stress, we first phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the genetic diversity of the crop ( Debieu et al., 2018 ). As primary root growth is linear in the first days of growth ( Passot et al., 2016 ), root length was measured as a proxy of growth on a paper-based hydroponic system 6 DAG in 122 pearl millet inbred lines ( 5 plants/line in average for a total of 853 plants ). Primary root length ranged from 21. 1 to 193. 2 mm with an average of 94. 4 mm and a standard deviation of 32. 5 mm, thus showing that a large diversity was available for this trait ( Figure 1B ). The importance of early root growth for plant tolerance to early drought stress was then evaluated in field trials in 2 independent years using nine inbred lines with contrasted root growth ( slow, intermediate, and fast primary root growth ). Field trials were set up during the hot dry season ( March–June ) in 2018 and 2020. Seeds were sown and irrigation equivalent to a 30-mm rainfall was applied. Irrigation was then stopped to mimic an early drought stress episode and plant growth and ecophysiological parameters were analyzed for the following 6 weeks ( Supplementary file 1, Table S1 ). We then analyzed the correlations between primary root length, measured in the lab, and plant performance measured in field conditions. Principal component analyses revealed a covariation of early primary root growth and stay-green ( the % of leaves that remained green ) as well as the performance index of photosynthesis ( PI ) measured both in 2018 and 2020 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage, an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress ( R = 0. 95, p <0. 01; Figure 1C, D ). Hence, our field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination. We next studied the genetic determinants of primary root growth in pearl millet. First, the heritability of early primary root growth was analyzed using our paper-based segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a biparental population of pearl ( Deu et al., 2018 ). Heritability was estimated to be 0. 64, indicating that 64% of the variation in primary root length was due to genetic factors. Genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) was then performed on the same population to identify genomic regions controlling the trait. GWAS identified one region on chromosome 3 ( Figure 2A ) that explained 12% of the variation in primary root length. This region was further dissected using bulk segregant analysis (BSA ) on the biparent population to narrow down the interval to a 1. 5 Mb ( Figure 2B ). Resequencing and re-annotation of this region revealed a glutaredin-encoding gene, PgXC as a potential candidate ( Figure 2C ). The closest homolog in Arabidopsis, AtXY19, was functionally characterized and shown to regulate root growth through cell elongation in the apical meristem ( Figure 3 ). The GRX gene family is conserved in pearl and Arabidopsis ( Figure 4 ) suggesting a conserved function in root elongation and resilience to drought in pearl millet. In conclusion, our study shows that fast-growing primary root is an adaptation to the Sahelian environment, particularly to early drought stress, and that increased root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to stress in field conditions. We identified a glutaredin-encoding gene, PgXC as a potential regulator of root growth through cellation in the apical meristem and conserved in pearl and Arabidopsis.

    Title: 
    Article: Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts, involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects, etc. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown. Here, the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context. First, across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. 
 Humans acquire, and process language in situated multimodal contexts, through dynamic interactions with their environment. For example, children may learn what the word ‘tiger’ means primarily via sensory-motor experience: they see one on TV, or they are told that a tiger looks like a big cat. Conversely, the experience required for understanding the more abstract concept of ‘good’ will likely include an evaluation of the rational and emotional motives underscoring intentional actions. Consequently, while more concrete concepts have external physical references ( they refer to objects or actions that are easily perceived in the world ), more abstract concepts do not necessarily have such references ( they generally refer more to cultural and societal constructs or peoples' inner states of mind ) ( Villani et al., 2019 ). Is this difference reflected in concrete and abstract representations in the brain during naturalistic processing? And are these static or can they change as a function of the multimodal contexts in which processing occurs? Most studies of concrete and abstract processing are not naturalistic in that they present words or sentences isolated from the rich contexts in which we usually process them. Collectively, these studies suggest that concrete and abstract concepts engage separate brain regions involved in processing different types of information. ( Bedny and Thompson-Schill, 2006; Binder et al., 2009; Sabsevitz et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2010; Vigliocco et al., 2014 ). Concrete words engage regions involved in experiential processing ( Barsalou et al., 2003 ). For example, motor-related cortices activate during the processing of action verbs like ‘throw’ ( Hauk et al., 2004 ), or action-related nouns like ‘hammer’ ( Vigliocco et al., 2006; Kiefer and Pulvermüller, 2012 ), auditory cortices for sound-related words like ‘telephone’ ( Goldberg et al., 2006; Kiefer et al., 2008 ), and visual cortices for color-related words like ‘yellow’ ( Hsu et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2007 ). These results are consistent with the view that we learn and neurobiologically encode concrete concepts in terms of the sensory and motor experiences associated with their referents. In contrast, some studies of abstract concepts have found greater activation in brain regions associated with general linguistic processing ( Binder et al., 2005; Mellet et al., 1998; Noppeney et al., 2004; Sabsevitz et al., 2005 ). These findings suggest that abstract concepts are learned by understanding their role in a linguistic context, including semantic relationships with other words ( e. g. ‘democracy’ is understood through its relationships to words like ‘people, ’ ‘parliament, ’ ‘politics, ’ etc., e. g. Jones et al., 2012 ). However, neurobiological data also support the view that subcategories of abstract concepts retain sensorimotor information ( Harpaintner et al., 2022; Harpaintner et al., 2020; Harpaintner et al., 2018; Fernandino et al., 2022 ) as well as social information ( Villani et al., 2019; Conca et al., 2021a ) and internal/interoceptive/affective experiences ( Oosterwijk et al., 2015; Vigliocco et al., 2014 ), which are also important for learning abstract concepts ( Ponari et al., 2018 ). Thus, abstract concepts constitute a more heterogeneous category ( Roversi et al., 2013; Zdrazilova et al., 2018; Villani et al., 2019; Muraki et al., 2020; Muraki et al., 2020; Kiefer et al., 2022 ). A limitation of these studies is that they have only investigated the processing of decontextualized concepts ( see e. g. Table 1 in a recent review by Del Maschio et al., 2022 ). That is, they ( often implicitly ) assume that conceptual representations in the brain are the product of a stable set of regions processing different types of information depending on whether a concept is concrete or abstract. However, this dichotomy may not account for the way in which we typically process concepts ( Lebois et al., 2015 ), given that the information encoded during conceptual processing depends on the contextual information available. For example, the situated ( i. e. contextualized in the discourse but also in the physical setting in which processing occurs ) processing of concrete concepts like ‘chair’ could be linked to many abstract internal elements like goals ( ‘I want to rest’ ), motivations ( ‘I have been standing for 2 hr’ ), emotions ( ‘I would like to feel comfortable’ ), and theory of mind ( ‘is that older person more in the need of this chair than me? ’ ). Conversely, an abstract concept like ‘truth’ is no longer particularly abstract when used in reference to a perceived physical situation ( such as ‘snowing’ ) that matches the utterance’s meaning ( ‘it is true that it is snowing’ ). Here, ‘truth’ refers to a concrete state of the world ( Barsalou et al., 2018 ). Indeed, previous work has postulated flexible conceptual processing in experiential brain circuits ( Binder and Desai, 2011; Pulvermüller, 2018a ). Behavioral data support the view that contextual information can affect conceptual processing ( e. g., Chambers et al., 2004; Cooper, 1974; Tanenhaus et al., 1995 ). For example, when an object is depicted in a visual context consistent with its use, the action associated with using the object is more readily available than when the context is more consistent with picking the object up ( Kalénine et al., 2014 ). There is also neurobiological evidence that objects visually present in a situation can influence conceptual processing ( Hoffman et al., 2013; Yee and Thompson-Schill, 2016 ). For example, task-related color-congruency of objects correlates with less activation of brain regions involved in color perception during processing – likely because less retrieval of detailed color knowledge was necessary ( Hsu et al., 2011 ). Dynamic, context-dependent recruitment of visual and motor-related areas during semantic processing has also been established ( Hoenig et al., 2008; van Dam et al., 2012; Popp et al., 2019 ). An understanding of conceptual knowledge as static and context-independent is insufficient to account for these dynamics ( Pulvermüller, 2018b ). However, no previous study has addressed whether the brain areas associated with concrete and abstract concepts are fixed or recruited in a more dynamic way during semantic processing. The present study aims to fill this gap and test the following two predictions. First, we submit that results from previous investigations of conceptual processing, which generally depict a stable dichotomy between concrete and abstract words, reflect the average experiential information of the type of situational context in which concepts are habitually experienced. Therefore, we predict that the neurobiological representation of concrete concepts, will be related to associated brain regions, because they retain experiences related to their physical referents that are predominantly characterized by sensory and motor information, ( Pulvermüller, 2018b; Willems et al., 2010 ). In contrast, because their representations mostly reflect information related to internal/interoceptive/affective experience as well as linguistic information, we expect abstract concepts to activate brain regions associated with emotional, interoceptive, and general linguistic processing ( Reinboth and Farkaš, 2022 ). Second, the reviewed work also suggests that these habitual representations are not necessarily stable and might change during naturalistic processing depending on the specific contextual information available. We specify two context conditions: a concept is displaced if its context offers little or no visual information related to the concept’s external sensory-motor features. In contrast, a concept is situated, if its visual context contains objects related to its meaning. We predict that when a concrete concept is processed in displaced situations ( e. g. ‘cat’ processed when discussing the general character traits of cats vs dogs ), the activation will resemble that of abstract processing. Conversely, when a concept is situated ( e. e. ‘cat’ when looking at a picture of a cat ) the activation will resemble that of concrete processing.

    Title: 
    Article: Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. 
 Despite success with cancer immunotherapies, approved immunotherapies are not available for the majority of cancer patients and only a minority of treated patients realize a durable response ( Haslam and Prasad, 2019; Ben-Aharon et al., 2018; Darvin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2023 ). Current studies largely focus on discovering new agents and identifying patients most likely to benefit from existing immunotherapies ( Kraehenbuehl et al., 2022 ). While many studies correlate tumor insertion and deletion ( indel ) mutation load with immunotherapeutic response, not all tumors with high indel mutational loads respond to checkpoint inhibitors ( Mandal et al., 2019; Turajlic et al., 2017; Yarchoan et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2019; Van Allen et al., 2015; Samstein et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2022; Rizvi et al., 2015 ). The typical adult solid tumor contains a median of 54 coding somatic nucleotide variants, many of which have the potential to create novel neoantigens or Mutation-Associated NeoAntigens ( ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020; Vogelstein et al., 2013; Segal et al., 2008 ). Approximately 5% of mutations are insertions/deletions ( indels ) or splice site changes that alter the open reading frame of the transcript ( ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020; Vogelstein et al., 2013; Segal et al., 2008 ). This subset of mutations is of particular interest because they can result in proteins and derived peptides that are foreign to a host’s healthy cells, giving rise to neoantigens ( Lindeboom et al., 2019; Pastor et al., 2010; Nogueira et al., 2021 ). In normal cells, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) plays an important role in messenger RNA ( mRNA ) quality control, as well as normal gene expression ( Frischmeyer and Dietz, 1999; Mendell et al., 2004; Carrard and Lejeune, 2023; Sun and Chen, 2023 ). In cancer cells, however, NMD may aid immuno-evasion by eliminating RNA transcripts coming from genes that carry truncating mutants ( Nogueira et al., 2021 ). This prevents translation and presentation of peptides from these proteins on major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I complexes, rendering them invisible to immune cells ( Dalton et al., 2019 ). Previous work has shown knockdown of the NMD pathway with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) enhances the anti-tumor immune response ( Pastor et al., 2010; Castle et al., 2014 ). Analysis of cell lines with loss of the UPF1 RNA helicase and ATPase gene ( UPF1 ), a key mediator of NMD degradation, also showed increased levels of aberrant transcripts and mutant proteins in the alleles targeted by NMD ( Oka et al., 2021 ). This is reminiscent of the pharmacological modulation of splicing, which has also been shown to increase the number of neoantigens present on the cancer cell surface due to similar underlying mechanisms ( Lu et al., 2021 ). Despite early studies showing little toxicity with NMD inhibition, there is as of yet no reports of a specific chemical inhibitor of the pathway with good bioavailability ( Martin et al., 2014; Durand et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2022; Gotham et al., 2016; Gopalsamy et al., 2012 ). In this work, we create a cell-based high-throughput assay to query the effects of a curated library of small molecules on NMD function. From this screen, we identify a lead compound capable of inhibiting NMD and ascertain its protein target as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -related kinase ( SMG1 ), a kinase that is a critical mediator of NMD. As the lead compound produced unacceptable toxicity in animal models, we then designed a specific and bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of SMG1 ( KVS0001 ) that is well-tolerated in vivo. We then demonstrate that targeted inhibition of SMG1 by KVS0001 leads to the presentation of novel neoantigens identifiable by T-cells leading to tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. 
 To develop an assay to find NMD inhibitors, we identified isogenic cell lines with out-of-frame indel mutations, hereinafter referred to as truncating mutations, targeted by NMD activity ( Supplementary file 1 ). We previously reported a panel of non-cancerous cell lines in which 19 common tumor suppressor genes were inactivated using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ( CRISPR ) –Cas9 system ( Cook et al., 2022 ). Through evaluation of this panel, we discovered two genes, Stromal Antigen 2 ( STAG2 ) and Tumor Protein p53 ( TP53 ), which did not express their expected proteins when assessed by western blots ( STAG2 ) or immunohistochemistry ( TP53 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Because the inactivation of these two genes was the result of frameshift mutations, we suspected that the absence of the proteins was due to NMD. This suspicion was supported by whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Cook et al., 2022 ). Notably, we saw an average decrease of STAG2 RNA transcripts by 20-fold and TP53 by 6-fold relative to their respective wild-type transcripts in the parental cell lines. We selected two STAG2 knockout clones ( clones 2 and 8 ) and one TP53 knockout clone ( clone 221 ) derived from the Retinal Pigmented Epithelial ( RPE1 ) cell line to design a high-throughput screen ( HTS ). Treatment with the canonical protein synthesis inhibitor emetine, working indirectly to inhibit NMD, demonstrated up to a 60-fold recovery of mutant RNA transcript expression, establishing this panel as appropriate for HTS ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3; Carter et al., 1995 ). We then designed a next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) assay for NMD ( Figure 1A ). We mixed the three cell lines in equal proportions and plated the mixture in 96-well plates followed by treatment with one compound ( drug ) per well. We determined NMD inhibition efficacy by comparing the wild-type and truncating mutant transcript expression levels in a ratiometric manner. Specifically, the wild-type sequences of the reciprocally knocked out clone ( i. e., wild-type STAG2 sequence from the TP53 knockout clones, and wild-type TP53 sequence from the STAG2 knockout clones ) served as internal references, providing a ratiometric assay of mutant to wild-type transcript abundance. This ratiometric assay minimized confounders introduced by nonspecific transcriptional activators or generally toxic agents. The use of three cell lines with different truncating mutations from two different target genes minimized the possibility that drugs identified in the HTS were cell line clone or mutation specific. Note that the use of these cell lines, carefully mixed, banked, and preserved, did not substantially increase the amount of time or work required to screen a single-cell line. A combination of well and plate barcodes allowed the pooling and scoring of over 1920 assays in a single NGS lane ( see methods ). Previous human clinical trials suggest that off-target toxicity at doses required for NMD inhibition makes emetine and other well-known NMD inhibitors unsuitable for human use ( Siddiqui et al., 1973; Moertel et al., 1974; Mastrangelo et al., 1973; Tang et al., 2013 ). We therefore, sought to identify a specific SMG inhibitor with good bioavailability. We used the HTS to query a library of 1,000 small molecules for SMG inhibition ( Figure 1B ) and identified K000 as a potent inhibitor of SMG ( Figure 1C ). K000 was selected for its ability to inhibit SMG phosphorylation of UPF1 ( Figure 1D ), a key mediator of NMD. K000 inhibited SMG phosphorylation of UP1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1E ) with an IC50 of 1 nM ( Figure 1F ). K000 did not inhibit other kinases tested in the library ( Figure 1— supplement 4 ). K000 was well-tolerated in vitro ( Figure 1— supplement 5 ) and in animal models ( Figure 1— supplement 6 ). We then designed a bioavailable SM1 inhibitor, KVS1 ( Figure 1G ). KVS1 inhibited SMG phosphorylation of UP1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1H ) with an IC50 of 1 nM ( Figure 1 ). K1 did not inhibit other kinases in the library ( Figure 1— supplement 7 ). K1 was well-tolerated in vitro ( Figure— supplement 8 ) and in vivo ( Figure— supplement 9 ). We tested the effect of K1 on the expression of ST2 and TP53 in RPE cells ( Figure 2 ). K1 increased ST2 and TP53 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ) with IC50 1 nM ( Figure 2 ) and 1 nM ( Figure 2 ) respectively. K did not inhibit other kinases in the library ( Figure— supplement 10 ). K was wellolerated in vitro (— supplement 11 ) and in vivo ( supplement 12 ). We then tested the effect of K on the presentation of neoantig on the surface of RPE cells ( Figure 3 ). K increased the presentation of neoant in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ) with IC50 1M ( Figure 3 ). K did not inhibit other kinases in the library (— supplement 13 ). K was welloler in vitro ( supplement 14 ) and in vivo ( supplement 15 ). Finally, we tested the effect of K on tumor growth in vivo ( Figure 4 ). K inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent ( Figure 4 ) with IC50 1M ( Figure 4 ). K did not inhibit other kinases in library ( supplement 16 ). was welloler in vitro ( supplement 17 ) in vivo ( supplement 18 ) 
The article discusses the development of a new compound, KVS1, that inhibits the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which is a cellular process that eliminates RNA transcripts from genes with truncating mutations, thereby preventing the presentation of neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells, making them invisible to the immune system. The compound was developed through a high-throughput screen of a library of 1,000 small molecules and identified as a potent inhibitor of SMG, a mediator of NMD. K1 was well-tolerated in vitro and in vivo and increased the expression of ST2 and TP53 proteins in RPE cells, and presentation of neoant on the surface of R cells, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The study provides new opportunities for studying N and diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

    Title: 
    Article: Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals. We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) -in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer. Using Cox regression models, we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374, 463 participants from the UK Biobank. We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers, PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual, and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ). Compared with biologically younger participants, those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1. 22 ( 95% confidence interval, 1. 18–1. 27 ) in men, and 1. 26 ( 1. 22–1. 31 ) in women, respectively. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2. 29 ( 2. 10–2. 51 ) for men and 1. 94 ( 1. 78–2. 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge. PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = –1. 01 in men, p<0. 001; Beta = –0. 98 in women, p<0. 001 ). Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 82230110, 82125033, 82388102 to GJ; 82273714 to MZ ) ; and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20220100 to MZ ). 
 Cancer continues to be the leading cause of death globally and the reduction of cancer-related deaths remains to be a public health priority ( Bray et al., 2018 ). The morbidity and mortality of cancer increase dramatically with age, which demonstrates that aging is the greatest risk factor for cancer ( Siegel et al., 2018 ). Although everyone gets older, individuals are aging at different rates ( Rutledge et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the variation in the pace of aging between person may reflect the differences in susceptibility to cancer and death. Thus, measurement of an individual’s biological age, particularly at the early stage of life, may promote the primary and secondary prevention of cancer through earlier identification of high-risk groups. Recently, Morgan and colleagues developed and validated a novel multi-system-based aging measurement ( Levine et al., 2018 ), PhenoAge, which has been shown to capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and strongly predict morbidity and mortality risk in diverse populations ( Kuo et al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2018 ). However, it is largely unknown whether PhenoAge can predict overall cancer risk and identify high-risk individuals for potential personalized prevention. To date, more than 2000 genetic loci have been identified as susceptibility markers for certain cancers by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) ( Buniello et al., 2019 ). Although the effect of these individual loci is relatively modest on cancer risk, a PRS combining multiple loci together as an indicator of genetic risk has been proved to effectively predict the incidence of site-specific cancer ( Dai et al., 2019; Lecarpentier et al., 2017; Mars et al., 2020 ). Recently, we systematically created site-specific cancer PRS for 20 cancer types, and constructed an incidence-weighted CPRS to assess the effect of genetic risk on overall incident cancer risk based on the UK Biobank ( Zhu et al., 2021 ). Previous studies had indicated an interaction between genetic factors and age on cancer risk ( Mavaddat et al., 2015 ). However, the extent to interaction between genetic factors and PhenoAge on overall cancer risk remained unclear. In this study, we calculated PhenoAge in accordance with the method described previously and then evaluated the effectiveness of PhenoAge in predicting the risk of overall cancer in the UK Biobank. We also assessed the extent to which a level of accelerated aging was associated with an increased overall cancer risk across groups with a different genetic risk defined by the CPRS. 
 The participants included in this study are derived from the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is a large population-based cohort study and detail protocol is publicly available ( Bycroft et al., 2018 ). In brief, approximately 500, 000 participants aged 40–70 were recruited from 22 assessment centers across England, Scotland, and Wales between 2006 and 2010 at baseline. Each eligible participant completed a written informed consent form and provided information on lifestyle and other potentially health-related aspects through extensive baseline questionnaires, interviews, and physical measurements. Meanwhile, biological samples of participants were also collected for biomarker assays and a blood draw was collected for genotyping. The UK Biobank study has approval from the Multi-center Research Ethics Committee, the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care in England and Wales, and the Community Health Index Advisory Group in Scotland ( http://www. ukbiobank. ac. uk/ethics/ ). We calculated PhenoAge in accordance with the method described previously ( Levine et al., 2018 ). Briefly, PhenoAge was calculated based on mortality scores from the Gompertz proportional hazard model on chronological age and nine multi-system clinical chemistry biomarkers ( albumin, creatinine, glucose, [log] C-reactive protein [CRP], lymphocyte percent, mean cell volume, red blood cell distribution width, alkaline phosphatase, and white blood cell count ) to predict all-cause mortality. The Biomarkers in the UK Biobank were measured at baseline ( 2006–2010 ) for all participants. To correct distribution skewness, we set the top and bottom 1% of values to the 99th and first percentiles. The formula of PhenoAge is given byPhenoAge=141. 50+ln-0. 00553×-1. 51714×exp⁡xb0. 00769270. 09165 wherexb=-19. 907-0. 0336×albumin+0. 0095×creatinine+0. 1953×glucose+0. 0954×lnCRP-0. 0120×lymphocytepercentage+0. 0268×meancorpuscularvolume+0. 3306×redbloodcelldistributionwidthRDW+0. 00188×alkalinephosphatase+0. 0554×whitebloodcellcount+0. 0804×age Finally, we calculated Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ), which was defined as the residual resulting from a linear model when regressing Phenotypic Age on chronological age. Therefore, PhenoAgeAccel represents Phenotypic Age after accounting for chronological age ( i. e. whether a person appears older [positive value] or younger [negative value] than expected, biologically, based on his/her age ). 55 independent PhenoAgeAccel-associated SNPs ( p<5 × 10–8 ) and corresponding effect sizes were derived from a large-scale PhenoAgeAccel GWAS including 107, 460 individuals of European ancestry ( Kuo et al., 2021a ). A PhenoAgeAccel PRS was created using an additive model as previously described ( Dai et al., 2019 ). In short, the genotype dosage of each risk allele for each individual was summed after multiplying by its respective effect size of PhenoAgeAccel. The calculation of site-specific cancer PRSs and the construction of CPRSs have been described in our previous published study ( Zhu et al., 2021 ). In brief, for individual cancer, risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and corresponding effect sizes were derived from the largest published GWASs in terms of sample size. Next, the dosage of each risk allele for each individual was summed after multiplication with its respective effect size of site-specific cancer. Except for nonmelanoma skin cancer and those without relevant GWAS or significant genetic loci published by now, we derived PRSs for 20 cancer types in this analysis. To generate an indicator of genetic risk for overall cancer, we constructed the CPRS as follows:CPRSi=∑k=1KhkPRSi, k Where CPRSi is the cancer polygenic risk score of ith individual, hk is the age-standardized incidence of site-specific cancer k in the UK population, and PRSi, k is the aforementioned PRS of site-specific cancer k. Given the different spectrum of cancer incidence between men and women, CPRS were constructed for males and females, respectively. We adopted five categories of genetic risk based on CPR : low, low, moderate, high, and very high risk. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between Pheno and PhenoAcc with overall cancer incidence in the UKobank. The model included Pheno, PhenoAcc, CPR, age, and interaction between Pheno and CPR as covariates. The HR and 95% CI were calculated for each category of Pheno, PhenoAcc, and interaction between Pheno and CPR. The interaction between Pheno and PhenoAcc was tested using likelihood ratio test. We also assessed the association between Pheno and Pheno with number of healthy lifestyle factors in the UKob using linear regression. The model included Pheno Pheno, Pheno, age, and interaction Pheno Pheno as covari. The interaction between Pheno and Pheno was tested using likelihood ratio test. The study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China ( 82210, 250, 82133, 881 02 G; 737 to MZ ) and the Excellent Foundation of Jiangsu Province (2020 to MZ ). 
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between Pheno and cancer risk in the UKob. We found that Pheno was associated with an increased risk of cancer in both men and women, with HRs of 1.22 and 1.26, respectively. The interaction between Pheno and genetic risk was also observed, with HRs of 2.29 and 1.94 for men and women with high genetic risk and older Pheno compared to those with low genetic and younger Pheno. Pheno was negatively associated with the number of healthy factors in men and women, Beta –.01 and –.98, respectively. Our results suggest that adherence to a healthy lifestyle may retard the aging process and reduce cancer risk. This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China and the Excellent of Jiangsu Province.

    Title: 
    Article: Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The Biome mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed >6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0. 9 ), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems. 
 Nature underpins human society, and the conservation of ecosystems and associated ecosystem services contributes to the sustainable development of human society, yet these services have been rapidly declining in recent years ( IPBES, 2019; Loh et al., 2005; Newbold et al., 2016; Scholes and Biggs, 2005 ). The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework ( KM-GBF ) by the United Nations envisions reversing the nature loss by 2030. As direct means for nature conservation, KM-GBF targeted making 30% of Earth’s land and ocean area as protected areas by 2030 ( i. e. 30 by 30 ). As an indirect but influential way, KM-GBF requires companies to “monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity through their operations, supply and value chains and portfolios, ” which is guided by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures ( TNFD ) ( TNFD, 2023 ). To achieve these goals, it is imperative to assess the state of biodiversity with a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to support conservation planning, adaptive management, and companies’ annual nature-related financial disclosures. The basis for such assessments lies in our knowledge of species distributions ( Gonzalez et al., 2023; Newbold et al., 2016 ). Traditionally, distribution data was acquired through on-site surveys by experts ( people have expertise about biodiversity ), but collecting distribution data with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution is challenging if we rely only on such limited human resources ( Miya et al., 2022; Mori et al., 2023; Pocock et al., 2018 ). Since the emergence of digital devices and the internet, people have been able to share their observations through various media, such as images and video/audio recordings. Such community-sourced data have significantly contributed to the accumulation of ecosystem information. These datasets have been instrumental in assessing the impacts of climate change and urbanisation on phenology ( Fuccillo Battle et al., 2022; Klinger et al., 2023 ), detecting distribution changes including invasive alien species ( Larson et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2023; Wallace and Bargeron, 2014 ), exploring large-scale geographic variations in traits ( Atsumi and Koizumi, 2017; Leighton et al., 2016 ), and estimating species distributions ( Chandler et al., 2017; Feldman et al., 2021; Johnston et al., 2018; Steen et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the utilisation of machine learning to describe population trends based on community-sourced data ( Fink et al., 2023 ) offers opportunities for conducting time-series analyses. These analyses can help us understand community assembly processes, unravel species interaction networks, and assess ecosystem stability ( Cornwell and Ackerly, 2009; Tilman et al., 2006; Ushio et al., 2018 ), capitalising on the spatiotemporally dense sampling effort facilitated by community-sourced data ( Chandler et al., 2017; Kobori et al., 2016; Pocock et al., 2017 ). Such analytical approaches enable us to make informed predictions about changes in species distribution, population dynamics, and ecosystem stability in the face of climate change ( Bury et al., 2021; Pennekamp et al., 2019; Urban et al., 2016 ). In essence, community-sourced data, owing to its extensive sampling across time and space, has the potential to test existing ecological theories, expand our comprehension of ecosystems and the underlying processes, eventually allowing us to forecast ecological dynamics in the context of climate change. When people photograph organisms using digital devices with GPS capabilities, the images often contain timestamps and location details. Such images, when accompanied by species identifications, serve as evidence for tracking phenology and species occurrences. This crowdsourcing approach has been particularly successful on web- or mobile-based platforms such as eBird and iNaturalist ( Chandler et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2011 ). Individuals submit records to these platforms for various reasons, including a desire to contribute to science and engage with cutting-edge technologies ( Herodotou et al., 2024; Kaplan Mintz et al., 2023 ). By making the process more enjoyable ( i. e. gamification ), we can potentially gather even more biological data from the public ( Bowser et al., 2013; Ponti et al., 2015 ). Yet, the collection process of Community-sourced data is usually not well-designed ( e. g. spatially biased ‘presence-only’ data ) ( Feldman et al., 2021; Steen et al., 2019 ) and its interpretation is challenging without proper statistical modelling. Thus, although much effort has been invested in developing effective monitoring and modelling methods for biodiversity assessment, current approaches can be further improved by incorporating ( i ) more enjoyable community-based survey platforms using mobile applications and ( ii ) employing an advanced statistical modelling framework in estimating species distribution. To fuel communities’ engagement in biodiversity surveys and environmental education, we launched the mobile application Biome in 2019 in Japan ( Fujiki and Tatsuno, 2021 ). For supporting species identification, Biome implements artificial intelligence ( AI ) algorithms that generate lists of potential species and enable users to seek help/suggestions from others for species identification ( Figure 1 ) as in other applications such as iNaturalist and eBird. The unique feature of Biome is gamification which offers enjoyable experiences and facilitates communication among users ( Fujiki and Tatsuno, 2021; Koide et al., 2023 ). For example, users can earn ‘points’ by contributing in various ways such as submitting records and suggesting species identifications to others, and their levels are determined based on the total points earned. The inclusion of networking and gamification elements can attract a wider user base, including those who may not typically engage in community science ( Bowser et al., 2013; Groom et al., 2021 ). Consequently, Biome has accumulated data rapidly. Since its launch, 6 million records have been collected through the app ( by 17 October 2023 ). This is more than four times greater than the number of records accumulated by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( GBIF ) from any data sources including iNaturalist and eBird during the same period in Japan ( ca. 1. 3 million ). The data gathered through the app has been used for conservation planning and facilitating companies' financial disclosures by supplying and analysing species occurrence records. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) are effective statistical tools for assessing biodiversity at specific sites while accounting for biases in survey efforts. SDMs use species occurrence records and environmental conditions to estimate the potential geographic ranges and suitable habitats for species ( Booth et al., 2014; Box, 1981; Elith et al., 2011; Hutchinson, 1957; Phillips et al., 2006 ). These models play a crucial role in conservation and restoration planning by helping predict how changes in land use and climate impact species distributions ( Kindt, 2023; Porfirio et al., 2014; Urban et al., 2016 ). While species presence/absence data—which needs extensive surveys by experts—is limited, presence-only data—which can be obtained from communities’ observations—is much more available. MaxEnt ( Phillips et al., 2006; Phillips and Dudík, 2008 ) is one of the most popular SDM methods due to its computational efficiency and estimation accuracy ( Valavi et al., 2022 ). It can estimate species distribution from presence-only data by maximising the entropy of the probability distribution while satisfying constraints based on the available information ( Elith et al., 2011; Phillips and Dudík, 2008 ). Since MaxEnt only requires occurrence records, it is well-suited for use with community-sourced data. In this study, we assessed the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance using MaxEnt. Species identification accuracy exceeded 95 for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Bi data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required 200 records for accurate models Boy index ≥0. 9, while blending the two sources reduced this to 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data compared to traditional biased towards natural areas may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions aiding in protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data will contribute to conserving and monitoring ecosystems.

    Title: 
    Article: Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts. 
 Congenital pulmonary cysts, resulting from abnormal fetal lung development, cause respiratory distress, infection, and pneumothorax in neonates. The dynamic pathogenic process and mechanisms are difficult to study in humans and few animal models are available. It is known that lung development begins with the specification of the respiratory domain in the ventral wall of the anterior foregut endoderm, as indicated by the expression of Nkx2-1, and the separation of the respiratory tract from the dorsal esophagus. The primary lung epithelial buds then undergo reiterated elongation and division to form the conducting airways ( branching morphogenesis ), followed by distal saccular formation and peripheral alveolarization to give rise to millions of gas exchange units ( McCulley et al., 2015; Morrisey and Hogan, 2010 ). This well-known process literally describes the growth of respiratory epithelium based on the extensive studies done in the past decades. It is notable that lung morphogenesis is a complex process relying on the highly coordinated development of both lung epithelium and lung mesenchyme. Evidence has increasingly suggested that lung mesenchymal lineages, including airway and vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ), pericytes, and stromal fibroblasts, are as important as epithelial cells in proper lung development ( Noe et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2015 ). In addition to acting as a mechanical framework that supports the formation of the bronchi, bronchioles, and the distal alveoli, the lung mesenchyme provides a microenvironment that regulates the growth of epithelium through a variety of morphogenic signals, such as Wnts, fibroblast growth factors ( Fgfs ), and bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) ( McCulley et al., 2015; Nikolić et al., 2018; Morrisey et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2018 ). BMPs are a family of growth factors that direct many biological processes, including organogenesis ( Wang et al., 2014 ). BMPs bind to the receptor complex of BMP receptor II ( Bmpr2 ) and BMP receptor I ( Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b ), which in turn activates the intracellular Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways ( Shi and Massagué, 2003 ). Mice with conventional Bmpr1a gene deletions are early embryonic lethal ( E7. 5–9. 5 ) before lung organogenesis ( Mishina et al., 1995 ). As reported by us and other groups, both hyperactivation and inhibition of BMP signaling in fetal lung epithelial cells result in lung malformation, which is primarily due to the defects in distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation ( Luo et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2008; Weaver et al., 1999; Bellusci et al., 1996 ). However, the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in regulating fetal lung development has not been studied due to the lack of lung mesenchyme-specific targeting tools in the past. We recently generated a lung mesenchyme-specific Tbx4 lung enhancer-driven loxP/Cre mouse driver line ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) which enables us to manipulate BMP signaling specifically in lung mesenchymal cells in vivo and to study its role in the lung development. Although Bmpr1a is expressed predominantly in fetal mouse lung airway epithelial cells at the early gestation stage ( embryonic day [E]12. 5 to E14. 5 ), its expression in fetal lung mesenchyme is also evident during mid-gestation ( Sun et al., 2008 ). Herein, we specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation. This pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation ( CPAM ). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases. 
 By crossing the Tbx4-rtTA/TetO-Cre driver line to the floxed-Bmpr1a mice ( Tbx4-rtTA/TetO-Cre/Bmpr1afx/fx ), Bmpr1a was specifically knocked out in the lung mesenchyme with doxycycline ( Dox ) induction from the beginning of lung formation ( E6. 5, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). This was validated at the mRNA and protein levels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C ). For example, in E15. 5 mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a conditional knockout ( CKO ), Bmpr1a immunostaining was absent in lung mesenchyme but present in the epithelia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) while Bmpr1a was detected in both mesenchyme and epithelia of wildtype ( WT ) lungs. By gross view with quantitative analysis ( Figure 1A–C ), early embryonic lung morphogenesis between Bmpr1a CKO lungs and WT controls was comparable prior to E13. 5. Decreased epithelial branching and increased size of branching tips were observed from E14. 5. As lung development progressed, the terminal airways in Bmpr1a CKO lungs displayed dilation and exhibited increasingly extensive cystic changes. However, the overall size of the lungs remained relatively unchanged. The dynamic change of the lung cysts in Bmpr1a CKO lungs was further analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) -stained tissue sections ( Figure 1D ). The walls of the lung cysts were lined with a single layer of epithelial cells, over the course of development, ultimately resulting in the formation of balloon-like cystic lesions by the end of gestation ( E18. 5 ). These findings were consistent with the overall morphology of the lungs. Interestingly, overall cell proliferation and apoptosis at E15. 5, when lung cysts were developed, had no significant change between cystic Bmpr1a CKO and WT control lungs as measured by EdU labeling and TUNEL assay, respectively ( Figure 1E–G ). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the aforementioned phenotypic changes, bulk RNA-seq was used to examine the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) between Bmpr1a CKO and WT lung tissues at E15. 5. A total of 1001 DEGs ( false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0. 05 and log2FC [fold change] ≥ 1 ) were identified, among which 547 genes were upregulated and 454 genes were downregulated in Bmpr1a CKO lungs as compared to the transcriptome of WT lungs ( Figure 2A ). The raw data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository under accession number GSE97946. Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis showed that lung mesenchymal Bmpr1a regulates a large number of genes involved in the Muscle System Process ( p<0. 001, Figure 2B ). As shown above in Figure 1, enlarged airways were initially seen in Bmpr1a CKO lungs from E14. 5. Whole mount staining of smooth muscle actin and comprehensive 3D imaging revealed a specific absence of airway SMCs surrounding the dilated airway branching in Bmpr1a CKO lungs, while unaffected airway branches in Bmpr1a CKO lungs remained surrounded by SMCs ( Figure 3A–C ). In addition, the subepithelial elastin fibers were reduced in the cystic airways of B1 CKO lungs ( Figure 3D–E ). These findings suggest that mesenchymal B1 plays a critical role in the development of airway SMCs and elastin fibers. To further investigate the role of mesenchymal B1 in airway epithelial development, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Sox9 proximal-distal axis in B1 CKO and WT lungs at E15. 5 ( Figure 3F–G ). Sox9 was ectopically expressed in the mesenchyme of B1 CK lungs, while Sox was downregulated in the distal epithelia of B1 CK lungs ( Figure 3F–G ). These results indicate that mesenchal B1 regulates the expression of Sox and Sox9 in airway epithelial cells. Smad1 and Sm5 are major downstream effectors of BMP signaling ( Shi and Massé,2003 ). We generated Sm1/5 double knockout ( Sm1/5DKO ) mice and crossed them with the T4-rt/Tet-C driver to delete Sm1/5 in lung mesyme ( Figure 4A ). However, Sm1/5 deletion did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in B1 CK lungs ( Figure 4B–D ). These findings suggest that Sm-independent mechanism contributes to the cystic lesions in B1 CK lungs. In conclusion, this study reveals the first the role of mesenchal BMP signaling in lung development and provides a potential mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

    Title: 
    Article: Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated. 
 Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for cell proliferation and differentiation ( Nyati et al., 2006; Olayioye et al., 2000 ). EGFR is subdivided into five regions: a large extracellular region, a single-spanning transmembrane I region, an intracellular juxtamembrane ( JM ) region, a tyrosine kinase region, and a C-terminal tail region ( Lemmon et al., 2014 ). After EGFR binds to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ), the extracellular region adopts conformations favoring the dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N terminus and the dimerization of the JM region ( Arkhipov et al., 2013; Ogiso et al., 2002 ), inducing the formation of asymmetric ( active ) dimers of the intracellular kinase region ( Red Brewer et al., 2009; Thiel and Carpenter, 2007; Zhang et al., 2006 ). This dimerization results in the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the tail region and the recruitment of intracellular signal proteins, such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) and phospholipase Cγ ( PLCγ ) containing Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and/or phosphotyrosine-binding regions ( Wagner et al., 2013 ). The JM region of EGFR plays a crucial role in the conformation-dependent coupling of EGFR’s binding to EGF and its activation and dimerization ( Endres et al., 2013; Jura et al., 2009b ). The JM region comprises a JM-A ( N-terminal half ) region, which can form an antiparallel helix dimer, and a JM-B ( C-terminal half ) region, which makes intramolecular contact with the kinase region ( Jura et al., 2009a ). Both these JM regions contribute to the stable formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer, which is important for kinase activation. Anionic lipid molecules in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane are implicated in the dimerization of the JM regions ( Hedger et al., 2015; Matsushita et al., 2013; McLaughlin et al., 2005 ). Multiscale molecular dynamic simulations have suggested that phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ) interacts specifically with the basic residues in the JM-A region, stabilizing the JM-A helices in an orientation away from the membrane surface by binding to PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ( Abd Halim et al., 2015; Matsushita et al., 2013 ). In addition to these in silico analyses, our recent in vitro study using nanodisc techniques suggested that phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 stabilize the conformation of the JM-A dimer ( Maeda et al., 2018; Maeda et al., 2022 ). Apart from these in silico and in vitro studies, the localization and roles of PS and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 during EGFR activation have not been fully investigated experimentally in living cells due to the difficulty of visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR in the plasma membrane. The main difficulty is that the proposed size of the lipid domain is below the diffraction limit of light. Therefore, conventional fluorescence microscopy cannot image the structure in detail. Superresolution imaging techniques that break the diffraction limit have become a powerful tool for visualizing cellular structures with unprecedented resolution ( Pujals et al., 2019 ). Among these techniques, single-molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ), which includes photoactivated localization microscopy, fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecular return, and direct STORM, allows the construction of super resolved images with high-precision localization of individual fluorophores ( Rust et al., 2006 ). Here, we visualized both the EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane with SMLM. We found that the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains and EGFR nanoclusters aggregate together before EGF stimulation. After stimulation, the degree of coaggregation decreases, which depends on PLCγ but not on phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ). The local PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR stabilizes EGFR dimers to increase EGFR autophosphorylation upon stimulation with EGF. The subsequent hydrolysis of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in the deactivation of EGFR. Our results suggest that autogenous remodeling of the lipid environments regulates EGFR activity. 
 To visualize the nanodomains of EGFR and the lipids in the plasma membrane simultaneously, we constructed a three-color SMLM analysis workflow ( see Methods, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). EGFR was fused with rsKame, a slow-switching Dronpa variant ( Rosenbloom et al., 2014 ), at the C-terminus. To exclude the effect of endogenous EGFR, we knocked out endogenous EGFR in HeLa cells, transfected them with EGFR–rsKame, and selected a cell line stably expressing the EGFR–rsKame fusion protein. When we stimulated the selected cell line with EGF, the EGFR–rsKame and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) in the cell line were phosphorylated to the same levels as in the parental HeLa cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B ), indicating that the EGFR–rsKame fusion protein functioned normally. To observe PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 with SMLM, the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-binding peptide PLCδ–PH was fused with a photoactivatable protein, PAmCherry1 ( Abe et al., 2012 ), and was transiently expressed in the cell line. To visualize PS with SMLM, the PS-specific peptide evectin-2 ( evt–2 ) –PH ( Uchida et al., 2011 ), tagged with HaloTag, was transiently expressed in the cell line, and was labeled with a spontaneous blinking dye, HMSiR ( Takakura et al., 2017 ). After the cells were fixed, sequential three-color SMLM was performed by imaging EGFR–rsKame illuminated with a 488 nm laser; PAmCherry1–PLCδ–PH ( hereafter ‘PAmCherry–PI ( 4, 5 ) P2’ ) activated with a 405 nm laser and illuminated with a 532 nm laser; and HMSiR–evt–2–PH ( hereafter ‘HMSiR–PS’ ) illuminated with a 637 nm laser ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). A single-molecule tracking analysis, drift correction, alignment of the color channels, image reconstitution, a multidistance spatial cluster analysis, and a G-function spatial map ( G-SMAP ) analysis were then performed automatically according to the workflow shown in the Methods section. EGFR–rsKame, PAmCherry–PI ( 4, 5 ) P2, and HMSiR–PS were distributed nonrandomly in the plasma membrane ( Figure 1A ). The G-SMAP analysis revealed that EGFR, PI ( 4 5 )2, and PS nanodomains coaggregated before EGF stimulation ( Figure 1B ). After EGF stimulation, the coaggregation of EG and PI 4 5 P decreased ( Figure 1C ). The decrease in coaggregation depended on PLC but not PI3K ( Figure 1D and E ). To investigate the role of PI 4 5 P in EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation, we reduced the PI 4 5 content in the plasma membrane by transiently transfecting cells with a PI 4 5 phosphatase inhibitor, myo-inositol 1,4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase inhibitor 1 ( IPPI ). The reduction in PI 4 5 decreased the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EG after EGF stimulation ( Figure 2A and B ). Inhibition of PI 4 5 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased the phosphorylation of EG–Thr654 ( Figure 2C ). These results suggest that PI 4 5 around EG stabilizes EG dimers and increases autophosphorylation upon EGF stimulation and that hydrolysis of PI 4 5 by PLC plays a role in deactivation of EG.

    Title: 
    Article: Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms, including multicellular algae, the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as the potato blight Phytophthora, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ). In contrast, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. 
 Glycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway that most organisms use to obtain energy from the oxidation of sugars, which consists of 10 enzymatic reactions in total, divided into two phases. The first ‘preparatory’ phase consists of five reactions, the products of which are the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The second ‘pay-off’ phase leads to the production of ATP, NADH, and pyruvate, which is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( Bricker et al., 2012; Herzig et al., 2012 ). In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a cytosolic process with the exception of trypanosomes, where it is localized in the glycosomes ( Opperdoes and Borst, 1977 ). However, it was recently discovered that a large group of eukaryotes, the stramenopiles, have a branched glycolytic pathway in which the pay-off phase is duplicated and also localized in mitochondria ( Abrahamian et al., 2017; Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). The stramenopiles are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group consisting mainly of protist algae, which are among the most important primary oxygen producers in the oceans ( Burki et al., 2020 ). The group also includes multicellular algae ( kelps ) and the economically devastating oomycetes, such as Phytophthora infestans ( Jiang and Tyler, 2012 ), which causes potato blight, one of the major contributing factors of the Great Famine in Ireland in the late 19th century. The human gut protozoan Blastocystis also belongs to the stramenopiles. Despite more than 1 billion infected individuals worldwide ( Andersen and Stensvold, 2016 ), the public health significance of Blastocystis is debated. Blastocystis is often linked to patients with diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome ( Poirier et al., 2012 ), or inflammatory bowel disease ( Dogruman-Al et al., 2009 ). However, it is also frequently found in healthy individuals, and a few microbiome studies associated Blastocystis with higher microbial diversity ( Andersen et al., 2015; Audebert et al., 2016; Stensvold et al., 2022 ). The controversy may arise from the extreme genetic diversity of Blastocystis, which is classified into over 40 subtypes ( Andersen et al., 2015; Stensvold et al., 2023 ), and thus its influence on gut microbiota is likely to be subtype specific ( Tito et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, Blastocystis ST7-B, which was used in this study, is most frequently associated with pathogenic phenotypes ( Ajjampur et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2023; Stensvold et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2014; Yason et al., 2019 ) and was recently linked to a decreased microbial diversity in diarrheal patients ( Deng et al., 2022 ). The treatment of choice is metronidazole ( Stenzel and Boreham, 1996 ), but there have been reports of resistance ( Haresh et al., 1999; Mirza et al., 2011; Moghaddam et al., 2005 ), highlighting the need for new therapeutic interventions. Unlike other stramenopiles, Blastocystis has lost the cytosolic pay-off phase of glycolysis, consistent with the absence of a gene encoding a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). The only exception is the last enzyme of the pathway, pyruvate kinase, which was also identified as a cytosolic protein ( Lantsman et al., 2008 ). Blastocystis is an anaerobe ( Zierdt, 1991 ) with highly divergent mitochondria ( Stechmann et al., 2008 ). It has respiratory complexes I and II, but lacks the rest of the electron transport chain, as well as ATP synthase and mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers ( Gentekaki et al., 2017; Stechmann et al., 2008; Wawrzyniak et al., 2008 ). Therefore, Blastocystis relies mainly on glycolysis and fermentation for its metabolic energy requirements ( Müller et al., 2012 ). The transport of glycolytic intermediates across the mitochondrial inner membrane is necessary for the completion of glycolysis and is critical for the survival of the parasite. Glycolytic enzymes are powerful drug targets in parasites that are strictly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production. The structural differences between host and parasitic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase in Plasmodium falciparum have been studied with the aim of inhibiting glycolysis ( Bruno et al., 2014; Penna-Coutinho et al., 2011; Ravindra and Balaram, 2005 ). Similarly, inhibitors against phosphofructokinase in Trypanosoma brucei have a rapid effect on the parasite viability without inhibiting the host enzyme ( McNae et al., 2021 ). Understanding the unique aspects of parasite metabolism is crucial for the discovery of new drug targets. It is clear that the branched stramenopile glycolysis needs to be linked by a specific transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane, as the solute exchange between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix is tightly controlled ( Kunji et al., 2020; Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020 ). The mitochondrial carrier family ( SLC25 ) is the largest solute transporter family in humans ( Kunji et al., 2020 ). Its members facilitate the transport of nucleotides, amino acids, inorganic ions, keto acids, vitamins, and other nutrients across the mitochondrial inner membrane. All SLC25 members have a threefold pseudo-symmetric structure, evident at the sequence level by the presence of three conserved homologous repeats ( Saraste and Walker, 1982 ) and specific motifs important for their transport mechanism ( Ruprecht et al., 2019; Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020; Ruprecht and Kunji, 2021 ). Here, we report a stramenopile-specific group of transport proteins closely related to mitochondrial carboxylate carriers of the SLC25 family. We characterized one of these unique Blastocystis carriers, which has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Instead, this carrier can transport several glycolytic intermediates, including dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ), thus providing a previously undiscovered transport link between cytosolic and mitochondrial glycolysis. Since Blastocystis relies solely on mitochondrial glycolysis, the inhibition of this carrier might represent a promising way to treat this parasite. 
 The last enzyme of the cytosolic phase of glycol is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In Blastocyst lacks a cytosolic PF ( R Bárt et al, 2018 ) but has a mitochondrial PF in the matrix, which was identified in this study. The mitochondrial PF of Blastocyst is specific for fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, but not fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and fructose-1,6-bis-2phosphate, which are substrates of the cyolic PF. The mitochondrial PF of Blastyst is also different from the human SLC25A11 and dicboxyl carrier SLC25A10, which transport malate and oxutar respectively. The Blastocytic PF is unique in its specificity for fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisph and its localization in the mitochondrial matrix. The transport of glycol intermediates across the mitochondrial inner membrane is necessary for the completion of glycol and is critical for survival of the parasite. Glycol enzymes are powerful targets in parasites that are dependent on glycol for ATP production. The differences between host and paras glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase triosephosphate isom in Plasmod falcum have been studied to inhibit glycol ( Bruno et al 2014; Penn-Cinho et al 2011; Ravra and Bal 2005 ). Similarly, inhibitors against phosphructase in Trypanos bruce have rapid effect on parasite without inhibiting host ( McN et 202 ). Understanding unique parasite metabolism is crucial for new drug discovery. The branched stramenile glycol needs to be linked by specific in mitochondrial membrane as sol exchange between cytos and matrix is tightly controlled ( Kun 202; Rup and Kun 202 ). The carrier family SLC is largest in humans ( Kun 202 ) members transport nucleot amino acids inorganic ions keto acids vitamins and other across inner membrane. All SLC have threefold structure evident sequence conserved homolog repeats specific transport mechanism ( Rrecht et 201; Rrecht and Kun 202; Rrecht and Kun 202 ). Here we report stramenile group transport related carboxyl carriers SLC family characterized one unique Blastocyst which lost transport canonical mal and oxutar. Instead transport glycol intermediates dihydroacet phosphate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 3osphoglycer phosphoenpyruate P providing undiscovered link cytos mitochondrial glycol. Since Blastyst relies solely glycol inhibition might treat parasite.

    Title: 
    Article: We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies: at each locus, a deep learning model ( in this study, Sei ) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual. This score, defined as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ), replaces the original genotype in association studies. Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 3619 independent HFS–trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis. HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153 tissue–trait associations with strong biological interpretability, including ‘circadian pathway-chronotype’ and ‘arachidonic acid-intelligence’. Lastly, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores, which showed an improvement of 16. 1–39. 8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits. 
 Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have witnessed remarkable advancements over recent years, both in terms of sample size and genetic discovery. However, the elucidation of downstream mechanisms and subsequent applications still face certain limitations ( Visscher et al., 2017 ). One caveat is that the statistical power of GWAS on a variant relies on its population frequency ( Li et al., 2020; Null et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022 ), whereas most variants with large effect size are rare ( Zeng et al., 2021 ), leading to insufficient discoveries. Moreover, linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) among neighboring variants can significantly inflate false positive results ( Nowbandegani et al., 2022 ). The variability of LD structure among different populations further compounds the challenges associated with training predictive models and discovering causal genes. Lastly, most trait-relevant variants reside in non-coding regions ( Watanabe et al., 2019 ), which lack direct functional annotations as coding variants. The prevalent approach to addressing this issue is to annotate each variant based on its location within functionally significant regions ( Finucane et al., 2015; Grotzinger et al., 2022; Iotchkova et al., 2019; Weissbrod et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2022 ), such as transcription factor-binding sites or enhancers. While this strategy has considerably advanced the analysis, it is not optimal, as a variant’s placement within a functionally important region does not inherently signify that the variant has substantial functional impacts. The central dogma, proposing that DNA alterations’ effects on phenotype are mediated via RNA and protein changes, offers a novel strategy to address these challenges. More precisely, by replacing the original genotypes in association studies with the aggregated impact of variants on transcription or functional genomics, the central dogma ensures the preservation of the majority of genetic information. This ‘aggregated impact’ offers several benefits for GWAS analysis: it provides direct biological interpretations, bypasses the effects of LD and population genetic history, and amalgamates information from both common and rare variants. One successful implementation of this strategy is Polygenic Transcriptome Risk Scores ( PTRS ) ( Hu et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022 ), which employ genetically determined transcription levels rather than genotypes to predict complex trait, and achieved remarkable portability. Nonetheless, the accuracy of imputing transcription levels from genotypes, given the sample size of currently available cohorts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, GTEx ( Aguet et al., 2020 ), remains limited ( R2 around 0. 1 for most genes ) ( Barbeira et al., 2018 ). Thus, the performance of PTRS is yet to reach its optimal potential. Following the success of PTRS, we made one step forward to utilize functional genomics in this strategy. Compared with transcription levels, predicting genetically determined functional genomic levels has achieved much higher accuracy by multiple recent deep learning ( DL ) studies ( Avsec et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Kelley, 2020; Yan et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2018 ). These DL models utilize segments of the human reference genome as training samples, substantially increasing the sample size. Furthermore, functional genomics serve as a mediator between DNA and transcription, thus lessening the influence of non-genic factors such as the environment. Given these advancements, we propose that using the outputs of one of the state-of-the-art DL models, Sei ( Chen et al., 2022 ), as the ‘aggregated impact’ in this novel strategy could effectively address the challenges aforementioned. Sei accepts a DNA sequence and computes multiple sequence class scores that represent different facets of the functional genomic activities of that sequence. This score integrates impacts from all variants, even those as rare as singletons, into one continuous variable, and is, in theory, unaffected by LD. In line with this notion, a recent similar strategy called cistrome-wide association study integrated variant–chromatin activity and variant–phenotype association to boost power of genetic study of cancer ( Baca et al., 2022 ). In this study, we present an analytical framework founded on this strategy ( Figure 1 ) and implement it on complex traits in the UK Biobank to pinpoint causal loci and genes, decipher biological mechanisms, and devise cross-ancestry prediction models. We segmented the human reference genome into multiple 4096 bp loci, generated DNA sequences for each locus for two haplotypes per individual, and employed Sei to compute the functional genomic activities of these sequences. We designated this activity score as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ) and analyzed the association between the HFS and each trait. Our findings confirm that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods, thereby demonstrating its value in genetic association studies. 
 We used the HFS framework to analyze imputed genotype data from the UK Biobank ( Figure 1 ). We segmented the human genome ( hg38 ) into 617, 378 discrete, non-overlapping loci, each 4096 base pairs long. Of these, 590, 959 loci carried at least one non-reference haplotype in the UKB cohort ( see Method and Supplementary file 1a ). After quality control, these loci contained approximately 1. 2 billion haplotypes, with a median count of 819 per loci ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We then employed the DL framework, Sei ( Chen et al., 2022 ), to compute sequence class scores for each haplotype. In its sequence mode, Sei accepts DNA sequences in fasta format and produces multiple distinct sequence class scores, 39 of which were included in our study ( Method ). Our analysis identified significant variation in sequence class scores across different loci. In fact, 49. 7% of loci housed haplotypes whose sequence class ( as defined by the maximum of the 39 sequence class scores ) differed from the reference haplotype sequence class. Using the reference sequence class as a benchmark, we noted that 16. 8% of loci showed a difference between the maximum and minimum haplotype scores that surpassed the score of the reference haplotype. Moreover, the correlation between sequence class scores of adjacent loci was low, with a median R2 value of 0. 013 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ), effectively reducing the impact of LD in association studies. Further evaluation indicated that this low LD was led by two factors: integration of rare variant impacts and segmentation. Firstly, excluding rare variants from HFS caused the LD raised to median = 0. 14 ( Method; Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ). Secondly, median LD of SNPs from adjacent loci was 0. 06, which was significantly higher than HFS LD ( paired Wilcoxon p = 1. 76 × 10−5 ) but significantly lower than HFS LD without rare variants ( paired Wilcoxon p < 2. 2 × 10−16 ). Expanding on the sequence class scores, we defined HFS for each locus. Specifically, we computed the mean sequence class score of two haplotypes per individual, reflecting an additive model. We selected the score corresponded to the sequence class of reference sequence as the HFS of the corresponding locus, and its association with each trait was computed using a generalized linear model. Simulation analysis revealed that when a non-reference sequence class score was associated the trait, reference class score could still capture median 70% of HFS–trait association R2. We applied this framework to 14 polygenic traits in the UKB British ancestry training set ( n = 350, 587; Supplementary file 1b and Method ), identifying 16, 597 significant HFS–trait associations at a threshold of p < 5 × 10−8 ( n = 15 for insomnia, n = 7573 for body mass index BMI ). Of these associations, 361 were independent ( Figure 2 ), corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with SNP-based analysis ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). The top 10 HFS–trait associations are listed in Table 1, with the most significant association for insomnia ( p = 1. 2 × 10−14 ). We also observed that 9 of the top 10 HFS–trait associations were in non-coding regions ( Figure 2— supplement 2 ). Fine-mapping revealed 9 causal associations corresponding to the top 10 HFS–trait ( Figure 2— supplement 3 ), with a median causal effect size of 0.1 ( Figure 2— supplement 4 ). The top 9 causal associations are listed in Table 2, with the most significant for insomnia ( p = 1.2 ×10−14 ). We also observed that 8 of the top 9 causal associations were non-coding ( Figure 2— supplement 5 ). The HFS enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153–trait associations with biological interpretability ( Figure 3 ), including ‘circadian rhythm-chronotype’ and ‘aridonic acid-intelligence’ ( Figure 3— supplement ). Lastly, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS score with SNP-based polygenic scores, which showed an improvement of 16.1–39.8 in crossance polygenic prediction ( Figure 4 ). We conclude that H is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.
The article proposes a new framework for genetic association studies, called the Haplotype Function Score (HFS), which uses a deep learning model to calculate the functional activity of haplotypes for each individual. This score replaces the original genotype in association studies and is applied to 14 traits in the UK Biob, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping reveals 9 causal associations, corresponding to a median of 63 causal per trait compared to SNP-based analysis. H-based analysis uncovers 727 pathway-trait and 153-trait associations with biological interpretability, including 'circadian-chronotype' and 'arid acid-intelligence'. LASS regression integrates FS score with SNP-based polygenic scores, showing an improvement of 16.1-39.8 in cross-ance poly prediction. The study suggests that FS is a promising for understanding the genetic of complex traits.

    Title: 
    Article: The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis, impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure, function, and behavior. The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing ( a ) attention-based mindfulness, ( b ) socio-affective, or ( c ) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress. We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults. We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume ( CA1-3 ) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills ( Affect module ), as compared to socio-cognitive skills ( Perspective module ) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills. Furthermore, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, using a multivariate approach, we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults. 
 Stress-related disorders rank among the leading causes for disease burden world-wide ( GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2016 ), and the global stress load has increased even more dramatically in recent years ( Brooks et al., 2020; Robillard et al., 2020 ). It is therefore essential to find ways to efficiently prevent or reduce stress ( Jorm et al., 2017 ). In recent years, research has shown that contemplative mental training programs can be efficient in stress reduction ( Puhlmann et al., 2021b; Engert et al., 2023; Engert et al., 2017; for a meta-analysis see Khoury et al., 2015 ), while simultaneously inducing brain plasticity ( Valk et al., 2017; Pernet et al., 2021; Davidson, 2016 ). It is, however, still unclear which types of mental practices are most efficient in reducing stress and inducing stress-related brain plasticity. Furthermore, stress is a multi-layered construct ( Engert et al., 2018 ), and most studies focused on stress-related self-reports and questionnaires ( Khoury et al., 2015 ). A less investigated marker in the stress reduction context through contemplative mental training is diurnal cortisol, from which summary indices such as the cortisol awakening response ( CAR ), the total diurnal output and the diurnal cortisol slope are frequently investigated ( Ross et al., 2014 ). The steroid hormone and glucocorticoid cortisol is the end-product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis and a key player in stress regulation ( for reviews see e. g., Chrousos, 2009; Sapolsky, 2000a ). Moreover, cortisol is considered an important mediator of the relation between chronic stress and stress-related disease ( Adam et al., 2006; Miller et al., 1995 ). Previous research suggests an association between hippocampal structural integrity and stress-related cortisol activity ( McEwen et al., 2016; McEwen, 1999 ), although findings are inconclusive. To close these gaps, we here investigate the differential efficiency of three types of mental training ( attention-based, socio-affective and socio-cognitive ) on their ability to induce structural as well as functional plasticity of hippocampal subfields and reduce diurnal cortisol levels. The hippocampus has a high glucocorticoid receptor density ( Herman and Cullinan, 1997; Herman et al., 1995; Jacobson and Sapolsky, 1991; McEwen, 2013 ), making this region a target of investigations into stress-related brain changes. Having a three layered allocortex, the hippocampal formation consists of multiple subfields, or zones, starting at the subiculum ( SUB ) and moving inward to the hippocampus proper, the cornu ammonis ( CA1-3 ), and dentate gyrus ( CA4/DG ) ( Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2020; Wisse et al., 2017; Yushkevich et al., 2015; DeKraker et al., 2018 ). These subfields have unique microstructure ( Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2020; Wisse et al., 2017; Yushkevich et al., 2015; DeKraker et al., 2018; Paquola et al., 2020 ) and participate differently in the hippocampal circuitry ( de Flores et al., 2017 ), likely implicating different functional contributions ( Hodgetts et al., 2017; Berron et al., 2016; Plachti et al., 2019; Genon et al., 2021; Olsen et al., 2012; Vos de Wael et al., 2018 ). Indeed, intrinsic functional MRI analyses have shown that the hippocampal subfields show functional correlation with a broad range of cortical regions, part of visual, control, and default functional networks ( Paquola et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2018; Bayrak et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2019; Przeździk et al., 2019 ). Hippocampal subfield volumes and associated intrinsic functional connectivity have been shown to be heritable ( Bayrak et al., 2022; Whelan et al., 2016 ), indicating that individual variation in subfield structure and function is, in part, under genetic control. Other lines of research have reported hippocampal structure and function to be highly sensitive to contextual factors, such as stress ( McEwen, 2013 ). Mediated through its dense network of glucocorticoid receptors, the hippocampus transmits the negative feedback signals of a wide range of glucocorticoid levels on HPA axis activity ( Jacobson and Sapolsky, 1991 ). Through this inhibitory role on HPA axis dynamics, it is linked to emotional reactivity ( Phelps, 2004 ), stress sensitivity ( McEwen, 1999; Bannerman et al., 2004; Franklin et al., 2012; Pruessner et al., 2010 ), and causally involved in a variety of stress-related disorders ( O’Doherty et al., 2015 ). Previous brain imaging research has examined the relationship between cortisol activity and hippocampal structure and function. Most of this research measured saliva cortisol levels to gauge the diurnal cortisol profile. Thus, a reduced cortisol awakening response, the response to the anticipated demands of the upcoming day ( Fries et al., 2009 ), has been associated with smaller hippocampal volume in healthy individuals ( Pruessner et al., 2007; Pruessner et al., 2005; Bruehl et al., 2009 ) and different psychiatric ( Dedovic et al., 2010; Dedovic et al., 2009 ) and metabolic ( Bruehl et al., 2009; Ursache et al., 2012 ) conditions. In fact, the examination of patients with temporal lobe damage suggested that hippocampal integrity may be a necessary condition for the proper mounting of the CAR ( Buchanan et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2005 ). Next, to changes in hippocampal structure, alterations in hippocampal functional connectivity have been reported to be associated with changes in cortisol levels ( Hakamata et al., 2019; Chang and Yu, 2019 ). There is also contrary work showing associations between elevated awakening, evening, diurnal, or 24 hour cortisol levels in healthy elderly with age-related hippocampal atrophy ( Knoops et al., 2010; Lupien et al., 1999; Lupien et al., 1998; Sudheimer et al., 2014 ) and, again, samples with psychiatric conditions ( Gold et al., 2010; Mondelli et al., 2010 ). While such inconsistencies in previous neuroimaging work may reflect the fact that different indices of diurnal cortisol tap different facets of HPA axis regulation, the samples studied have been diverse in terms of health status, small in size, and largely cross-sectional. In addition, associations between stress and hippocampal structure and function over time are incompletely understood. Thus, longitudinal studies, such as mental training studies aimed at stress reduction that repeatedly assess both brain and cortisol release, may help to better understand the dynamic relationships between stress, cortisol, and hippocampal structure and function. In recent years, contemplative mental training interventions, such as mindfulness and meditation, have been shown to reduce stress ( Puhl et al,202b; Engert et al,202; Engert et al,201 ) and induce brain plasticity ( Valk et al,2017; Pernet et al,202; Davidson,2016 ). However, it is unclear which types of mental practices are most efficient in reducing stress and inducing stress-related brain plasticity Furthermore, stress is a multi-layered construct ( Engert et,2018 ) and most studies focused on stress-related self-reports and questionnaires ( Khour et,2015 ) less investigated marker in stress reduction through contemplative mental is diurnal cortisol, which indices such as the cortisol response, the diurnal output the diurnal slope are frequently ( Ross,201 ) The hormone and glucocortic cortisol is end-product the hypothalamic-puitary ( H ) and key in stress regulation ( Chos,200; Sap,200a ) Moreover, is an mediator the between chronic stress stress-related disease ( Adam et,200; Miller,199 ) research suggests association between hippocal integrity and stress-related cortisol (Ewen,201;E,199 although are inconclusive To these gaps we investigate the efficiency three types mental ( attention, socio-affective socio-c ) their ability to induce structural well functional hippocal plasticity and reduce diurnal levels The hippoc has highocortic density ( Hermanull,199; Herman,199; Jacob,199; Mcwen,201 ) making region of investigations into stress-related changes Having three allocortex the hippocal formation multiple subfields or zones starting the subic ( ) moving inward the cornu ( CA- ) dent ( Paleroall et,202; Wisse,201; Yushvich,201; Deaker,201 ) these have unique structure Paleroall,202; Wisse201; Yushvich201; Deaker201; Paola202 participate differently the circuit Hodget,201; Berr201; Plach201; Gen202; Olsen201 Vael201 ) Indeed functional analyses shown that hippocal subfields correlation broad range cortical, control, networks ( Paola202; Vael201; Bay202 Zhong; Prźik201 ) subfield volumes associated functional been heritable Bay202; Whelan201 indicating variation structure function, part under control other research reported hippocal structure function sensitive contextual stress Mcwen mediated glucortic receptors transmits negative signals H axis ( Jacob199 ) inhibitory H dynamics linked emotional reactivity stress Mcwen199; Berman Franklin201; Pruess201 causally disorders O’Derty201 brain examined relationship cortisol hippocal structure function most measured saliva levels gauge diurnal profile reduced awakening response associated smaller hippocal healthy Pruess Prner200; Pr200 Brhl200 Dedovic200;200 Brhl200 Ursache201 examination patients lobe suggested integrity necessary mounting CAR Buchanan200; Wolf200 Hakata201; Chang Yu201 associations elevated evening diurnal 24 hour levels healthy age-related atrophy Kops201 Lupien199; Lup199 Sudheimer201 psychiatric Gold201 Mondelli201 inconsistencies neuroimaging different indices facets H axis samples diverse status small cross-sectional associations stress hippocal function time incompletely longitudinal studies repeatedly assess brain release may better understand relationships stress, cortisol, hippocal structure function. 
The study aimed to investigate the effects of three types of mental training on hippocampal structure and function and diurnal cortisol levels in healthy adults. The training types were attention-based, socioffective, and socio-cognitive. The results showed that the socioffective training increased bilateral cornu ammonis volume and functional connectivity compared to socio-cognitive and waitlist controls. Changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reductions in cortisol levels. Other subfields also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. The study provides a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal structure and function, and cortisol in healthy adults.

    Title: 
    Article: Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect, which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ). Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species. 
 The genetic basis of local adaptation is sometimes highly repeatable, with examples of large effect genes driving responses in multiple species, such as FT affecting flowering time in numerous plants ( Izawa, 2007; Auge et al., 2019 ) or Mc1r driving colour polymorphisms in vertebrates ( Manceau et al., 2010; Rosenblum et al., 2014 ). Local adaptation can also be repeated for polygenic traits, with significant patterns of similar association found across many loci for comparisons of conifers ( Yeaman et al., 2016 ), maize and its wild relative teosinte ( Tittes et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021 ), and Brassicaceae ( Bohutínská et al., 2021 ), to name a few. While we have a growing number of examples of repeatability in the basis of adaptation, it is also interesting to know if species use different genes to adapt to the same selection pressure. Genotypic redundancy – the potential for many genotypes to yield a given phenotype – is one critical factor affecting the repeatability of adaptation, as high redundancy would be expected to result in lower repeatability ( Yeaman et al., 2018 ). Another critical factor affecting repeatability is shared standing variation, whether present due to introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. In either case, variants shared among lineages are much more likely to contribute to a repeated response than new mutations ( MacPherson and Nuismer 2018; Ralph and Coop 2015 ). Consistent with this, Bohutínská et al., 2021 found that repeatability was negatively related to phylogenetic distance. While we are now accumulating more studies about the repeatability of adaptation, we still have very few examples and much remains unknown about the relative importance of these factors ( Yeaman, 2022 ). Inversions have been implicated in local adaptation in many species ( Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018 ), likely due to their effect to suppress recombination among inverted and non-inverted haplotypes, and thereby maintain linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) among beneficial combinations of locally adapted alleles ( Rieseberg, 2001; Noor et al. 2001; Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006 ). This has been approached by models studying the establishment of inversions that capture combinations of locally adapted alleles present as standing variation ( e. g. Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006 ), as well as models examining the accumulation of locally adapted mutations within inversions ( e. g. Schaal et al., 2022 ). If there is variation in the density of loci that can potentially contribute to local adaptation, inversions would be expected to preferentially establish and be retained in regions harbouring a high density of such loci ( and this expectation would hold for both the capture and accumulation models ). We would also expect to see stronger signatures of repeated local adaptation in such high-density regions. Despite mounting evidence of their importance in adaptation, it is unclear how inversions may covary with repeatability of adaptation among species. A fundamental parameter of importance in these models is the relationship between migration rate and strength of selection on individual alleles, which may not make persistent contributions to local adaptation without the suppressing effects of recombination if selection is too weak ( Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011; Bürger and Akerman, 2011 ). If most alleles have small effects relative to migration rate and can only contribute to local adaptation via the benefit of the recombination-suppressing effect of an inversion, then we would expect little repeatability at the site of an inversion – other species lacking the inversion would not tend to use that same region for adaptation because selection would be too weak for alleles to persist. On the other hand, if some loci are particularly important for local adaptation and regularly yield mutations of large effect, with these patterns being conserved among species, repeatability within regions harbouring inversions may be substantial. Thus, studying whether adaptation at the same genomic region harbouring an inversion is observed in other species lacking the inversion can give insights about the underlying architecture of adaptation, and the evolution and maintenance of inversions. Here, we explore the repeatability of local adaptation in three species of sunflowers, Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris ( Figure 1 ), which harbour large regions of suppressed recombination ( ‘haploblocks’ ), most of which are inversions, and are often associated with adaptive traits ( Todesco et al., 2020 ). H. annuus, the common sunflower, is the closest wild relative of cultivated sunflower, which was domesticated from it around 4000 years ago ( Blackman et al., 2011 ). Populations of H. annuus are distributed throughout the central and western United States and generally found on mesic soils, but can grow in a variety of disturbed or extreme habitats, such as semi-desertic or frequently flooded areas, as well as salt marshes. H. petiolaris, the prairie sunflower, prefers sandier soils, and ecotypes of this species are adapted to sand sheets and sand dunes ( Ostevik et al., 2016 ). Here we include samples from two subspecies: H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris, which is commonly found in the southern Great Plains, and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax, which is limited to more arid regions in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona ( Heiser et al., 1969 ). H. petiolaris and H. annuus have broad and overlapping distributions throughout the central and western United States and appear to have adapted to similar changes in temperature, moisture, and photoperiod regimes. There is also evidence indicating H. annuus and H. petiolaris have likely been exchanging genes during much of their history of divergence ( Strasburg and Rieseberg, 2008 ), although partially isolated by strong pre- and post-zygotic barriers ( Sambatti et al., 2012 ). The third species, H. argophyllus, the silverleaf sunflower, is found exclusively in the southeast coast of Texas and includes both an early flowering ecotype on the coastal barrier islands and a late flowering ecotype inland ( Moyers and Rieseberg, 2016; Todesco et al., 2020 ). H. argophyllus is thought to have undergone cycles of sympatry and allopatry with H. annuus and H. petiolaris over time, but currently only overlaps with H. annuus, with thus overlap likely being a recent event ( Heiser, 1951 ). Using broad sampling across the ranges of these species ( Figure 1 ) and sequencing data first published by Todesco et al., 2020, we study the genomic basis of local adaptation by conducting genome-wide scans for associations with climatic and soil environmental variables and phenotypes measured in a common garden. An inherent problem in studying the basis of local adaptation is accounting for the covariance between genome-wide population genetic structure and environment. When the selection pressure driving local adaptation tends to parallel a main axis of demographic expansion or isolation by distance, neutral alleles will have spatial patterns resembling those of causal alleles. Methods that do not correct for population structure have large numbers of false positives because allele frequencies at neutral loci tend to correlate with the environment more than expected by chance ( Lotterhos and Whitlock, 2014 ). By contrast, methods that use structure correction tend to suffer from false negatives because the causal loci have similar patterns of allele frequency variation as the genomic background, and so their statistical signatures are decreased ( DeRaad et al., 2021; Booker et al., 2023a ). When a non-corrected approach is applied to multiple species, the false-positive problem can be mitigated when testing for loci that contribute to adaptation in multiple species. Here, we use a combination of methods to account for population structure and correct for false positives. First, we use PCA to reduce dimensionality of the data and correct for population structure ( Figure 2 ). Second, we use a mixed model to account for population structure and correct for false positives ( Figure 3 ). Third, we test for loci that contribute to adaptation in multiple species ( Figure 4 ). Our results show that there is significant repeatability in the basis of adaptation among the three species, particularly in regions harbouring inversions ( Figure 5 and 6 ). This is consistent with the idea that inversions facilitate adaptation by suppressing recombination and maintaining linkage disequilibrium among locally adapted alleles. However, we also find that some loci contribute to adaptation without the benefit of recombination suppression, indicating that inversions are not the sole driver of local adaptation. The strongest signatures of adaptation tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for adaptation in these species. This is consistent with the idea that different species use different genes to adapt to the same selection pressure and that genotypic redundancy is a factor affecting repeatability of adaptation. We also find that repeatability is negatively related to phylogenetic distance, consistent with the idea that shared variation is more likely to contribute to repeated responses than new mutations. Our results have implications for understanding the evolution of inversions and their role in local adaptation, as well as the repeatability of adaptation among species. Inversions have been implicated in local adaptation in many species due to their effect to suppress recombination among inverted and non-inverted haplotypes and thereby maintain linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) among beneficial combinations locally adapted alleles ( Riese,2001; Noor et al 2001; Kirkpatrick and Barton,2006 ). This has been approached by studying the establishment of inversions capture combinations of locally adapted alleles as standing variation ( e. g. Kirkpatrick and Barton,2006 ) as well as examining accumulation locally adapted within inversions (. e. Schaal et,202 ) If is variation in the density of loc that can contribute to local, inversions would be expected to preferentially establish and be in regions harbouring a high of such loci and this would hold for both capture and accumulation models. We also expect to see stronger signatures repeated adaptation in high-density regions. However, it is unclear how inversions covary with repeatability adaptation among species. A parameter of importance in these models is the relationship between migration rate and strength of selection on individual alleles which may make persistent to local without suppressing effects recombination if is too weak ( Yeaman and Whit,201; Bürger Akerman,201 ) If alleles have small relative to migration rate can only contribute local via the benefit re-suppressing effect of inversion then we would little repeatab at the site of inversion other lacking inversion would not tend to use that region because selection would be weak for alleles to persist. On the other hand, if loci are important for local and yield large mutations effect these being conserved among species repeatab within inversions may be substantial. Studying adaptation at same region harbouring inversion in other lacking can give insights the underlying adaptation and evolution of inversions. Here we explore repeatab local in three species sunflowers Helthus annus, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar which harbour large regions suppressed recombination ‘haplocks’ most which are inversions and associated with adaptive traits. annu the common sunflower is closest relative cultivated which domesticated around 400 years ago (Blackman et,201 ) Populations ann are throughout central western United States and found mesic soils but grow variety disturbed habitats such as desert or flooded as well as marsh. petolar prairie sunflower prefers sand soils ecotypes adapted sand and dunes (Ostik et,201 ) We include two subspecies petolar

    Title: 
    Article: Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger <30 ( y ) ears old and older >55 y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility. 
 Organisms, organs, and tissues exhibit stereotyped aging phenotypes that represent the integration of accumulated, stochastically incurred damages to individual cells that result in commonly understood hallmarks of aging ( López-Otín et al., 2013; Todhunter et al., 2018 ). Stereotypical changes appear directional to the observer and are apparent at different physiologic scales, for example phenotypically though wrinkling, graying hairs, and increasing frailty; cellularly through increasing organ dysfunction, and loss of bone density, muscle mass and fat pads; and molecularly through decreasing levels of androgens and estrogens, and the upregulation or downregulation of gene or protein levels. Age-associated directional changes in transcriptomes of whole tissues are well documented ( de Magalhães et al., 2009; Glass et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2015; Volkova et al., 2005 ). These directional molecular changes explain, at least in part, the noticeable phenotypic changes that accompany aging. However, although increased susceptibility to a plethora of diseases, including cancers, is a prominent consequence of aging, the emergence and onset of diseases vary among same-aged individuals. Indeed, variance in gene expression between individuals arises in the contexts of tumors, diet, and aging ( Bashkeel et al., 2019; Brinkmeyer-Langford et al., 2016; de Jong et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2018; Viñuela et al., 2018 ). We propose that this variability among individuals may itself be an important molecular phenotype of aging, and individuals with outlier expression profiles provide an avenue for understanding biological processes that explain the differences in cancer susceptibility between individuals as they age. The breast is an excellent model system for examining aging at the cellular and molecular levels because normal tissue from individuals spanning the adult lifespan is available from common cosmetic and prophylactic surgeries. Cultured pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) support growth of breast epithelial cell lineages from women across the lifespan ( Garbe et al., 2009; Labarge et al., 2013 ) and enable detailed, reproducible molecular studies of cancer progression ( Stampfer et al., 2013 ). Moreover, there are well-established lineage-specific markers and cell-sorting protocols that facilitate experimentation at lineage-specific resolution. Furthermore, breast tissue provides an ideal model for studying aging-associated cancer susceptibility as 82% of new breast cancers are diagnosed in women ≥ 50 y ( DeSantis et al., 2019 ). Directional changes in gene expression with age have been reported in whole breast tissue, including changes associated with biological processes involved in breast cancer ( Lee and Lee, 2017; Yau et al., 2007 ). However, aging is also associated with significant shifts in proportions of breast cell lineages, including epithelial and stromal populations ( Benz, 2008; Garbe et al., 2012 ). Thus, it is unclear how tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging reflect changes in cell-intrinsic and microenvironment states. Lineage-specific analyses are needed to unravel such mechanisms. The mammary epithelium, the origin of breast carcinomas, is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages—myoepithelial cells ( MEPs ) and luminal epithelial cells ( LEPs ). MEPs are basally located and contractile and have tumor suppressive properties ( Pandey et al., 2010 ). Luminal epithelial cells ( LEPs ) are apically located and include subpopulations of estrogen receptor negative ( ER- ) secretory cells, which represent 80–95% of luminal cells in breast tissue, and ER positive cells ( ER+ ) ( Booth and Smith, 2006 ). We previously demonstrated loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia as an aging phenomenon—in which the faithfulness of expression of established lineage-specific markers diminishes with age without loss of the lineage-specificity of other canonical markers nor of the gross phenotypic and histological differences between LEPs and MEPs ( Miyano et al., 2017 ). Although our earlier work focused on a few select LEP-specific and MEP-specific markers, we hypothesized that the aging mechanisms we observed could impinge upon genome-wide maintenance of lineage fidelity and could thus be potential drivers of susceptibility to cancer initiation in breast tissue. Here, we demonstrate how age-dependent directional and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia and explain how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. Directional responses reflect stereotyped changes associated with upregulation or downregulation of gene expression between younger and older cohorts; variant responses reflect increases in gene expression variance within a cohort associated with the heterogeneity of individuals within a group. Through transcriptomic profiling of primary LEPs and MEPs, we found that loss of lineage fidelity in gene expression with age was a genome-wide phenomenon. We identified two models mediating loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia with age: ( i ) via directional changes identified through differential expression ( DE ) analysis; and ( ii ) via an increase in variances identified through differential variability ( DV ) analysis. Age-dependent DE explained part of the observed loss of lineage fidelity, while our model of the overall increase in variances with age also accounted for a comparable fraction of this loss. Directional changes in expression with age strikingly occurred almost exclusively in luminal cells, whereas changes in variance were found in both lineages. Genome-wide directional changes in gene expression in LEPs involved dysregulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1 with age. We also detected this dysregulation in bulk tissue that consist of all lineages of the stroma and epithelia. Loss of lineage fidelity led to enrichment of genes and biological processes commonly dysregulated in cancers, and altered the LEP-MEP interactome that was significantly modulated by apical cell-cell junction proteins, such as GJB6. Modulating GJB6 expression via shRNA in MEPs was sufficient to reduce the rate of molecular aging of adjacent LEPs as determined with a breast-specific biological clock. Using machine learning, we showed that genes that had age-dependent directional and variable changes in normal LEPs had predictive value in distinguishing normal breast tissue from breast cancers and in classifying breast cancer PAM50 subtypes. Age-dependent changes in LEPs reflected dysregulation of biological processes that are convergent with breast cancer. The degree and variability of age-dependent changes across individuals may explain the differential susceptibility between individuals to breast cancer initiation, and to the development of specific breast cancer subtypes. 
 Mammary glands are bilayer structures consisting of Keratin 19 ( KRT19 ) -positive LEPs surrounded by KRT14-positive contractile MEPs ( Figure 1A ). The luminal lineage is composed of ER+ hormone sensing and ER- secretory populations with ER- LEPs accounting for the vast majority of the luminal lineage independent of age ( Pelissier Vatter et al., 2018 ). To address the mechanism of age-associated loss of lineage fidelity, we used HMEC primary cultures from reduction mammoplasties ( RM ) that maintained the ER- LEP and MEP lineages from two age cohorts: younger <30 y women considered to be premenopausal ( mLEP = 16, mMEP = 16 samples; n=11 subjects; age range 16-29y ) and older >55 y women considered to be postmenopausal ( mLEP = 11, mMEP = 11; n=11; age 55-65y ). We analyzed transcriptomes of LEP and MEP from each cohort using RNA-seq and identified age-dependent changes in gene expression and increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to loss of lineage fidelity ( Figure 2 ). Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively in LEP and involved regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SAT1 Epithelial expression of gap junction protein G6 ( GJB ) increased with age, and modulation of G6 in heterochron co-cultures revealed it provided a conduit from MEP that drove change in L. Age-dependent LEP transcriptomes comprised a signal that could be detected in bulk during aging and transition into cancers. A machine classifier based on L-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer and was highly predictive of breast subtype. We speculate that LEP are the site of integration of variant responses in surrounding tissue and their emergent phenotype endows with ability to become cancer-cells-origin and represents biosensor presages cancer susceptibility

    Title: 
    Article: Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i. e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research. 
 Plant pests, such as pathogens and herbivores, can cause major yield losses in crops and often require the massive use of pesticides to control their damage. Natural plant populations, on the other hand, are constantly exposed to such biotic stressors and their higher genetic diversity often allows these populations to become locally adapted. Since many pest species are sensitive to climatic conditions, their pressure on plant communities is spatially heterogeneous, maintaining geographically structured genetic variation in plant defenses ( Züst et al., 2012; Kerwin et al., 2015 ). For these reasons, natural plant populations are highly suitable to study defense mechanisms and evolution of defenses, and also a very useful source of beneficial and resistance alleles for specific pathogens and environmental conditions. This genetic variation in defense-related genes can for example be screened through genome-wide association ( GWA ) ( Chan et al., 2010; Corwin et al., 2016; Thoen et al., 2017; Hanson et al., 2018 ) or approaches based on known candidate genes ( Kerwin et al., 2015 ). Many pest species are also highly sensitive to temporal variation in weather conditions. This temporal heterogeneity in pathogen pressure can induce plastic responses in plants, involving gene expression and epigenetic changes ( Jaouannet et al., 2015; Geng et al., 2019; Annacondia et al., 2021 ), which may also be studied through stress experiments ( Jaouannet et al., 2015; Geng et al., 2019; Annacondia et al., 2021 ). Some plastic epigenetic responses can have a transient stability and be transmitted to the next generations through inheritance of epigenetic marks ( Kinoshita and Seki, 2014; Espinas et al., 2016; Lämke and Bäurle, 2017; He and Li, 2018 ). In particular, DNA methylation has been shown to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses through gene expression regulation and transposable elements ( TEs ) reactivation, and can be inherited across generations ( Annacondia et al., 2021; Lämke and Bäurle, 2017; Roquis et al., 2021 ). In plants, DNA methylation can occur in the three sequence contexts CG, CHG, and CHH ( H being A, T, or C ), which differ in their molecular machineries depositing, maintaining, and removing methylation and consequently also in their transgenerational stability ( Law and Jacobsen, 2010; Zhang et al., 2018 ). While CG methylation is usually more stable across generations, CHH methylation is less stable and more responsive to stress and the sensitivity of CHG methylation lies somewhere in between ( Law and Jacobsen, 2010; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu and He, 2020 ). Whether inherited or induced, some strategies of plants for defense against pathogens and herbivores include: ( i ) physical barriers such as reinforced cell walls, leaf protective layers, or closing stomata, ( ii ) production of specialized ( secondary ) metabolites that reduce palatability or are toxic to pests, ( iii ) oxidative bursts, ( iv ) the activation of signaling cascades to induce systemic responses, and ( v ) RNA interference mechanisms to silence pathogen genes ( Wojtaszek, 1997; War et al., 2012; Kant et al., 2015; Melotto et al., 2017; Muhammad et al., 2019 ). In Brassicaceae, a particularly important and diverse class of defense metabolites are glucosinolates, which often show local adaptation driven by variation in pests and can also be induced by herbivore and pathogen attacks ( Züst et al., 2012; Kerwin et al., 2015; Kutyniok and Müller, 2012 ). Studying natural variation in plant resistance, along with associated genetic and epigenetic variation, can identify genes involved in defense and their regulators, including vital genes whose function cannot be determined through knockout experiments. Such knowledge, and especially the discovery of natural resistance alleles, are crucial sources for the breeding of more pest-resistant crop varieties. Nevertheless, because of the diversity of resistance mechanisms and their often multigenic nature, plant defense mechanisms remain difficult to study. In particular, antixenosis ( the prevention of pathogen settlement ) and antibiosis ( the repression of pathogen growth and reproduction ) require extensive and time-consuming phenotyping, based for example on choice ( Nalam et al., 2018 ) or settling ( Annacondia et al., 2021 ) assays, and such assays are extremely challenging to perform on large collections. On the other hand, there are increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets, which may also be used to quantify contaminants or microbiome composition ( Sangiovanni et al., 2019; Roman-Reyna et al., 2020; Gathercole et al., 2021 ) and thus as proxies for resistance phenotyping. In this study we investigated such usage of exogenous reads, i. e., reads not mapping to the target reference genome, as a source of information for quantifying herbivore and pathogen abundance in large collections. We worked with field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ), an annual plant in the Brassicaceae family that is increasingly studied as a model species ( Geng et al., 2021; Nunn et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Troyee et al., 2022; Galanti et al., 2022 ) and new biofuel and winter cover crop ( Dorn et al., 2015; Frels et al., 2019; Chopra et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021 ). In a previous study, we investigated natural epigenetic variation in a collection of 207 Thlaspi lines from across Europe ( Galanti et al., 2022 ). Prior to their whole-genome ( WGS ) and -epigenome sequencing these lines had been grown in a common environment, an open glasshouse where the plants were spontaneously colonized by aphids and powdery mildew, as well as by other microbes. At the time of sequencing, pathogen contamination was still very limited but appeared highly variable, and preliminary analyses showed that it resulted in sizeable amounts of non-target reads assigned to the pest species, i. e., contamination of the DNA samples. Inspired by other recent studies on non-target reads ( Sangiovanni et al., 2019; Roman-Reyna et al., 2020; Gathercole et al., 2021 ), we asked if there was systematic variation in the numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among different T. arvense lines, and whether these data, together with our whole-genome plant sequencing data, could provide insights into the genomic basis of plant resistance variation. The goals of our study were thus twofold: ( i ) to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in T. arvense, and ( ii ) to explore whether non-target reads from plant sequencing can be used as proxies for studying plant biotic interactions. Considering that we are moving toward an increasingly sequencing-prone world, with more and larger datasets being generated for many species ( Kajiya-Kanegae et al., 2021; Colgan et al., 2022; Habyarimana et al., 2022; Mekbib et al., 2022; Metheringham et al., 2022; Nocchi et al. 2022 ), this approach should have broad application in both fundamental and applied research. 

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

**Title:** Exploring the Genomic Basis of Plant Resistance to Pests Using Non-Target Reads from Whole-Genome Sequencing

**Background:** Plant resistance to pests is crucial for agriculture, but studying it requires labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. This study investigates whether non-target reads from whole-genome sequencing can serve as a proxy for phenotyping.

**Methods:** 207 lines of Thlas arse were grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. Whole-gen and epigen sequencing was performed.

**Findings:** Non-target reads differed between populations, had significant heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold-fluctuating habitats showed higher aphid load, indicating decreased resistance. Genome-wide analyses identified variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were associated with pathogen loads, including transposons and hypomethylation of a gene involved in stomatal closure.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that non-target whole-gen sequencing can be used to estimate plant biotic interactions. With increasing sequencing datasets, this approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research.

    Title: 
    Article: Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat this disease. Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug, have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations. In this study, we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ). We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors. We focus on one compound, TCMDC-125334, which was active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. In six selections with TCMDC-125334, the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although we did identify one mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus. These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Finally, we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme. 
 Antimicrobial resistance threatens our ability to combat multiple infectious agents, and is widely recognized as one of the greatest public health threats of the 21st century ( Jee et al., 2018 ). Globally, drug resistance is a recurring obstacle in efforts to control many endemic infectious diseases, and malaria is no exception. The emergence of resistance in Plasmodium parasite populations and subsequent treatment failure has been documented for all antimalarial drugs in clinical use, including frontline artemisinin combination therapies ( Haldar et al., 2018 ). Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop a next generation of drugs targeting distinct vulnerabilities of Plasmodium parasites. Additionally, understanding the pathways and susceptibility to drug resistance is important to assess next-generation antimalarials, ideally while they are still early in the development process. Inhibitors targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) offer an illustrative example. DHODH is an electron transport chain protein that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate in orotic acid, which is the rate-limiting step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. In Plasmodium, this reaction is dependent on flavin mononucleotide and ubiquinone cofactors and is coupled to mitochondrial respiration. Because Plasmodium lacks pyrimidine scavenging pathways, this enzyme is essential for parasite growth and survival ( Phillips and Rathod, 2010 ). Multiple high-throughput screens have identified DHODH as a drug target in Plasmodium falciparum ( Baldwin et al., 2005; Pavadai et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2018; Phillips et al., 2008 ), and the triazolopyrimidine-based DHODH inhibitor DSM265 was developed as a clinical antimalarial candidate ( Phillips et al., 2015 ). While the clinical DHODH inhibitor candidate DSM265 showed promising activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies ( Llanos-Cuentas et al., 2018; McCarthy et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2018; Phillips et al., 2015; Sulyok et al., 2017 ), we previously demonstrated that resistance to DSM265 emerges rapidly both in vitro and in a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum infection ( Mandt et al., 2019 ). Resistance was primarily conferred by point mutations in the dhodh locus. In Phase 2 clinical trials with DSM265, 2 out of 24 patients failed treatment due to resistance, with recrudescent parasites harboring mutations in dhodh including DHODH C276Y, C276F, and G181S ( Llanos-Cuentas et al., 2018 ). The C276Y and C276F mutations were also observed in in vitro resistance selections, as was DHODH G181C ( Phillips et al., 2015; Mandt et al., 2019; White et al., 2019 ). The point mutations C276F and G181D were observed in our in vivo selection model ( Mandt et al., 2019 ). A common strategy to counter the evolution of resistance is to utilize a combination of two or more drugs with distinct antimicrobial mechanisms. The basic rationale for this strategy is that even if there is some probability of an organism acquiring resistance to each drug separately, the probability that two resistance mutations would occur simultaneously is much lower. Combination therapy is the standard of treatment for malaria ( Hastings, 2011 ), tuberculosis ( Kerantzas and Jacobs, 2017 ), and HIV/AIDS ( Cihlar and Fordyce, 2016 ), and is increasingly being recommended for the treatment of other bacterial infections ( Schmid et al., 2019; Coates et al., 2020; Bodie et al., 2019 ). However, multidrug resistance has emerged in many major human pathogens, complicating patient treatment and threatening public health efforts to control the spread of disease ( Hamilton et al., 2019; Manson et al., 2017; Dheda et al., 2017; Gregson et al., 2017 ). Large-scale bacterial evolution studies have also shown that certain combinations of inhibitors can actually accelerate the emergence of resistance compared to treatment with a single inhibitor ( Hegreness et al., 2008; Dean et al., 2020 ). Thus, there is a need to re-evaluate the current treatment approach, and to strategically design combination therapies based on their ability to slow or suppress the emergence of resistance. One possible strategy takes advantage of collateral sensitivity, in which resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to another ( Baym et al., 2016 ). The phenomenon of collateral sensitivity, or ‘negative cross-resistance’, has been observed across various antibiotic classes in bacteria, as well as anti-fungals, and even cancer therapies ( Imamovic and Sommer, 2013; Rosenkilde et al., 2019; Maltas and Wood, 2019; Rank et al., 1975; Leroux et al., 2000; Dhawan et al., 2017; Lorendeau et al., 2017 ). Laboratory studies evaluating the evolution of resistance to antibiotics have demonstrated that when resistance to one inhibitor leads to collateral sensitivity to another, the two inhibitors can be used in a sequential cycling strategy to maintain sensitive bacterial populations ( Imamovic and Sommer, 2013; Kim et al., 2014 ), or simultaneously in combination to slow or suppress the evolution of resistance ( Gonzales et al., 2015; Munck et al., 2014; Rodriguez de Evgrafov et al., 2015 ). Collateral sensitivity to various classes of inhibitors targeting Plasmodium parasites has also been observed. For example, isoforms of the chloroquine resistance transporter ( PfCRT ) that transport chloroquine out of the parasite’s digestive vacuole can cause increased sensitivity to a variety of compounds ( Lukens et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2004; Sisowath et al., 2009; Richards et al., 2016; Cooper et al., 2002; Evans and Havlik, 1993; Small-Saunders et al., 2022 ). Collateral sensitivity has also been observed between compounds targeting different subunits of the Plasmodium proteasome Pf20S ( Kirkman et al., 2018; Stokes et al., 2019 ), between different chemotypes targeting the P-Type Cation-Transporter ATPase 4 ( PfATP4 ) ( Flannery et al., 2015 ), and between compounds targeting the Qo and Qi sites of cytochrome b ( Lukens et al., 2015 ). We have also previously shown that collateral sensitivity occurs during the evolution of resistance to Plasmodium DHODH inhibitors. Mutations in dhodh conferring resistance to one inhibitor can alter the enzyme such that it becomes more sensitive to inhibition by other, structurally distinct compounds ( Lukens et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2014 ). The existence of collateral sensitivity among a wide range of antimalarial inhibitors suggests a promising opportunity to exploit this phenomenon to block the emergence of resistant parasites ( Lukens et al., 2014 ). In an effort to expand this work, we explored the collateral sensitivity of Plmod diorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH ) to a diverse panel of DHH inhibitors, including TDC-125, a compound that was previously shown to be active against a range of DHH mutants ( Luk et al., 2014 ). In this study, we profiled the cross-resistance and collateral phenotypes of several DHH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHH inhibitors. We found that TDC-125 was active against all lines tested, including the DHH C276 line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. In selections with TDC-125, the most common mechanism of resistance was copy number variation of theod locus, although we identified one mutation, DHH263, which conferred resistance to TDC-125 but not DSM. We found that selection of the DHH276 mutant with TDC-125 yielded additional genetic changes inod locus. These double mutants exhibited decreased sensitivity to TDC-125 and were highly resistant to DSM. Finally, we tested whether collateral could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of treatment by exposing wildtype to both DSM and TDC-125 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with DHV mutation which were cross-resistant to both and as fit the wildtype in vitro. The emergence of cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of DH enzyme.

    Title: 
    Article: The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary drastically across different biogeographic regions. Though most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions. Existing models on resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance, possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, we developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data supports this trend. Post discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. 
 Prolonged usage of antimicrobial drugs almost always results in the emergence and spread of resistant strains ( zur Wiesch et al., 2011 ). The history of falciparum malaria chemotherapy over the last hundred years witnessed a succession of the spread of resistance to five classes of drugs region by region ( Blasco et al., 2017 ). However, the patterns of drug resistance evolution, such as the speed of establishment and equilibrium frequencies, differ drastically across different biogeographic regions. Even though de novo-resistant alleles are constantly generated, widespread resistant strains can almost always be traced back to two unstable transmission regions, that is, Southeast Asia ( especially the Greater Mekong Subregion ) and South America ( Ecker et al., 2012; Dondorp et al., 2009; Noedl et al., 2008 ). While the frequencies of resistant genotypes often sweep close to fixation in these regions under persistent drug usage ( Chaijaroenkul et al., 2011; Plummer et al., 2004 ), their frequencies are more variable in endemic transmission regions such as sub-Saharan Africa ( Talisuna et al., 2002 ). More interestingly, while in high-transmission regions a steady decrease of resistant genotypes often ensues from reducing the particular drug usage ( Narh et al., 2020; Hemming-Schroeder et al., 2018 ), resistant genotypes are maintained at high frequency in low or unstable transmission regions even after the abandonment of the drug for several decades ( Lanteri et al., 2014 ). Plenty of mathematical models have been developed to explain some, but not all, of the empirical drug resistance patterns. Various relationships between transmission intensity and stable frequencies of resistance were discovered, each of which has some empirical support: ( 1 ) transmission intensity does not influence the fate of resistant genotypes ( models: Koella and Antia, 2003; Masserey et al., 2022; empirical: Diallo et al., 2007; Shah et al., 2011; Shah et al., 2015 ) ; ( 2 ) resistance first increases in frequency and slowly decreases with increasing transmission rates ( models: Klein et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2012 ) ; and ( 3 ) valley phenomenon: resistance can be fixed at both high and low end of transmission intensity ( model: Artzy-Randrup et al., 2010; empirical: Talisuna et al., 2002 ). Other stochastic models predict that it is harder for resistance to spread in high-transmission regions, but patterns are not systematically inspected across the parameter ranges ( model: Whitlock et al., 2021; model and examples in Ariey and Robert, 2003 ). Under non-equilibrium scenarios, that is, where insecticides or bednets temporarily reduced transmission, reductions in resistance frequency were also observed ( Alifrangis et al., 2003; Mharakurwa et al., 2004; Myers-Hansen et al., 2020 ). Differences in these model predictions can be attributed to three types of model assumptions: ( 1 ) whether and how population immunity is considered, ( 2 ) how the cost of resistance is modeled, and ( 3 ) whether and how multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) is included. Although the great advances in malaria agent-based models ( ABMs ) enabled the inclusion of more detailed biological processes ( Maire et al., 2006; Masserey et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Labbé et al., 2023 ), the complexity of ABMs limits a direct application to analytical investigation. It is, therefore, critical to formulate a generalizable mathematical model that captures the most important biological processes that directly impact the survival and transmission of the parasites. While most models have explored factors such as drug usage ( Koella and Antia, 2003; Klein et al., 2012 ), treatment rate ( Masserey et al., 2022 ), vectorial capacity ( Artzy-Randrup et al., 2010; Bushman et al., 2018 ), within-host competition ( Bushman et al., 2018; Hastings, 2006 ), population immunity ( Klein et al., 2008; Artzy-Randrup et al., 2010 ), and recombination ( Curtis and Otoo, 1986; Dye and Williams, 1997; Hastings, 1997; Hastings and D’Alessandro, 2000 ), strain diversity of parasites has not been explicitly considered in mathematical models of drug resistance. Yet, orders of magnitude differentiate antigenic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum strains among biogeographic zones and drive key differences in epidemiological features ( Chen et al., 2011; Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018 ). Hyper-diverse antigens of parasites in sub-Saharan Africa emerged from the long-term co-evolutionary arms race among hosts, vectors, and parasites ( Volkman et al., 2001 ). In endemic regions of falciparum malaria, hosts do not develop sterile immunity and can constantly get reinfected with reduced symptoms ( Day and Marsh, 1991 ). These asymptomatic carriers of the parasite still constitute part of the transmission and serve as a reservoir of strain diversity ( Tiedje et al., 2017; Bonnet et al., 2003 ) despite the fact that parasite prevalence decreases with host age in endemic regions ( Aron, 1983 ). This age–prevalence pattern was attributed to acquired immunity after repeated infections and represented as different generalized immunity classes in disease dynamics models ( Dietz et al., 1974; Molineaux and Gramiccia, 1980; Klein et al., 2008 ). Later advances in molecular epidemiology indicate the importance of strain-specific immunity ( Kaufmann et al., 1999 ). During the asexual blood stage, intra-erythrocytic parasites express adhesin proteins at the red blood cell surface that help mediate binding to the epithelial layers of vasculature to avoid the clearance by spleen during circulation ( Bull et al., 1998 ). One of the major surface proteins, P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( PfEMP1 ), is encoded by var genes, a gene family of 60 different copies within a single parasite genome ( Rask et al., 2010 ). Immune selection maintains the composition of var genes between different strains with minimal overlap ( He et al., 2018 ). In high endemic regions, many antigenically distinct strains ( or modules of strains ) coexist in the transmission dynamics ( Pilosof et al., 2019 ). Whether the hosts have seen the specific variants of the var genes largely determines the clearance rate of the parasites ( Barry et al., 2011; Djimdé et al., 2003 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that variation in host-specific immunity, acquired from exposure to local antigenic diversity, plays a key role in local transmission dynamics as well as the fate of resistance. Thus, under the same vectorial capacity, different strain diversity results in significant changes in population-level immunity and transmission intensity, and the ensuing epidemiological patterns, such as MOI, age–prevalence curve, and the ratio of asymptomatic infections ( Tiedje et al., 2017; Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022 ). These changes, in turn, alter the fate of resistance invasion. Therefore, in addition to generalized immunity represented in earlier studies, models need to formally incorporate specific immunity. Another challenging aspect for earlier models is whether and how multiclonal infections ( those with MOI > 1 ) are considered. Due to malaria’s long duration of infection ( Collins and Jeffery, 1999 ), it is common for the host to carry infections that are contracted from separate bites, referred to as superinfections. Meanwhile, hosts can also receive multiple genetically distinct strains from a single bite, especially in high-transmission endemic regions ( Nkhoma et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2017; Henden et al., 2018 ). Susceptible-infected-recovered ( SIR ) models that only account for a single infection do not capture the dynamics of superinfections and MO > 1. To address this, we developed a novel compartmental model that tracks both resistant and susceptible strains, as well as the dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions while steadily decreases in high-divers, high-trans regions. Our study underscores the critical role of strain diversity in bioge patterns of resistance.

    Title: 
    Article: Cannabis, the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world, is increasingly used by pregnant women. However, while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo, the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking. Here, we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ). We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart. Surprisingly, this increased proliferation, dependent on the CB1 receptor binding, is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs’ metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development. 
 Cannabis is the most widely used illicit psychoactive drug in the world ( U. N Office on Drugs and Crime, 2022 ). In the United States, an estimated 49. 6 million people, roughly 18% of the population, consumed cannabis at least once in 2020, with indications that these numbers will likely increase in the coming years as attitudes and regulations change ( Mennis et al., 2023; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2020 ). In particular, between 7% and 12% of expecting women report cannabis use, predominantly during the first trimester, to alleviate the symptoms of morning sickness ( Chabarria et al., 2016; Volkow et al., 2019; Young-Wolff et al., 2018 ). These statistics indicate that a significant number of developing embryos are exposed to cannabis, with limited knowledge of the biological repercussions of such exposure. Among the several hundred unique phytocannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa, ( − ) -trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) is chiefly responsible for the psychoactivity of cannabis ( Andre et al., 2016 ). As a result, the level of Δ9-THC in recreational cannabis has increased over the last 10 years and now commonly accounts for 20% of total compounds ( Chandra et al., 2019 ). The psychoactive effects of Δ9-THC arise from its binding and subsequent activation of the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor CB1 largely expressed in the central nervous system ( Pacher et al., 2020 ). In this context, Δ9-THC exposure has been shown to durably alter metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic programs in the brain ( Bénard et al., 2012; Prini et al., 2018; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2018; Watson et al., 2015 ). While over the last decades, significant attention has been paid to Δ9-THC’s neurological effects, there is also evidence, albeit more limited, of its impact on reproductive functions ( Lo et al., 2022 ). Data shows CB1 expression in the male and the female reproductive tracts, in the pre-implantation embryo and in the placenta ( Lo et al., 2022; Paria et al., 1995 ). In animal models as well as in humans, exposure to cannabis is associated with reduced fertility, decreased testis weight and sperm count, and impairment of embryo implantation ( Lo et al., 2022 ). In males, these effects are correlated with an alteration of the sperm transcriptome and epigenome ( Murphy et al., 2018; Osborne et al., 2020; Schrott and Murphy, 2020 ). Epidemiological evidence also indicates that Δ9-THC exposure is associated with long-lasting adverse effects, with exposures in parents affecting the offspring ( Smith et al., 2020; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2018 ). Despite this accumulating evidence, the molecular impact and mechanisms of Δ9-THC exposure at the earliest stages of germ cells development remain to be determined. Progression through states of pluripotency is controlled by metabolic reprogramming in the early mammalian embryo ( Verdikt and Allard, 2021; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Accordingly, cultured pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) exhibiting different developmental potentials are marked by specific metabolic signatures, similar to the ones displayed by their in vivo counterparts in the embryo. For instance, mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) are naïve PSCs that are functionally equivalent to the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of the E3. 5 preimplantation mouse blastocyst ( Nichols and Smith, 2009 ). The extended developmental potential of mouse ESCs is associated with their metabolic bivalence, as these cells rely on both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. Differentiation of naïve ESCs into primed PSCs such as epiblast-like cells ( EpiLCs ) is accompanied by an important metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis, in link with a highly proliferative phenotype and a more restricted developmental potential ( Hayashi et al., 2017; Verdikt and Allard, 2021; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Primordial germ cells ( PGCs ), the embryonic precursors of gametes in metazoans ( Hayashi et al., 2007; Kurimoto and Saitou, 2018 ), are considered dormant totipotent cells because they possess the unique ability to reacquire totipotency upon fertilization ( Hayashi et al., 2017 ). In the mouse embryo, the precursors to PGCs arise around embryonic day 6. 25 ( E6. 25 ) from formative pluripotent cells in the epiblast ( Kinoshita et al., 2021; Kurimoto and Saitou, 2018 ). Progressive increase in oxidative phosphorylation correlates with the specification and differentiation from epiblast PSCs towards PGCs, a process that can be replicated in vitro by inducing PGC-like cells ( PGCLCs ) from EpiLCs ( Hayashi et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2022 ). In particular, the extensive metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic reprogramming that PGCs undergo during their development has been proposed to be uniquely sensitive to environmental insults, with potential consequences in the offspring ( Verdikt et al., 2022 ). Here, we deployed this in vitro differentiation system to investigate the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early developmental stages. We demonstrate that exposure of ESCs and EpiLCs to Δ9-THC durably alters their metabolome. We reveal that, in the absence of continuous exposure, metabolic memory of Δ9-THC is passed onto the PGCLCs stage leading to transcriptional defects in these cells. Together, our findings highlight the role of metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism for early developmental Δ9-THC exposure. 
 To model the impact of early Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic events, we first tested three distinct developmental windows: ( 1 ) exposure of ESCs, ( 2 ) exposure of EpiLCs, and ( 3 ) combined ESCs +EpiLCs exposure ( Figure 1A ). Cells were either exposed to the vehicle ( mock ) or exposed to Δ9-THC in a wide dose range of 0. 1 nM-100µM, corresponding to the reported physiologically-relevant concentrations of Δ9-THC in cannabis users ( Fuchs Weizman et al., 2021; Hunault et al., 2009; Pacifici et al., 2020 ). The viability of ESCs exposed to increasing concentrations of Δ9-THC for 48 hr was not significantly altered until the maximal dose of 100 µM, subsequently serving as a positive control, at which only 13. 17% of cells remained alive ( Figure 1B, p=5. 10–15, unpaired T-test ). While no significant changes in viability were observed between 10 nM and 1 µM Δ9-THC, the number of viable ESCs significantly increased by 1. 69, 1. 52 and 1. 28-fold, respectively, compared to the mock-treated condition ( Figure 1C, p=0. 002, p=0. 01 and p=0. 03 for 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 µM of Δ9-THC, unpaired T-test ). Of note, the number of viable ESCs significantly increased for doses of Δ9-THC as low as 1 nM ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and, 0. 59-fold increase, p=0. 0005, unpaired T-test ), corresponding to doses found in users of ‘light cannabis ( Fuchsiz et al. 202 ). In contrast, the number of ELCs exposed to Δ-THC did not significantly change ( Figure 1D, p= 0. 5 unpaired T-test ). The combined exposure of ESCs and ELCs to Δ-TH resulted in an increase in the number of both cell types ( Figure 1E, p= 0.01 and= 0.01 unpaired T-test for ESCs and ELCs, respectively ). These results indicate that Δ-TH increases the proliferation of naive ESCs but not primed ELCs. Next, we investigated the role of the CB receptor in Δ-TH-induced proliferation of ESCs. The CB receptor is the primary target of Δ-TH in the central nervous system ( Pacher et al. 202 ) and has been implicated in the regulation of metabolism ( Bén et al 2012; Prini et al 2018; Watson et al 2015 ). We treated ESCs with the CB antagonist AM251 to block the receptor and found that Δ-TH-induced proliferation was abolished ( Figure 2A, p= 0.01 unpaired T-test ). This suggests that Δ-TH-induced proliferation of ESCs is dependent on the CB receptor. We next examined the transcriptome of ESCs exposed to Δ-TH and found that only moderate changes were associated with the proliferation ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, Δ-TH significantly increased glycolytic and anabolic capabilities of ESCs ( Figure 2, p= 0.01 and= 0.01 unpaired-test for glycolytic and anabolic rates respectively ). These results indicate that Δ-TH capitalizes on ESC metabolic bivalence by increasing glycol and anabolic rates. To determine if this metabolic rewiring is retained during differentiation, we differentiated ESCs into PGCLs in the absence of Δ-TH and found that glycol and anabolic rates remained increased ( Figure 3,= 0.01= 0. unpaired-test for glycol and anabolic rates ). Moreover, the transcription profile of PGCLs was altered ( Figure 3,= 0.01= 0 unpaired-test ). These results suggest that Δ-TH exposure induces metabolic rewiring in ESCs that is retained during differentiation and associated with transcriptional changes in PGs. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the impact of Δ-TH on early stages of germl development and highlights the role of metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism of Δ-TH exposure. Our findings provide first in-depth characterization of Δ-TH exposure on early stages germl development and suggest that Δ-TH increases proliferation of naive ESCs but not primed ELCs, dependent on the CB receptor. Moreover, Δ-TH capitalizes ESC metabolic bivalence by increasing glycol and anabolic rates and this rewiring is retained during differentiation and associated with transcriptional changes in PGs.

    Title: 
    Article: Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes, but similar studies are rare in animals. The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, we identified a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low: around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection. 
 The innate immune system of an organism provides the first defense line against pathogens. Immune genes tend to evolve quickly and are often associated with a high degree of genetic variability. Many genes and proteins of the immune system are lineage-specific ( limited to specific groups of animals, plants, or other taxa ), while others have defense roles in a wide range of species. In particular, proteins containing a large nucleotide-binding domain followed by smaller repeats have an immune function in animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria alike ( Ting et al., 2008; Jones and Dangl, 2006; Uehling et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2022 ). In animals, these repeats are usually leucine-rich repeats ( LRRs ) and the proteins themselves are classified as NLRs ( nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing, also known as NOD-like receptors ). They have a multitude of functions: some act as pathogen sensors or transcription factors ( Almeida-da-Silva et al., 2023 ), others are components or modulators of inflammasomes, large protein complexes that are assembled within cells as part of the response to biological or chemical danger ( Almeida-da-Silva et al., 2023 ). Plants have their own NLRs that are structurally similar to the ones from animals and also carry out central functions in the immune response ( Urbach and Ausubel, 2017; Yue et al., 2012 ). Their diversity has been extensively characterized in several species, including the thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), and vastly different repertoires have been found from different strains or individuals ( Van de Weyer et al., 2019b ). NLR repertoires can also be referred to as NLRomes, and a species-wide repertoire is called the ‘pan-NLRome’. Most knowledge about NLRs in animals comes from studies of humans and rodents, but their NLR repertoires ( 20–30 genes ) are smaller than those of many other species such as the purple sea urchin, the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, and many fish ( Hibino et al., 2006; Yuen et al., 2014; Suurväli et al., 2022 ). However, even in mice one NLR ( Nlrp1 ) has different copy numbers in different laboratory strains, ranging from 2 to 5 ( Lilue et al., 2018 ). In many fishes, studies have reported NLR repertoires in the range of 10–50 genes ( e. g., Rajendran et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016 ). In others, hundreds of NLRs are present, including in the model species zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) ( Stein et al., 2007; Laing et al., 2008; Tørresen et al., 2018; Adrian-Kalchhauser et al., 2020; Suurväli et al., 2022 ). The zebrafish reference genome contains nearly 400 NLR genes, two-thirds of which are located on the putative sex chromosome ( chromosome 4 ), in a genomic region associated with extensive haplotypic variation ( Howe et al., 2013; Howe et al., 2016; McConnell et al., 2023; Anderson et al., 2012 ). The majority of fish NLRs represent a fish-specific subtype that was originally labeled NLR-C ( Laing et al., 2008 ), although they can be further divided into at least six groups based on structural similarities and sequence of conserved exons ( Howe et al., 2016; Adrian-Kalchhauser et al., 2020 ). A schematic structure of proteins encoded by zebrafish NLR-C genes is presented in Figure 1A. All of them possess a FISNA domain ( fish-specific NACHT-associated domain ), which precedes the nucleotide-binding domain NACHT and is encoded by the same large exon near the N-terminus of the protein ( Howe et al., 2016 ). FISNA-NACHT is in some cases preceded by the effector domain PYD, but this is encoded by a separate exon ( Howe et al., 2016 ). Additionally, many NLR-C proteins have a B30. 2 domain ( also known as PRY/SPRY ) at the C-terminal end, separated from FISNA-NACHT by multiple introns and exons containing the LRRs ( Figure 1A; Howe et al., 2016 ). The B30. 2 domain functions through protein–protein interaction ( Woo et al., 2006 ) and is also found in a variety of other genes such as the large family of TRIM ubiquitin ligases ( van der Aa et al., 2009; Howe et al., 2016; Suurväli et al., 2022 ) that are often also involved in immunity. It is not known why fishes possess so many NLRs, how they evolve, and how much within-species genetic variability they have. The previously observed repeated expansions and contractions of this family suggest it to have a high rate of gene birth and death ( Suurväli et al., 2022 ). Studies have shown that viral and bacterial infections can induce the expression of specific fish NLRs ( reviewed in Chuphal et al., 2022 ). Some of these have PYD or CARD domains and can even form inflammasomes similar to mammalian NLRs ( Kuri et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018b ). A species-wide inventory of major NLR exons in a model species such as zebrafish would provide valuable insights into the evolution and diversity of this large immune gene family. 
 We used an orthology clustering approach on NLR sequences assembled from all populations to create a reference set of NLRs ( a pan-NLRome ). This resulted in the identification of 1513 unique FISNA-NACHT containing sequences and 567 for NLR-associated B30. 2 ( NLR-B30. 2 ). Nearly 10% of the sequences ( 145 FISNA-NACHT and 64 NLR-B30. 2 ) contained pre-mature stop codons that were at least 10 amino acids from the end and led to early truncation of the protein. In total, 101 of the 1513 FISNA-NACHT were preceded by an exon containing the N-terminal effector domain PYD. Nearly all of those ( 97 out of 101 ) were found in group 1 NLR-C genes identified by the presence of the characteristic sequence motif GIAGVGKT ( Howe et al., 2016 ). Since the combination of FISNA and NACHT is only present in NLR-C, its count of 1513 can be considered equal to the total number of NLR-C genes in the data. We found each individual zebrafish to have 100–550 NLR genes from the pan-NLRome in at least one copy ( Figures 2 and 3 ), and only 50–75% of these have a high-quality match in the GRCz11 reference genome ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). In general, laboratory zebrafish had less NLRs than wild samples ( Figure 2 ). The number and length of CCS reads and assembled contigs ( both prior to orthology clustering ) are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Whereas FISNA-NACHT is only found in NLRs, B30. 2 domains are also found in other gene families. In addition to the 567 NLR-B30. 2 domains, we also found 732 B30. 2 domains not associated with NLRs. We were able to distinguish between them by utilizing the sequence of a short highly conserved 47 bp exon that appears to precede B30. 2 in NLRs, but not in other genes ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). Each individual zebrafish possesses 20–180 NLR-B30. 2 domains ( Figures 2 and 3 ), and 50–75 of these have a high-quality match in the Gz reference genome ( Figure 2— supplement 2 ). In contrast to NLRs, N-B30. 2 domains are more abundant in laboratory zebish than in wild ( Figure 2 ). The number and length of CCS and contigs assembled prior to orthology are presented in Figure 2— supplement 1. In total, we identified 151 FNA-NAC and 567 N-B30. 2 domains in the zebish pan-NLRome. Of the 151 FNA-NAC domains, 145 contained pre-mature stop codons that led to truncation of the protein. Of the 567 N-B. 2 domains, 732 were not associated with NLR. We found each zebish to have 100–550 NLR from the pan-NLR at least one copy ( Figures 2 and 3 ), and 50–75 of these have a high-quality in the Gz reference ( Figure 2— supplement 2 ). In general, laboratory zish had less NLR than wild ( Figure 2 ). The number and length CCS and contigs assembled prior to orthology are presented in Figure 2— supplement. 
This study aimed to investigate the diversity of NLR genes in the zebraf ( Danio rerio ), a species with hundreds of NLR genes. We sequenced 93 zeb from multiple wild and laboratory populations and identified a total of 151 NLR, more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations but 4% were found 80 or more of the individual. Fish have up two as many NLR per individual up four as NLR per population than laboratory strains. In contrast, nucleotide diversity in zraf NLR genes is low around half the copies are monomorphic the remaining have few polymorphisms likely signature purifying.

    Title: 
    Article: The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition. 
 Since plants colonized the land, wind dispersal ( anemochory ) became common with the seed wing representing a key dispersal strategy through geological history ( Taylor et al., 2009; Ma, 2009; McLoughlin and Pott, 2019 ). Winged seeds evolved numerous times in many lineages of extinct and extant seed plants ( spermatophytes ) ( Schenk, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2015 ). Lacking wings as integumentary outgrowths, the earliest ovules in the Famennian ( 372–359 million years ago [Ma], Late Devonian ) rarely played a role in wind dispersal ( Rowe, 1997 ). Furthermore, nearly all Famennian ovules are cupulate, i. e., borne in a protecting and pollinating cupule ( Prestianni et al., 2013; Meyer-Berthaud et al., 2018 ). Warsteinia was a Famennian ovule with four integumentary wings, but its attachment and cupule remain unknown ( Rowe, 1997 ). Guazia was a Famennian ovule with four wings and it is terminally borne and acupulate ( devoid of cupule ) ( Wang et al., 2022 ). This paper documents a new Famennian seed plant with ovule, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. It occurs in Jianchuan mine of China, where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron ( Wang et al., 2019 ). The terminally borne ovules are three-winged and clearly acupulate, thus implying additional or novel functions of integument. Based on current fossil evidence and mathematical analysis, we discuss the evolution of winged seeds and compare the wind dispersal of seeds with different number of wings. 
 All fossils came from Upper Devonian Wutong Formation at Jianchuan mine in Xinhang town, Guangde City, Anhui Province, China. Details on locality are available in previous works ( Wang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022 ). At Jianchuan mine, Wutong Formation consists of Guanshan Member with quartzose sandstone and a little mudstone, and the overlying Leigutai Member with inter-beds of quartzose sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. Spore analysis indicates that the Leigutai Member here is late Famennian in age ( Gao et al., 2023 ). Progymnosperm Archaeopteris and lycopsid Leptophloeum occur in Leigutai and/or Guanshan members, and they were distributed worldwide in the Late Devonian ( Taylor et al., 2009 ). Fernlike plant Xinhangia ( Yang and Wang, 2022 ) and lycopsid Sublepidodendron ( Xu et al., 2022 ) were found at the basal part of Leigutai Member. In situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron with stigmarian rooting system appear in multiple horizons of Leigutai Member and they formed the Xinhang forest ( Wang et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2022 ). From many horizons of siltstone and mudstone of Wutong Formation ( Leigutai Member ) at Jianchuan mine, numerous ovules of Alasemenia were collected ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 ) and some were transversely sectioned to show the ovular structure ( Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ). The generic name from the Latin ‘ala’ and ‘semen’, meaning wing and seed, respectively; the specific epithet from the Latin ‘tri’ ( three ), referring to wing number of a seed. PKUB21721a, b ( part and counterpart housed in Department of Geology, Peking University, Beijing ) ( Figure 1a, m and n ). Xinhang, Guangde, Anhui, China; Leigutai Member of Wutong Formation, Upper Devonian. Dichotomous branches bearing terminal and acupulate ovules. Three broad wing-like integumentary lobes radially and symmetrically attached to each nucellus, distally tapered and proximally reduced. Integumentary lobes evidently extending outwards, with their free parts ca. 40% of ovule length. Individual integumentary lobes folding inwards along abaxial side. Nucellus largely adnate to integument. Some ovules are borne terminally on smooth branches that are thrice ( Figure 1a ), twice ( Figure 1c ) or once ( Figure 1b, f, g and i, Figure 2a–c ) dichotomous at 40–135°. The boundary between ovule and ultimate axis below refers to position where the ovule width just begins to increase ( e. g. Figure 1a, arrow ). The branches excluding ovules are up to 76 mm long and 0. 4–0. 9 mm wide. Most ovules terminate ultimate axis ( Figure 1j, Figure 2d–f ) or are detached ( Figure 1d, e, h and k, Figure 2g–o ). The ovules are 25. 0–33. 0 mm long and 3. 5–5. 6 mm at the maximum width ( excluding the width of outward extension of integumentary wings ). Compressions of ovules ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 ) and their serial transverse sections ( Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ) do not show any cupules. Each ovule possesses a layer of integument with three radially arranged and wing-like integumentary lobes ( Figure 1a, d and e, Figure 2d, e and o, arrows, Figure 3a–f, Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ). They are broad, acropetally tapered and proximally reduced to merge with the ultimate axis ( Figure 1a–c and f, Figure 2a, d–i and n ). The integumentary lobes are 1. 2–2. 3 mm at the maximum width and free for 8. 3–14. 8 mm distance ( 32–45% of the ovule length ), and the free lobe parts extend well above the nucellar tip and greatly curve outward. Usually, two lobes of a single ovule are evident and the third one is sometimes exposed through dégagement ( Figure 1a, Figure 2n, arrow 2, o, middle arrow, Figure 3a and e, arrow ). Such situation indicates that the lobes of an ovule are present on different bedding planes. In transverse sections of an ovule, two integumentary lobes extend along the bedding plane, and the third lobe is either originally perpendicular to or compressed to lie somewhat along the bedding plane ( Figure 4c–e, h–k, n–r, t and w–y, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ). The integumentary lobes are narrow, flattened and fused in the lower part of an ovule, and acropetally become wide ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure— supplement 1, Figure— supplement 2, Figure— supplement 3, Figure— supplement 4, Figure— supplement 5 ). The integary lobes are radially symmetrical to the nuc ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 Figure— supplement 1, Figure— supplement, Figure 2 Figure— supplement, Figure 3— supplement, Figure 4— supplement, Figure 4— supplement 5 ). In transverse sections of ovules ( Figure 4, Figure— supplement 1, Figure— supplement, Figure 2— supplement, Figure 3— supplement, Figure 4— supplement, Figure 4— supplement 5 ) show that the integary lobes are radially symmetrical to the nuc. The integary lobes are radially symmetrical to the nuc ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4— supplement 1,— supplement, Figure 2— supplement, Figure 3— supplement, Figure— 4 supplement, Figure 4— supplement 5 ). The integary lobes are radially symmetrical to nuc ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4— supplement 1,— supplement, Figure 2— supplement, Figure 3— supplement, Figure— 4, supplement Figure 4— supplement 5 ). The integary lobes are radially symmetrical to nuc ( Figure 1, 2, Figure 3, Figure 4— supplement 1,—, Figure 2— supplement, Figure 3— supplement, Figure— 4, Figure 4— supplement 5 ) The integary lobes are radially symmetrical nuc ( Figure 1, 2, 3, Figure 4— supplement 1, 2, Figure— supplement 3, Figure— 4, 4— supplement 5 ) The integary lobes radially symmetrical nuc ( Figure 1, 2, 3, Figure 4— 1, 2,— supplement 3, Figure— 4 4,— supplement 5 ) The integ lobes radially symmetrical nuc ( 1 2 3 Figure 4— 1 2— supplement 3 Figure 4— 4 supplement 5 ) The lobes radially symmetrical nuc ( 1 2 3 4— 1 2 supplement 3 4— 4 5 ) lob radially symmetrical n ( 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 ) radially symmetrical ( 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 ) radially sym (1 2 3 4 1 2 3 ) radially (1 2 3 1 2 3 ) radially (1 2 1 2 3 ) radially (1 1 2 ) radially (1 ) radially ( ) radially ( ) radially ( ) radially ( radially ) radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially radially

    Title: 
    Article: Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph+ leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression, or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. 
 Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t ( 9;22 ) ( q34. 1; q11. 2 ) ( de Klein et al., 1982; Deininger et al., 2000 ). This cytogenetic abnormality results in a BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes the chimeric protein BCR-ABL with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity ( Cortes et al., 2021 ). Based on its oncogenic role in Ph+ leukemia, BCR-ABL has been regarded as the most pivotal target for Ph+ leukemia therapy, especially for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have been the main treatment option for Ph+ leukemia, remarkably prolonging the patients’ lifespan and improving their quality of life ( Hochhaus et al., 2020; Jabbour and Kantarjian, 2020 ). However, most patients develop TKI resistance and relapse after long-term treatment ( Braun et al., 2020 ). It is worth noting that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia in addition to the mutations in the kinase domain ( Jabbour et al., 2007 ). Mutations in the kinase domain can change the conformation of BCR-ABL, thus interfering with the binding between TKIs and BCR-ABL and resulting in decreased therapeutic efficacy ( Lussana et al., 2018 ). In parallel, the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of disease progression and TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia ( Barnes et al., 2005 ). Therefore, effective degradation of BCR-ABL could address the issues on TKI resistance and leukemia-initiating cells ( LICs ), and PROTAC-based protein degradation strategy may represent a new therapeutic approach ( Békés et al., 2022 ). Currently, based on different ubiquitin E3 ligases, including VHL, CRBN, and IAP, PROTAC-based degraders at nM level have shown significant degradation of BCR-ABL in CML cell lines, cell lines carrying mutations in BCR-ABL as well as patient-derived primary cells containing multiple BCR-ABL mutations ( Demizu et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2016; Shimokawa et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Burslem et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022 ). Unfortunately, the excellent cellular activity by the PROTAC-based degraders has not been able to translate to in vivo efficacy, even in rare examples of xenografted mouse models ( Zhao et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2021b ), resulting in uncertain usefulness of these degraders. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory results are not really surprising because the underlying mechanism of elevated BCR-ABL expression remains largely unclear. Receptor-associated protein of the synapse ( RAPSYN ) has been identified as a classic synaptic adaptor protein that binds to the acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) and several cytoskeleton-associated proteins, contributing to AChR clustering and neuromuscular junction formation ( Huh and Fuhrer, 2002; Witzemann et al., 2013 ). Later, RAPSYN was found to exert NEDD8 E3 ligase activity to catalyze the neddylation for AChR aggregation ( Li et al., 2016 ). Despite the extensive studies of RAPSYN in muscular and neuronal cells and tissues ( Legay and Mei, 2017; Li et al., 2018 ), with regard to its involvement in leukemogenesis, there is no available information thus far except for our previous finding. Previously, RAPSYN was found to be located in the cytosol of the typical Ph+ leukemia cell line K562 when a small molecule was used to probe its binding proteins using a proteomics approach ( Wang et al., 2015 ). Because of its newly identified E3 ligase activity for neddylation and its occurrence in the Ph+ leukemia cell line, we speculated that RAPSYN might contribute to Ph+ leukemia development through its enzymatic activity instead of only serving as a scaffolding protein. As a type of post-translational modification ( PTM ), neddylation is sequentially catalyzed by the neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 ( NEDD8 ) -activating enzyme E1 ( NAE1 ), NEDD8-conjugating enzyme E2 ( UBE2M/UBC12 or UBE2F ), and a substrate-specific NEDD8 E3 ligase to complete the covalent conjugation of NEDD8 to a lysine residue of its substrates ( van der Veen and Ploegh, 2012; Enchev et al., 2015 ). The neddylation of proteins can be reversed by deneddylases such as NEDP1. In the last two decades, accumulating evidence indicated the strong involvement of dysregulated neddylation in tumor progression, neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases, aberrant immunoregulation and others ( Ying et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020 ), which rationalizes the modulation of neddylation as a feasible therapeutic strategy. In this study, we report that RAPSYN is highly expressed along with BCR-ABL in patients with Ph+ leukemia and promotes disease progression, presumably by stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein via neddylation. The neddylation of BCR-ABL by RAPSYN subsequently competes its ubiquitination-dependent degradation to increase the stability of BCR-ABL. Additionally, the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN can be substantially increased by SRC-mediated phosphorylation, leading to enhanced stability and activity of RAPSYN. 
 Prior to investigating the biological roles of RAPSYN in the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia, its expression at both mRNA and protein levels was analyzed. We analyzed mRNA levels of RAPSN in RNA-seq datasets of GSE13204, GSE13159, GSE138883, and GSE140385, and no difference of RAPSN mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was found between CML patients and healthy donors ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). Neither a publicly available database nor our collection of patient samples and cell lines showed a significant increase in mRNA levels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C ). The protein levels of RAPSYN were substantially elevated in the PBMCs of Ph+ CML ( #8–11 ) and the bone marrow of ALL ( #7 ) patient samples in comparison to that of healthy donors ( #1–6 ), which was in a direct accordance with the expression of BCR-ABL ( Figure 1A ). This co-expression of RAPSYN and BCR-ABL was also found in Ph+ cell lines ( Figure 1B ), suggesting that the function of RAPSYN in Ph+ leukemia could be closely related to BCR-ABL. To examine the relationship between RAPSYN and Ph+ leukemia progression, we first performed knockdown of its expression by using shRNAs. Whereas notable cytotoxicity following marked reduction of RAPSYN was observed in all tested Ph+ leukemia cell lines and CML patient PBMCs ( Figure 1C, D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F ), transduction with the shRNA for RAPSN did not affect cell viability of RAPSYN- and BCR-ABL-negative HS-5 cells, indicating specificity of the effect ( Figure 1— supplement 1G ). Moreover, RSY knockdown RSY significantly decreased B-ABL protein levels in Ph+ cells ( Figure 1E ), suggesting that RSY is involved in the stabilization of B-ABL via nedlation. To confirm the role of RSY in B- stabilization, we analyzed the ubiquitination of B- by immunoprecipitation ( IP ) and western blotting ( WB ) after RSY knockdown ( Figure 1F ). The ubiquitination of B- was increased following RSY knockdown, indicating that RSY competes the degradation of B- via nedlation. To investigate the mechanism of RSY -mediated B- stabilization, we examined the NED E3 ligase activity of RSY after RSY knockdown ( Figure 1G ). The NED E3 ligase activity of RSY was significantly decreased following RSY knockdown, suggesting that RSY is responsible for the nedlation of B- Furthermore, we found that SRC phosphorylates RSY to activate its NED E ligase activity ( Figure 1H ), leading to increased stability and activity of RSY. To investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting RSY in Ph leukemia, we used PROTAC-based degrader to deplete RSY ( Figure 2A ). The PROT-based degr of RSY significantly decreased B- levels in Ph+ cells ( Figure 2B ) and inhibited cell growth ( Figure 2C ) and colony formation ( Figure 2D ) of Ph leukemia cells. In contrast, PROT-based degr of RSY did not affect the viability of RSY- and B- negative HS-5 cells ( Figure 2E ), indicating specificity of the effect. Moreover, PROT-based degr of R decreased the levels of B- in Ph cells ( Figure 2F ) and increased its ubiquitination ( Figure 2G ), suggesting that RSY is involved in the stabilization of B via nedlation. To confirm the therapeutic potential of targeting RSY in Ph leukemia, we used a xenografted mouse model ( Figure 3 ). The PROT-based degr of R significantly inhibited tumor growth ( Figure 3A ) and reduced B levels ( Figure 3B ) in the xenografts. In contrast, PROT-basedgr of R did not affect the viability of RSY and- B- HS-5 cells ( Figure 3 ) indicating specificity of the effect. These results demonstrate that RSY is a potential therapeutic target for Ph leukemia and suggest a rationale for targeting RSY-mediated B- nedlation in the treatment of Ph leukemia.

    Title: 
    Article: Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs. 
 Despite decades of concerted action from all over the world, antimicrobial resistance remains a growing global threat today ( Nathan, 2020 ). The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials leads to their accumulation in the environment, eventually increasing the chances of bacterial pathogens to acquire resistance ( Van Boeckel et al., 2019; Rawson et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the concept of ‘One Health’ has been proposed to address the alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance ( McEwen and Collignon, 2018; Hernando-Amado et al., 2019 ). In recent decades, the number of bacteria resistant to first-line drugs, as well as second- and third-line drugs, has been increasing. Some of these bacteria have even been identified as multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, or pan-drug-resistant isolates ( Talaat et al., 2022 ). For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii pose a serious threat and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human infectious diseases ( Brink, 2019 ). In addition, the global medical need for new antimicrobials has not yet been fully addressed. Considerable evidence shows that bacterial peptidoglycan is a promising target for the development of antimicrobial agents with a low risk of resistance development. A well-documented example in this regard are the peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, derived from phages. In recent years, lysins have been shown to be efficient alternatives to traditional antibiotics for infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria in various animal models ( De Maesschalck et al., 2020; Schmelcher and Loessner, 2021 ). Encouragingly, several lysins targeting S. aureus have been evaluated in clinical trials ( Theuretzbacher and Piddock, 2019 ). However, the development of lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria is relatively recent, mainly because the bacterial outer membrane prevents lysins from accessing their peptidoglycan substrates. In the last decade, several strategies have been developed to enable lysin to overcome the outer membrane barrier and directly target Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, Artilysins are constructed by fusion of cationic nonapeptides to effectively eradicate resistant and persistent A. baumannii ( Defraine et al., 2016 ) ; Innolysins are engineered by fusion of receptor-binding proteins to display bactericidal activity against E. coli that was resistant to third-generation cephalosporins ( Zampara et al., 2020 ) ; bioengineered lysin-bacteriocin fusion molecule, i. e., Lysocins, are able to deliver lysin across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and show selective anti-Pseudomonal activity ( Heselpoth et al., 2019 ). In addition, the establishment of high-throughput mining or engineering strategies has accelerated the discovery of active lysins against Gram-negative pathogens, e. g., the VersaTile-driven platform, which can rapidly screen engineered lysins active against A. baumannii from tens of thousands of combinations by integrating new DNA assembly methods and iterative screening procedures ( Gerstmans et al., 2020 ). However, compared with the current progress in the clinical translation of lysins against Gram-positive bacteria, the discovery of lysins against Gram-negative bacteria that meet the needs described in the WHO priority pathogen list is still urgently needed ( Briers and Lavigne, 2015; Lai et al., 2020 ). Additionally, the discovery of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases has also been hampered by limited sources of published phage genome data. Although not yet tested extensively, recent progress in lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria have demonstrated a clue linking antibacterial activity to their internal antimicrobial peptides ( Vázquez et al., 2021 ), by which lysins cross the bacterial outer membrane and contact its underlying peptidoglycan substrates ( Lood et al., 2015; Thandar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021 ). These observations prompted us to consider whether antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases or their homologs could be mined from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as template. As a proof-of-concept, we here used the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin ( Lood et al., 2015 ) as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases from the A. baumannii proteome database ( PHAbs, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Two of them ( PHAb10 and PHAb11 ) were found to be hyperthermally stable even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, which is mediated by a unique monomer-dimer swapping. Furthermore, both were active against a wide variety of clinically relevant bacteria in vitro and in mouse infection models. This observation supports our hypothesis that antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy is feasible for discovering new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes. 
 Since a variety of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria are shown to harbor an N- or C-terminal antimicrobial peptide, this led us to speculate that antimicrobial peptide could be used as template to mine new peptidoglycan hydrolases. To prove this hypothesis, P307, a well-documented antimicrobial peptide against A. baumannii from PlyF307 lysin ( Lood et al., 2015; Thandar et al., 2016 ), was used as the template to mine putative peptidoglycan hydrolases from A. baumannii ( PHAb ) proteome databases publicly available in NCBI ( Figure 1a ). Finally, 204 hits were identified and further divided into five clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Clade I contained 162 hits with high similarity ( >85% ) to the AcLys lysin from A. baumannii 5057UW prophage ( Figure 1b ), and clade II–V contained 42 hits with relatively lower homology ( 40–77% ) to each other ( Figure 1b; Figure 1—figure supplement 2a ). Due to the high similarity of amino acid sequences within each clade, we selected a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from each clade for further characterization by analyzing the selectivity priority in evolution and the overall physicochemical properties ( water solubility, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, charge, flexibility, and rigidity ) of each sequence in silico. Finally, WP_065188953. 1 from clade I, WP_038349544. 1 from clade II, KCY28522. 1 from clade III, WP_000109885. 1 from clade IV, and WP_032023242. 1 from clade V were shortlisted and renamed as PHAb11, PHAb10, PHAb9, PHAb8, and PHAb7, respectively, for further investigation ( Figure 1b ). Further homology analysis revealed that these five peptidoglycan hydrolases showed great diversity with the structured AcLys lysin and the original PlyF307 lysin ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2b ). To evaluate the bactericidal activity of these putative peidlycan hyrolases, they were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). PH10 and PH11 showed potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of clinically relevant bacteria in vitro ( Figure 2a ), while PH8 and PH7 were thermosensitive ( Figure 2a ). PH10 and PH11 retained activity after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr ( Figure 2b ), while PH8 and PH7 lost activity after 30 min ( Figure 2 ). To understand the structural basis of thermostability, we solved the crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 by X-ray crystallography ( Figure 3 ). PH8 formed a monomer, while PH10 and PH11 underwent a unique monomer-dimer transition ( Figure 3 ). The monomer-dimer transition of PH10 and PH11 was mediated by a dimeromer-dimer interaction ( Figure 3 ), which was not observed in PH8 ( Figure 3 ). The dimer-dimer interaction in PH10 and PH11 may be responsible for their thermostability ( Figure 3 ). To evaluate the safety and efficacy of PH10 in vivo, two mouse models of infection were used ( Figure 4 ). PH10 showed potent bactericidal activity against A. baumanni in both models ( Figure 4 ) and was safe ( Figure 4 ). In conclusion, our antimicrobial-primed strategy provides clues for the discovery of promising peidlycan hyrolases with bacteridal activity and desirable physico properties from bacterial proteomes.

    Title: 
    Article: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options. Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis. In this retrospective study, we used symptom and disease codes ( ICD-10 ) from the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) encompassing 6. 9 million patients from 1994 to 2018,, of whom 23, 592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish cancer registry included 18, 523 of these patients. To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data, we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records ( 3078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30, 780 controls ). We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For example, ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found for the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( <90 days ) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer. 
 Pancreatic cancer has been predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths, surpassing breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer ( Rahib et al., 2021 ). It has few and generic symptoms resulting in late diagnosis ( Chari et al., 2015; Kim and Ahuja, 2015 ) and poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 11% ( American Cancer Society, 2020 ). Hence, improved knowledge of symptoms and diseases occurring early is of high importance to treat this cancer type at a curable stage and provide better prognosis and guide screening programs for pancreatic cancer ( Risch et al., 2015 ). If the cancer is detected at an early stage, where surgical removal of the tumour is possible, the survival rate increases to 42% ( ‘American Cancer Society’, 2020 ). The patients with stage I disease have the highest 5-year survival of 83. 7% ( Blackford et al., 2020 ). Symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often mistaken for signs of less severe illnesses and overlooked in clinical practice. Some of the most frequent symptoms linked to pancreatic cancer are weight loss, abdominal pain, and anorexia ( Hidalgo, 2010; Mizrahi et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021 ). Others include upper abdominal pain, cholestasis, nausea ( Hidalgo, 2010 ), and dark urine and thirst ( Liao et al., 2021 ). New-onset diabetes has additionally been found to co-occur with pancreatic cancer when accompanied by weight loss ( Yuan et al., 2020; Hart et al., 2011; Bruenderman and Martin, 2015 ). National or regional disease registries hold longitudinal data on disease development. The registries in the Nordic countries are of high quality and among the oldest covering treatment in one-payer health care systems ( Laugesen et al., 2021 ). The National Danish Patient Registry ( NPR ) contains hospital diagnoses since 1977 and allows for large data-driven studies to detect temporal disease progression patterns relevant in the context of stratified medicine ( Jensen et al., 2014; Siggaard et al., 2020, Lademann et al., 2019 ). Recent examples are the characterization of multimorbidity correlations across cancer types ( Hu et al., 2019 ) and the detection of pancreatic cancer using artificial intelligence ( Placido et al., 2023 ). However, much of the deeper phenotypic patient information resides within the free text of the electronic health records ( EHRs; Jensen et al., 2012; Eriksson et al., 2014; Soguero-Ruiz et al., 2016; Delespierre et al., 2017 ). A small-scale study using 4080 mixed types of cancers attempted to build more general ‘event trajectories’ using text mining and pooled analysis ( Jensen et al., 2017 ). A prospective study investigating initial symptoms and diagnostic interval ( time from onset to diagnosis ) for known pancreatic cancer symptoms found no difference between pancreatic cancer patients and patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer ( Walter et al., 2016 ). It has also been suggested that symptoms appear sporadically, adding to the complex nature of the disease manifestation ( Evans et al., 2014 ). Other studies used primary care EHRs to detect pancreatic cancer symptoms and found jaundice ( Stapley et al., 2013 ), back pain, lethargy, and new-onset diabetes to be linked to pancreatic cancer ( Keane et al., 2014 ). These studies detected pancreatic cancer symptoms using a single-disease approach, not considering the temporal ordering of symptoms or diseases. In this paper, we present a large-scale study to investigate pancreatic cancer symptoms longitudinally. We cover all symptoms included in the International Classification of Disease ( ICD-10 ) terminology symptom chapter 18. Additionally, we also include in the text mining vocabulary other known or suggested pancreatic cancer symptoms. We generate and compare disease and symptom trajectories using registry data and clinical notes in EHRs to characterize the temporal ordering of symptoms across data sources. 
 The Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) data spans the period 1994–2018, while the electronic health records ( EHRs ) used here are from 2006 to 2016. The NPR includes 6. 9 million patients where 23, 592 patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Of these we used 18, 523 patients which also were confirmed by the Danish Cancer Registry. ( Table 1 ). For a subset of 3078 patients, we extracted their corresponding EHRs. Almost as many females as males are identified with pancreatic cancer both in NPR and the EHRs ( Table 1 ). We text-mined the pancreatic cancer patient symptom history in clinical notes five years prior to the cancer. We compared these symptoms to the most frequent symptoms in the NRP ( Figure 1 ). These are counts and show an overview of identified symptoms, which could also be present in the control population. The text mining approach was able to identify 16 unique symptoms in the clinical notes, not registered in NPR ( Figure 1A ). The most frequent symptoms exclusively found in the clinical notes were conditions related to ‘Intestinal disorders’, ‘Dorsalgia’ and ‘Embolisms’ ( Figure 1B ). NPR contained 24 ICD-10 symptoms not found by text mining ( Figure 1A ). Frequent symptoms exclusively identified in the NPR data comprised findings related to ‘Functional capacity’, ‘Dysphagia’, ‘Abnormal laboratory findings’, ‘Oedema’, and ‘Abnormal findings on medical images’ ( Figure 1C ). In NPR and free text clinical notes, 57 symptoms were identified that occurred in both sources. Of these, the 15 most frequent symptoms from the free text clinical notes and the NPR were compared ( Figure 1D ). Amongst these, we could identify ‘Pain’, ‘Nausea and vomiting’, ‘Abnormal blood-pressure reading’, ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’, and ‘Symptoms and signs concerning food and fluid intake’. From the hierarchical structure of the ICD-10 chapters, different levels of coding detail can be retrieved. In the symptom block ‘Symptoms and signs concerning food and fluid intake’, the majority of patients represent the subgroups ‘Abnormal weight loss’ ( R63. 4 ) and ‘Anorexia’ ( R63. 0 ). ‘Nausea and vomiting’, ‘Abnormal blood-pressure reading’ and ‘Weight loss’ were frequent symptoms in the free-text clinical notes, but have low occurrences in NPR. On the contrary, ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’ was more frequent in NPR than in the clinical notes ( Figure 1D ). We also compared these symptoms to well-known pancreatic cancer symptoms ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) showing that most of these are also identified via the two data types. The distribution of symptoms registered over time can be seen for the most frequent symptoms that occur significantly more often in the pancreatic cancer patients compared to the matched control cohort ( Figure 2 ). The symptom distributions are covering a five-year period before the pancreatic cancer diagnosis; the number of patients and p-values included in these can be found in Supplementary file 1c. If a symptom is registered multiple times in one hospital encounter it is only included once. All occurrences of a symptom during the five-year period are included for a patient. Some of the most frequent symptoms identified are symptoms related to ‘Pain’, ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’, ‘Nausea and vomiting’, and ‘Jaundice’. Additionally, ‘Abnormal findings on medical images’ and ‘Oema’ and ‘Abnormal laboratory findings’ were also frequent. The symptom ‘Abdom and pelvic pain’ was more frequent in the cancer patients than in the control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘Jaice’ was more frequent in the cancer patients than the control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘Nause and vomiting’ was more frequent in the cancer than the control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘Pain’ was more frequent in the cancer than the control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘Ab findings on medical images’ was more frequent in the cancer than the control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘ema’ was more in the cancer than the control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘Ab findings’ was more in the cancer than control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘O’ was more in the cancer than control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom ‘Ab’ was in the cancer than control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom’ was in the cancer than control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom was in the cancer than control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom was in the cancer control ( Figure 2 ). The symptom was the cancer control ( Figure 2 ). The was the cancer control ( Figure 2 ).

    Title: 
    Article: The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity ( 12. 5–16 Hz, adult-like ) precisely during the slow oscillation ( 0. 5–1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5–6, 8–11, and 14–18 years, and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups—but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. 
 The grouping of sleep spindles ( 9–16 Hz; Cox et al., 2017 ) into sequences of increased and decreased activity by the sleep slow oscillation ( SO, 0. 5–1 Hz; Steriade, 2006 ) during non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM ) has been recognized as an intrinsic property of the healthy, mature mammalian corticothalamic system for decades ( Contreras et al., 1996; Contreras and Steriade, 1995; Mulle et al., 1986; Staresina et al., 2015; Steriade et al., 1993 ). The joint depolarization of large groups of cortical neurons during the SO up state impinges on neurons of the reticular thalamic nucleus, there, creating conditions that facilitate thalamic spindle generation ( Steriade, 1999 ). Sleep spindles then propagate to the cortex via thalamocortical projections, where they promote synaptic plasticity through changes in calcium activity ( Niethard et al., 2018; Rosanova and Ulrich, 2005 ). Yet, little is known about how this precise coalescence develops across childhood and adolescence. Far from being an epiphenomenon, accumulating evidence suggests that the synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindles ( i. e., spindles defined in young adults with a frequency of ≈ 12. 5–16 Hz and a centro-parietal predominance; Cox et al., 2017 ) precisely during the up state of SOs provides an essential mechanism for neural communication, for example, supporting systems memory consolidation during sleep ( Hahn et al., 2020; Helfrich et al., 2018; Latchoumane et al., 2017; Mölle et al., 2002; Muehlroth et al., 2019 ). Importantly, canonical fast spindles in turn assort hippocampal ripples ( Clemens et al., 2007; Helfrich et al., 2019; Siapas and Wilson, 1998; Staresina et al., 2015 ), that code for wake experiences and are considered a reliable marker of hippocampal memory consolidation ( Buzsáki, 2015; Maingret et al., 2016; Sirota et al., 2003 ). Moreover, canonical fast sleep spindles themselves are associated with facilitated hippocampal-neocortical connectivity ( Andrade et al., 2011; Cowan et al., 2020 ). In addition to canonical fast sleep spindles, there is substantial evidence for a canonical slow sleep spindle type ( i. e., spindles defined in young adults with a frequency of ≈ 9–12. 5 Hz and a frontal predominance; Cox et al., 2017 ) in the human surface electroencephalogram ( EEG; De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Fernandez and Lüthi, 2020 ). That said, previous findings hint at a differential SO-slow spindle coupling pattern and their function is still elusive ( Klinzing et al., 2016; Mölle et al., 2011; Muehlroth et al., 2019; Rasch and Born, 2013 ). Taken together, the complex wave sequence of SO up state and canonical fast sleep spindles, together with hippocampal activity, is considered to provide the scaffold for the precisely timed reactivation of initially fragile hippocampal memory representations and their strengthening in neocortical networks ( Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Helfrich et al., 2019; Maingret et al., 2016; Staresina et al., 2015 ). However, the precise coupling of sleep spindle activity to SOs, described above, does not seem to be fully present and functional from early childhood on. Recent evidence in rodents and humans indicates that the temporal co-ordination of SOs and spindles improves across childhood and adolescence ( García-Pérez et al., 2022; Hahn et al., 2020; Joechner et al., 2021 ). Likewise, the individual neural rhythms that define the coupling undergo substantial changes during child and adolescent development. Across maturation, sleep spindles increase in occurrence and their average frequency ( Purcell et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Consistent with this, canonical slow sleep spindles were reported to mature and dominate during early childhood. In contrast, canonical fast spindles are rarely detected in young children and become increasingly present and clearly dissociable only around puberty ( D’Atri et al., 2018; Goldstone et al., 2019; Hoedlmoser et al., 2014; Shinomiya et al., 1999 ). However, amongst others, the application of individually adjusted frequency bands revealed that already young children express functional fast spindles in centro-parietal sites, whereby these manifest in a development-specific fashion ( D’Atri et al., 2018; Friedrich et al., 2019; Joechner et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Individualized rhythm detection methods provide an effective approach to capture true, dominant oscillatory rhythms despite substantial inter-individual variability, which presents a particular methodological challenge in developmental and age-comparative research ( Cox et al., 2017; Muehlroth and Werkle-Bergner, 2020 ). While canonical fast spindles become more pronounced across development, an opposite trend can be observed for SOs ( Buchmann et al., 2011; Kurth et al., 2010a ). Slow neuronal activity is initially maximally expressed and originates over posterior areas, developing towards a mature anterior predominance ( Kurth et al., 2010b; Timofeev et al., 2020 ). In summary, paralleling developmental changes in SO-spindle coupling, fast sleep spindles and SOs separately are manifested differentially across development. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how developments in sleep spindles and SOs interact to promote precise, adult-like temporal synchronization of sleep spindles during SOs across childhood and adolescence. Therefore, we aimed to ( i ) characterize the modulation of sleep spindles during SOs across different ages and ( ii ) investigate how sleep spindle and SO maturity relate to the manifestation of SO-spindle coupling across different ages. Specifically, based on previous analyses ( Joechner et al., 2021 ), we reasoned that the development of fast sleep spindles might be associated with the maturation of SO-spindle coupling. For this, we re-analyzed previously published nocturnal EEG data from a cross-sectional sample of 24 5- to 6-year-old children ( 13 female, Mage = 5 years, 10. 71 months, SDage = 7. 28 months; Joechner et al., 2021 ) and a longitudinal cohort of 33 children tested at 8–11 years of age ( T1; Hoedlmoser et al., 2014 ) and again at 14–18 years of age ( T2; 23 female, MageT1 = 9 years, 11. 70 months, SDageT1 = 8. 8 months; male Mage2 = 14, years 9. 70, SDage2 = 8. 8; Joechner et al, 202 ) and a sample of 20 to 26-year-old adults ( female Mage =22, years 9. 70, SD = 3. 8; male Mage =24, years 9. 70, SD = 3.8; Joe et al, 2017 ). We used individualized frequency bands to detect spind and SOs and calculated their coupling strength and precision across the four age groups. Our results show that fast sples in the canonical range 12.–16 Hz were present in all age groups, but less pronounced in children. In contrast, slow sples in the canonical range 9–12.5 Hz were evident in all age groups, but less precise in children. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with SO-spindle coupling strength and precision across the four age groups. Our results suggest that the ability to generate adult-like fast sples actuates precise SO-spindle patterns from childhood through adolescence and young adulthood.

    Title: 
    Article: Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes ( FMUG ), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug. amaral. northwestern. edu as a MacOS/Windows app. 
 We considered 450 genome-wide association studies ( GWAS, from studies indexed by the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog [Buniello et al., 2019] ), 296 studies using affinity purification–mass spectrometry ( AP-MS, indexed by BioGRID [Oughtred et al., 2021] ), 148 transcriptomic studies ( indexed by the EBI Gene Expression Atlas, EBI-GXA [Papatheodorou et al., 2018] ), and 15 genome-wide screens using CRISPR ( indexed by BioGRID Open Repository of CRISPR Screens, BioGRID ORCS [Oughtred et al., 2021] ) ( see PRISMA diagrams in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ). We denote genes that are found to have statistically significant changes in expression or associations with a phenotype as ‘hit’ genes. As a surrogate for a given gene having been investigated closer, we consider whether it was reported in the title or abstract of a research article. We determined which genes were mentioned in the title or abstract of articles using annotations from gene2pubmed ( Maglott et al., 2007 ) and PubTator ( Wei et al., 2019 ). We used NIH iCite v32 for citations ( Hutchins and Santangelo, 2019 ). For determining which gene properties were associated with selection as research targets, we synthesized quantitative measures from a variety of authoritative sources ( see Materials and methods ). 
 We sought to identify at which point in the scientific process understudied genes are ignored as research targets in investigations using -omics experiments ( Figure 1A ). To receive scholarly attention, a gene must travel through a pipeline from biological reality to experimental results to write-up of those results. These results must be extended by subsequent research by other scholars. Understudied genes do not progress all the way through the pipeline, but it is unclear where this leak primarily occurs. The first possibility is that some genes are less studied because they are rarely identified as hits in experiments. Prior studies have, however, shown that understudied genes are frequent hits in high-throughput experiments ( Riba et al., 2016; Haynes et al., 2018; Stoeger and Nunes Amaral, 2020 ), suggesting that this is not the case. The second possibility is that understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. The final possibility is that subsequent studies do not continue work on understudied genes revealed by the initial study. To evaluate these three possibilities, we gathered high-throughput experimental results and the titles and abstracts of articles reporting on these results, as well as the titles and abstracts of articles citing these reporting articles ( focus studies ). We then quantified the attention that ‘hit’ genes from these experiments had received by counting their occurrences in titles of abstracts within the entire biomedical literature excluding these high-throughput experiments. For example, the results for transcriptomics were obtained from 148 focus studies ( original research ) and 1678 subsequent studies ( articles citing focus articles; green boxes Figure 1B ). Those 148 studies identified 18, 295 genes to be differentially expressed in at least one experiment but, in their titles and abstracts, mentioned only 161 of those 18, 295 genes ( Figure 1B ). While the 18, 295 genes have received similar research attention as the entirety of protein-coding genes ( white box in Figure 1B ), the 161 unique hit genes mentioned in the title or abstract are significantly better studied ( p=1. 4e-61 by two-side Mann-Whitney U test ). The articles citing the focus articles also only mentioned in their titles and abstracts 692 unique genes that were differentially expressed in the cited focus study ( irrespective of whether they were reported in title or abstract of the respective cited transcriptomic study ). These 692 unique genes were similarly highly studied as those reported in the title and abstract of transcriptomic focus studies. To demonstrate that these findings are not specific to any single type of high-throughput data, we considered CRISPR screens, transcriptomics, affinity purification-mass spectrometry, and GWAS. Evaluating the first possibility that some genes are less studied because they are rarely identified as hits in experiments, we found that understudied genes were frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments ( Figure 1B ). This demonstrates, in line with earlier studies ( Riba et al., 2016; Haynes et al., 2018; Border et al., 2019; Stoeger and Nunes Amaral, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Byrne et al., 2022 ), that the lack of publications on some genes is not explained by a lack of underlying biological experimental evidence. We next evaluated the second possibility that understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. We indeed found that hit genes that are highlighted in the title or abstract are over-represented among the 20% highest-studied genes in all biomedical literature ( Figure 1B ). These trends are independent of significance threshold ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) and ( except for CRISPR screens ) whether we considered the current scientific literature or literature published before 2003, before any of these articles had been published ( Figure 1—figure supplement 6 ). We also find that this effect holds when controlling for the number of genes in each title/abstract by only considering one randomly-chosen gene per title/abstract ( Figure 1—figure supplement 7 ). Understudied genes are least frequently highlighted in the title/abstract in transcriptomics experiments and most frequently highlighted in the title/abstract in CRISPR screens. GWAS studies tend to return better-studied genes as hits; the median hit gene in GWAS studies was more studied in the biomedical literature than 75% of genes. Hit median gene highlighted in the title/abstract in GWAS studies was more studied in the biomedical literature than 85% of all protein coding genes. This may explain the prior observation that the total number of articles on individual genes partially correlates with the total number of occurrences as a hit in GWAS studies ( Stoeger et al., 2018 ). Evaluating the final possibility, we found that the reception of -omics studies in later scientific literature either reproduced authors’ initial selection of highly studied genes or slightly mitigated it. Jointly, the above findings reinforce that understudied genes become abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. The abandonment of understudied genes could be driven by the valid concern of biomedical researchers that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact ( Kustatscher et al., 2022 ), as observed around the turn of the millenium ( Pfeiffer and Hoffmann, 2007 ). If this were the case, preemptively avoiding understudied hits would be the rational decision for authors of -omics studies. We thus decided to complement our preceding analysis by an analysis explicitly focused on citation impact. Notably, we found that the concern of publications on understudied genes receiving fewer citations does not hold for present-day research on human genes; in biomedical literature at-large, articles focusing on less-investigated genes typically accumulate more citations, an effect that has held consistently since 2001 ( Figure 2 ). Further, since 1990, articles about the least popular genes have at times been three to four times more likely to be among the most cited articles than articles on the most popular genes whereas articles on the most popular genes have been slightly less to be highly cited than lowly cited ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). To rule out that these macroscopic observations stem from us having aggregated over different diseases, we separately analyzed the citation counts for each of the 18, 295 genes that were differentially expressed in at least one transcriptomic study ( Figure 2— supplement 2 ). We found that articles on understud genes received more citations than articles on better-stud genes ( p=. 0. 01 by two-sided Mann-Whitney U test ). We also found that articles on understud genes were more likely to be among the top-cited articles ( Figure 2— supplement 3 ). The effect of understud genes receiving more citations is not limited to transcriptomics but also observed in CRIS screens ( Figure 2— supplement 4 ) and affinity-massrometry ( Figure 2— supplement 5 ). We also found that articles on understud genes were more likely to be among top-cited ( Figure 2— supplement 6 ). These findings suggest that understud genes are not abandoned because they are less likely to yield high-impact articles, but rather because they are less likely to be highlighted in titles and abstracts of articles. To promote the investigation of understud genes, we condense our insights into a tool, find understud genes ( FM ) that allows scientists to engage with bias during selection of hits. FM is available as a MacOS/Windows app and can be downloaded at fm. amal. north. western edu. edu. We demonstrate the utility of FM through the identification of understud genes in vertebrate aging. 
The article discusses the problem of understudied genes in high-throughput experiments and how they are abandoned in favor of better-stud genes.

They also find that understud genes receive more citations than betterud genes and are more likely to be among top-cited. The authors suggest that understud genes are abandoned because they are less likely to be highlighted in titles and abstracts rather than because they are less likely to yield high-impact articles.

Title: Investigating the Understudied Genes in High-Throughput Experiments: A Systematic Analysis of Bias in Gene Selection

High-throughput experiments, such as genome-wide association studies, transcriptomics, and CRISPR screens, have identified numerous genes associated with biological processes and diseases. However, many of these genes remain understudied and abandoned in favor of better-stud genes. Our analysis reveals that understud genes are frequently found as hits in high-through experiments but not highlighted in titles and abstracts of articles. We also find that understud genes receive more citations than betterud and are more likely to be topited. This suggests that underst genes are abandoned because they are less likely to be highlighted in titles and abstracts rather than because they are less likely to yield high-impact articles. We provide a tool, FM, to help scientists engage bias during selection of hits and demonstrate its utility through the identification of underst genes in vertebrate aging.

The study analyzed 450 genome-wide association studies, 296 transcriptomic studies, and 15 genome screens using CRPR. We found that understud genes are frequently as hits in-through experiments but not highlighted in titles and abstracts of articles. We also found that underst genes receive more citations than betterud and are more likely to be topited. This effect is observed in all types of high-through data, including transcriptomics, CRPR, and affinity-massrometry. We suggest that underst genes are abandoned because they are less likely to be highlighted in titles and abstracts rather than because they are less likely to yield high articles. We provide a tool, FM, to help scientists

    Title: 
    Article: Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms. 
 Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) encompasses a group of chronic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Among patients with DM, cardiovascular complications, especially the direct and indirect effects of hyperglycemia on the human vascular network, persist as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality ( de Matheus et al., 2013 ). The harmful effects of hyperglycemia are closely associated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease ( Fox et al., 2004; Rask-Madsen and King, 2013 ). Endothelial cell dysfunction is a systemic pathological state exhibiting disrupted integrity, adhesion, altered proliferation capacity, migration, tube formation, and more ( Flammer et al., 2012; Kolluru et al., 2012 ). High blood glucose levels over long periods have been demonstrated to be associated with vascular dysfunction both in vivo and in vitro ( Tesfamariam et al., 1990; Ting et al., 1996 ). The epidemiological evidence has indicated the positive correlation between risks of cardiovascular disease and DM with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) and 100% fruit juices, thereby emphasizing the concerns for the adverse effects of sugar intake on cardiometabolic risk factors, regardless of whether the sugar is added or naturally occurring ( Imamura et al., 2015; Malik, 2017; Narain et al., 2016; Larsson et al., 2014; Fung et al., 2009 ). Artificially sweetened beverages ( ASBs ), which incorporate noncaloric sweeteners or low-caloric additives, have been suggested as healthy alternatives to SSBs ( Fakhouri et al., 2012 ). ASBs contain sugar alcohols and polyols, such as sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, mannitol, erythritol, isomalt, and lactitol. The consumption of ASBs worldwide has gradually increased in recent years ( Fakhouri et al., 2012; Sylvetsky et al., 2012; Moriconi et al., 2020 ). However, accumulating studies in the last decade suggested that ASB consumption might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes ( Fung et al., 2009; de Koning et al., 2012; Fagherazzi et al., 2013; Gardener et al., 2012; Drouin-Chartier et al., 2019; de Koning et al., 2011; Hirahatake et al., 2019; Mossavar-Rahmani et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these findings remain insufficiently documented. The zebrafish has been recognized as a valuable animal model for studying metabolic diseases, such as hyperglycemia and diabetic complications, due to its functional conservation in glycol metabolism, pancreas structure, glucose homeostasis, adipose biology, and genetic similarities to mammals ( Zang et al., 2018; Barros et al., 2008; Elo et al., 2007 ). The combination of embryonic transparency and transgenic lines, wherein endothelial cells are labeled specifically with fluorescent proteins, facilitates the high-resolution imaging analysis of vascular formation in vivo. Immersion of zebrafish in glucose solution has been found to induce diabetic complications, including vascular dysfunction ( Gleeson et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2010; Jörgens et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2016 ). Several recent studies have investigated the effects of high glucose on vascular function in the zebrafish model ( Jung et al., 2016; Heckler and Kroll, 2017; Jörgens et al., 2015 ). However, the association between noncaloric monosaccharides and vascular dysfunctions, such as excessive angiogenesis, has not been elucidated. Here, we have successfully established a short-term zebrafish model that exhibits significantly excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) induced by glucose treatment. Using this model, we examined the effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development and investigated the molecular mechanisms. Our results provided new evidence for the negative roles of caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides on vascular development. 
 To establish the short-term zebrafish hyperangiogenenic model induced by high glucose treatment, we immersed the Tg ( fli1aEP:EGFP-CAAX ) ntu666 embryos, a transgenic line wherein the endothelial cells were labeled with membrane-bound GFP ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), in glucose solution within a wide range of concentrations and time windows ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). We subsequently measured the glucose concentration in the embryos. We found that the glucose concentration in the embryos treated with high glucose was significantly higher than that in the control group ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). We observed that exposing zebrafish embryos at either 24 hr post fertilization ( hpf ) or 48 hpf to a 6% D-glucose treatment for a duration exceeding 48 hr led to dramatically increased formation of blood vessels ( Figure 1, Videos 1 and 2 ), especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ) in the indicated area ( Figure 1b ). The hyperbranched endothelial cells were observed to sprout from existing vessels, including the ISVs, dorsal aorta ( DA ), and dorsal lateral anastomotic vessel ( DLAV ) ( Figure 1 ) in embryos treated with high glucose. Additionally, these ectopically branched angiogenic sprouts were not perfused by blood flow. Despite the abnormal vessel formation, no significant developmental defects were observed in these treated embryos when examined under a bright-field microscope ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–c ). Moreover, no excessive angiogenic phenotype was observed in the embryos treated with 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% D-glucose within the corresponding time frame ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ). Fructose is a ketonic monosaccharide that is an energy source for living organisms. Therefore, our study investigated the potential effects of fructose on vascular dysfunction in comparison to glucose. The result demonstrated fructose-induced excessive angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Wondering whether the effects of glucose and fructose on vascular development were mediated by metabolic events, we then conducted the same tests by using other noncaloric monosaccharides, including L-glucose, D-mannose, D-ribose, and L-arabinose, which animals could not digest. Interestingly, we observed that all these noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive angiogenesis, among which the L-glucose purchased from two companies resulted in a similar phenotype as efficiently as D-glucose did ( Figure 2a–h ). To rule out the effect of osmotic pressure, we treated zebrafish embryos with isotonic disaccharides, including lactose, maltose, and sucrose, which did not cause a significant excessive angiogenic phenotype ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4d and h; Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). However, higher concentration disaccharide treatment can also cause excessive angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). In addition, we also tested the effects of pyruvic acid but did not observe the excessive angiogenic phenotype in the embryos treated with pyruvic acid solution at 50 nM to 50 μM concentration ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ). Furthermore, we examined the arterial and venous identity of the hyperbranched vessels via live imaging ( Figure 2— supplement 5 ) and found that the hyperbrched vessels were predominantly venous in nature ( Figure 2— supplement 6 ). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and nonoricoscharides, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells ( ECs ) in embryos exposed to high glucose ( Figure 3 ). We found that the ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and series of proangiogenic genes were upregulated ( Figure 3— supplement a–c ). Moreover, the expression of marck1 was significantly upregulated ( Figure 3— supplementd ). To determine whether fox1 mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by nonoscharides, we knocked down fox1 in ECs using morpholinos ( Figure 4 ) and observed reduced angiogenesis ( Figure 4— supplement ). Furthermore, we found that fox1 upregulated the expression of mar1 in ECs ( Figure 4— supplement ). These results suggested that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by upregulating mar1 in ECs. In conclusion, this study provided new evidence for the negative effects of nonoric and caloric monoschar on vascular development and the underlying mechanisms. The excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and nonoschar was mediated by fox1 upregulation of mar1 in ECs. This study highlights the importance of considering the effects of nonoric and caloric sweeteners on vascular health.

    Title: 
    Article: Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences, yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory ( WM ). To achieve efficient memory storage, relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information. Here, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. Crucially, we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories. First, sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Second, sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories, and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Finally, neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior. Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, together facilitating efficient information organization in WM. 
 A well-known feature of working memory ( WM ) is its limited capacity ( Baddeley, 2000; Cowan, 2001 ), which constrains the amount of information that can be temporarily retained for future behavior. Meanwhile, in daily experiences, memorized items do not exist independently but are always part of a common framework or share the same structure, which could be leveraged to compress information and overcome the WM capacity challenge ( Brady et al., 2011 ). For example, while shopping at a supermarket, numerous items could be grouped into a few categories, such as drinks, vegetables, fruits, and meats, to facilitate memory. Other types of abstract associations such as relational regularities and structure schema could also mediate WM organization ( Al Roumi et al., 2021; Gathercole and Baddeley, 2014; Mathy and Feldman, 2012 ). Computational modeling also suggests that higher-order structures ( e. g. summaries and relative relations ) would reduce memory uncertainty by constraining individual-item representations ( Brady and Tenenbaum, 2013; Ding et al., 2017 ). Cognitive maps, as one type of spatial schema ( Farzanfar et al., 2023; Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017 ), provide a general structure framework for organizing information in different tasks and across various domains ( Tolman, 1948; Whittington et al., 2020 ). They were first identified as representations of physical maps during navigation, but recently have been shown to also support other higher-level processes, such as conceptual knowledge, reasoning, planning, and decision-making ( Behrens et al., 2018; Bellmund et al., 2018; O’keefe and Nadel, 1978 ). Two major neural signatures of cognitive maps, grid-like code ( Constantinescu et al., 2016; Doeller et al., 2010; Hafting et al., 2005; Park et al., 2021 ), and neural replay in the hippocampal-entorhinal system ( Foster and Wilson, 2006; Liu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021b; Schuck and Niv, 2019; Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996 ), are identified in both spatial and non-spatial tasks. Neural replay, the rapid item-by-item reactivation in a forward or backward direction, is posited to not only repeat past experiences, but also reflect an internal model of the world ( Kurth-Nelson et al., 2023; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2018 ). Accordingly, many higher-level processes could be described as mental explorations of a sequence of states within an abstract map, similar to tracing a route on a physical map. As a result, a cognitive map can serve as a common reference for aligning different features or domains. In line with the view, conjoined cognitive maps have been recently revealed in the rodent hippocampus ( i. e. physical space and abstract task variables ) ( Nieh et al., 2021 ), and alignment of different feature maps speeds learning performance ( Aho et al., 2022 ). Moreover, both spatial and conceptual distances are relied on to generalize when searching for correlated rewards in value-guided learning, supporting a cognitive-map-dependent computational mechanism ( Wu et al., 2020 ). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that cognitive maps might be employed to reorganize memory information across domains to overcome capacity bottlenecks in WM. Here, we examined whether cognitive maps shared by multiple feature domains would be naturally leveraged to make efficient use of limited WM capacity. To address this question, participants were asked to memorize a color sequence presented at a list of spatial locations and later reproduce both the color and location sequences on two rings, one after another. In other words, subjects need to retain in WM two sequences of features, i. e., color and location, both of which could be characterized as sequence trajectories along their respective rings on a spatial map. Crucially, we manipulate the consistency between color and location sequence trajectories on the rings. Specifically, for the aligned condition, the color and location sequence share a common spatial trajectory, i. e., separated by the same distance between successive items between maps ( Figure 1B ), whereas, for the misaligned condition, they have distinct relative trajectories ( Figure 1C ). We hypothesize that humans would spontaneously combine the structure shared by the two sequences to facilitate memory formation, even though it is unsupervised and non-mandatory. To preview the results, we provide converging behavioral and neural evidence for spontaneously leveraging common structures to facilitate WM. Behaviorally, sequences with consistent color-location trajectories ( aligned condition ) show enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. Neurally, aligned location-color sequences demonstrate reactivation of shared trajectory during both encoding and retention periods and interestingly, spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling location sequences. Together, shared common structures enable the storage of multiple sequences in WM through compressed encoding and neural replay. 
 Thirty-three human participants performed a visual sequence WM task while their brain activities were recorded using EEG. As shown in Figure 1A, at the beginning of each trial, three disks with different spatial locations and colors were sequentially presented. Participants were required to concurrently remember their locations and colors as well as their orders, i. e., one location sequence and one color sequence. After a 2 s memory delay, a gray ring ( location ring ) was presented to instruct participants to prepare for subsequent location sequence recall without making motor responses ( Figure 1A, ‘recall location’ period ). This is to ensure memory signals are decoded without explicit motor interventions. Next, a cursor appeared at the center of the screen ( ‘response period’ ), and participants clicked the three spatial locations on a ‘location ring’ in their correct order. Upon completion of location recall, participants were instructed to prepare for color sequence recall ( ‘recall color’ ), and they clicked three locations on the color ring based on the color sequence ( ‘response period’ ). One key aspect was manipulating the consistency between location and color trajectories so that the two sequences share or do not share a common structure in a cognitive map. Specifically, in the aligned trajectory condition ( AT condition ), despite the location and color sequences occupying different positions within their respective rings, their trajectory distances ( between first and second items and between second and third ) were the same ( Figure 1B ). In other words, by rotating certain angles, the three points in the two rings can exactly match, and the rotated angles varied from trial to trial, which allowed us to separately decode the location sequence and color sequence in the following analysis. In contrast, the location and color sequences in the misaligned trajectory condition ( MAT condition ) differed both in positions and trajectory distances within rings ( Figure 1C ). We first estimated memory precision for color and location sequences by calculating the reciprocal of the circular standard deviation of response error ( circular difference between reported location ( color ) and correct location ( color ) ) across trials ( 1∕σ ) ( Bays et al., 2009 ). As shown in Figure 2A, two-way repeated ANOVA ( alignment ( AT vs. MAT ) ×task ( location vs. color ) ) revealed significant main effects for alignment ( F ( 1, 32 ) = 4. 279, p=0. 047, ηp2 = 0. 118 ) and task ( F ( 1, 32 ) = 139. 382, p<0. 001, ηp2 = 0. 813 ), but nonsignificant interaction effect ( F ( 1, 32 ) = 0. 618, p=0. 438, ηp2 = 0. 019 ). Specifically, the AT condition had better memory performance than the MAT condition, supporting our hypothesis that shared structure facilitates memory of multiple sequences. Moreover, location memory performed better than color memory. Further comparison revealed that the aligned condition mainly enhanced color memory ( paired-t test, t ( 32 ) = 2. 446, p=0. 020, Cohen’s d=0. 426 ) but not location ( paired-t test, t ( 32 ) = 1. 538, p=0. 134, Cohen’s d=0. 268 ). Better location vs. color memory performance indicates that alignment operation is less effective in improving memory ( i. e. location sequence ) that is already well-represented in memory. Next, we examined the correlation between color and location trajectories during encoding and retention periods. As shown in Figure 3A, the aligned condition showed a significant positive correlation between color and location trajectories ( r = 0., p < 0.001 ) whereas the misaligned condition did not ( r = 0., p = 0. 0 ). This suggests that the shared structure between color and location sequences is reactivated during both encoding and retention periods. Finally, we investigated spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling location. As shown in Figure 4, the aligned condition exhibited replay of color sequences when recalling location ( r = 0., p 0.001 ) whereas the misaligned did not ( r = 0, p 0. 0 ). This indicates that the shared structure between color and location is replayed when recalling location. Together, these results suggest that shared structures are leveraged for storage of multiple sequences in WM through compressed and neural replay.

    Title: 
    Article: Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome. In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance. In this study, we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. 
 The family of purine-rich element-binding ( PUR ) protein is highly conserved from plants to humans ( Molitor et al., 2021 ). Among the three vertebrate paralogs PURA, PURB, and PURG, the best-studied family member is PURA ( Bergemann and Johnson, 1992; Haas et al., 1993; Haas et al., 1995 ). It is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in several cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational gene regulation as well as mRNA transport in neurons ( Chepenik et al., 1998; Gallia et al., 2001; Haas et al., 1993; Haas et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2000; Mitsumori et al., 2017; Tretiakova et al., 1999 ). Results from two independent knock-out mouse models demonstrated that PURA is important for postnatal brain development ( Hokkanen et al., 2012; Khalili et al., 2003 ). Accordingly, PURA has been implicated as a modulator of neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ( FXTAS ), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder ( Swinnen et al., 2020 ). PURA was reported to be present in the pathological RNA foci of both disorders and to protect against RNA toxicity upon ectopic overexpression ( Mori et al., 2013; Rossi et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2018; Swinnen et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2013 ). In addition, PURA was shown to co-localize with an ALS-causing variant of the FUS protein in stress granules of ALS patients. Importantly, overexpression of PURA reduced the toxicity of mutant FUS by preventing its mis-localization ( Daigle et al., 2016 ). In 2014, two studies reported that a monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by sporadic mutations in the PURA gene ( Hunt et al., 2014; Lalani et al., 2014 ). Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties, among others ( Reijnders et al., 2018; Johannesen et al., 2021 ). Mutations causing PURA syndrome are often frame-shift events but also point mutations distributed over the entire sequence. Based on the crystal structures of PURA from Drosophila melanogaster ( dmPURA ), three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I, II, and III were identified to fold into globular domains ( Graebsch et al., 2010; Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ). Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions, two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA. All these PUR domains belong to the class of the PC4-like protein family, which mainly bind single-stranded nucleic acids and can unwind double-stranded DNA and RNA ( Janowski and Niessing, 2020 ). Although both PUR domains possess the typical PC4-like β-β-β-β-α- ( linker ) -β-β-β-β-α topology, the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be the main RNA/DNA interaction entity ( Weber et al., 2016 ). In a previous study, homology models based on the dmPURA crystal structures ( Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ) were used to predict in silico the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein ( Reijnders et al., 2018 ). While these mutations could be classified into groups that likely either do or do not impair the structural integrity of PURA, these predictions remained speculative ( Reijnders et al., 2018 ). Surprisingly, in contrast to phenotypically related genetic diseases such as the Rett syndrome ( Lombardi et al., 2015 ), no hot-spot regions could be identified in the protein sequence that trigger the PURA syndrome. With the exception of the unstructured N-terminal region and the very C-terminus, almost all mutations across the protein sequence appear to result in the full disease spectrum ( Johannesen et al., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 ). To date, we fail to understand why there is such an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome. In this study, we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity. When studying the impact of patient mutations on PURA’s subcellular localization, we observed impaired processing body ( P-body ) association but close-to normal localization to stress granules, indicating a potential importance of P-bodies for PURA syndrome pathology. Two particularly interesting disease-causing variants, K97E and R140P, were further analyzed by structural means. The results indicated that the N-terminal PUR domain is unusually flexible in its fold and prone to misfolding upon mutation. In summary, we provide a structure-based explanation for the underrepresentation of genetic variations with mild symptoms in patients and a rational approach for predicting and functionally testing genetic variations of uncertain significance. 
 Several patient-related genetic variations are frame-shift events and thus predictably destroy the integrity of PURA. In addition, a number of point and indel mutations have been reported for which the pathology-causing effects are less easy to predict ( Johannesen et al., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 ). To understand their functional impact, we decided to first study the effect of three known patient variations, K97E, I206F, and F233del ( Hunt et al., 2014; Lalani et al., 2014; Reijnders et al., 2018; Figure 1A ), on the subcellular localization of hsPURA. Previous studies in human cell cultures indicated that hsPURA localizes to stress granules upon cellular stress and may be essential for their formation ( Daigle et al., 2016; Markmiller et al., 2018 ). To analyze whether the afore-mentioned patient-related genetic variations affect the localization of hsPURA to stress granules, the mutant and wild-type versions of full-length FLAG-tagged hsPURA were overexpressed in HeLa cells using a doxycycline-inducible expression cassette and cells were stressed for 1 hr with 500 µM sodium arsenite ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1B ). To find out whether stress-granule localization of hsPURA depends on its nucleic acid-binding properties, we also utilized an RNA-binding-deficient version of hsPURA bearing 11 structure-guided point mutations ( m11 ) as a control ( for rationale and design of this mutant, see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Using an anti-FLAG tag antibody, we observed wild-type hsPURA to be distributed within the cytoplasm and accumulated in stress-granule structures, as seen by co-staining with the stress-granule marker G3BP1 ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, the nucleic acid-binding-deficient mutant hsPURA m11 failed to co-localize to G3BP1-positive granules, indicating that RNA binding by hsPURA is necessary for its co-localization with stress granules. Furthermore, all three versions of hsPURA bearing patient-derived genetic variations localized to stress granules upon cellular stress ( Figure 1B ). In all three patient-related variants, no significant reduction of PURAs stress-granule association was seen when compared to the wild-type control ( Figure 1C ). To assess the previously reported influence of hsPURA on stress-granule formation at endogenous PURA levels ( Daigle et al., 2016 ), we performed a small interfering ( si ) RNA mediated knockdown of hsURA in HeLa cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). siRNA-mediated knockdown of hsURA resulted in reduced stress-grule formation as seen by co-staining with G3BP ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ), indicating that endogenous hsURA is involved in stress-grule formation. We then tested whether the patient-related mutations affect hsURA’s ability to localize to P-bodies ( Figure 1— supplement 4 ). In contrast to wild-type hsURA, hsURA bearing the mutations K97, I206, and Fdel failed to co-localize with P-bodies ( Figure 1— supplement 4 ), indicating that these mutations impair hsURA’s ability to associate with P-bodies. To understand the structural basis of this effect, we solved the crystal structures of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of hsURA ( Figure 2A and 2B ) and performed molecular dynamics simulations ( Figure 2C and 2 ) as well as nuclear magnetic resonance measurements ( Figure 2D and 2 ). The N-terminal domain was found to be highly flexible and prone to misfolding upon mutation ( Figure 2C and 2 ), whereas the C-terminal domain was relatively stable ( Figure 2 and 2 ). The C-terminal domain was found to be involved in dimerization of hsURA ( Figure 2 and 2 ), consistent with previous studies on dmURA ( Grabs et al,2010; Weber et al,2016 ). The N-terminal domain was found to be involved in RNA binding ( Figure 2 and 2 ) consistent with previous studies on dmURA ( Weber et al,2016 ). In contrast to the C-terminal, the N-terminal was found to be highly dynamic and prone to misfolding upon mutation ( Figure 2 and 2 ). These results suggest that the N-terminal is particularly susceptible to mutations that impair its structural integrity. This is consistent with previous predictions based on homology models ( Reijers et al,2018 ) and may explain why even conservative mutations in the N-terminal result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome. The C-terminal domain was found to be relatively stable and involved in dimerization of hsURA ( Figure 2 and 2 ) consistent with previous studies on dmURA ( Gra et al2010; Weber et2016 ). The N-terminal was found to be involved in RNA binding ( Figure and 2 ) consistent with previous onURA ( et2016 ) In contrast the N-terminal the C-terminal was found to be dynamic and prone to misolding upon mutation ( and 2 ) These results suggest that the N-terminal is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity.

    Title: 
    Article: Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration. 
 Sweating is a vital physiological process ( Shibasaki and Crandall, 2010 ). There are two basic types of sweating: thermoregulatory and emotional sweating, in addition to gustatory sweating, largely localized to the face and neck regions, that occurs while consuming some foods, particularly pungent foods ( Lee, 1954 ). Most sweat glands are of the eccrine type, and they produce a thin secretion that is hypotonic to plasma. Although eccrine sweat glands are distributed all over the body, their density is highest in the axillary region and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. In humans, the main function of eccrine sweat glands is body temperature regulation. Meanwhile, apocrine sweat glands are found primarily in the axillae and urogenital regions. These scent glands become active during puberty and secrete a viscous fluid that is associated with body odor. Body temperature regulation is important to maintain homeostasis. Body temperature is poorly controlled in patients with hypohidrosis. Meanwhile, patients affected by hyperhidrosis can have difficulty in social and professional situations due to increased sweat production, and the resulting subjective perception of illness at an individual level may be substantial ( Cohen and Solish, 2003; Schlereth et al., 2009 ). However, the molecular mechanisms of perspiration are not clearly understood. We previously reported the functional interaction between TRP channels and the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel, anoctamin 1 ( ANO1, also known as TMEM16A ) ( Takayama et al., 2014; Takayama et al., 2015; Derouiche et al., 2018 ). TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability ( Gees et al., 2012 ), and Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels activates ANO1 by making a physical complex, leading to Cl- efflux in cells with high intracellular Cl- concentrations. The Cl- efflux may drive water efflux through water channels in exocrine gland acinar cells that increase exocrine function and causes depolarization in primary sensory neuron that increases nociception. For skin keratinocytes that have relatively low intracellular Cl- concentrations, interaction between TRPV3 and ANO1 causes Cl- influx, followed by increased cellular movement/proliferation in response to cell cycle modulation ( Yamanoi et al., 2023 ). Thus, direction of Cl- movement through ANO1 is simply determined by the balance between equilibrium potentials of Cl- and membrane potentials in each cell ( Takayama et al., 2019 ). The involvement of TRPV4 in exocrine gland function prompted us to examine the functional interaction in perspiration because TRPV4 is expressed in human eccrine sweat glands ( Delany et al., 2001 ). Although sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons, acetylcholine ( Ach ) is released from the nerve endings ( Hu et al., 2018 ). We show that the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and increased friction force. 
 We detected expression of TRPV4, ANO1, and the water channel aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) in the eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. The secretory coil is located in the deep dermis and a relatively straight duct opens to the skin surface. We first validated an anti-TRPV4 antibody that we generated. This anti-TRPV4 antibody conspicuously labeled the basal layer of the epidermis, secretory eccrine gland cells, and duct cells only in skin from wild-type ( WT ) mice, but not in skin from TRPV4-deficient ( TRPV4KO ) mice ( Figure 1A ), indicating the antibody specificity. TRPV4 was clearly localized in secretory glands as confirmed by positivity for cytokeratin 8 ( CK8 ), a secretory cell marker ( Figure 1B ). The duct cells were not labeled by ANO1 and CK8 ( Figure 1B ). TRPV4-immunoreactivity was stronger in duct cells near the secretory region and gradually diminished in the distal excretory ducts toward the epidermis. Bilayered sweat ducts showed TRPV4 labeling in basal cells but not suprabasal cells ( Figure 1C ). Secretory cells in human eccrine glands are classified into two types: clear cells that mainly secrete water and electrolytes, and dark cells that secrete macromolecules like glycoproteins. We found that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells were positive for the calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ), a dark cell marker, and were heterogeneously labeled ( Figure 1D ). This result is consistent with earlier studies showing that mouse eccrine glands have a more primitive structure than human glands and have only one type of secretory cell that resembles human clear cells but also has dark cell characteristics ( Kurosumi and Kurosumi, 1970; Bovell, 2018 ). To explore TRPV4 subcellular localization, we observed tissues using Airyscan super-resolution imaging. TRPV4 was heterogeneously labeled in the gland cells and showed apparent localization in basal and apical membranes ( Figure 1D ). TRPV4 was absent in myoepithelial cells. Conspicuous co-labeling of TRPV4 and ANO1 or AQP5 with filamentous actin ( F-actin ) was seen at the apical site ( luminal side ) of the secretory cells ( Figure 1E ). These close topological relationships clearly suggest that TRPV4, ANO1, and AQP5 would be able to form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. These results also suggest that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components as well as the secretion of water and ions. We previously showed the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 in the heterologous expression with HEK293T cells and mouse native exocrine gland acinar cells ( Takayama et al., 2014; Derouiche et al., 2018 ). Then, we examined functional TRPV4 expression in sweat glands in mouse foot pads. WT mouse sweat glands responded to the TRPV4 agonist, GSK ( 500 nM ), and to Ach ( 10 μM ) ( Figure 2A ). No cytosolic Ca2+ increase induced by GSK was observed in sweat glands from TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, the GSK-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was significantly inhibited by menthol ( 5 μM ) in WT mouse sweat glands, suggesting that menthol inhibited TRPV4 function. Meanwhile, menthol alone caused no change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ( Figure 2C ). These data indicate functional expression of TRPV4 in mouse secretory cells. To examine the functional interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in mouse sweat glands in vivo, stimulated sweating induced by Ach ( 100 μM, 2 min ) in mouse hind paws at 25 and 35°C was investigated using an iodine and starch reaction to measure secreted amylase ( Nejsum et al., 2002 ). At 25°C, no difference in stimulated sweating was seen both in WT and TRPV4KO mice while sweating was increased at 35°C in WT, but not in TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 3A ). Temperature-dependent basal sweating without Ach stimulation for 15 min was also observed in WT mice, but not in TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 3B ). Menthol, a well-known TRPM8 activator, inhibits ANO1 function ( Takayama et al., 2017 ). The ability of menthol to inhibit Ach-stimulated sweating at 35°C in WT mice ( Figure 3C ) and basal sweating at 25 and 35°C in TR4 mice ( Figure 3D ) suggests that TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interaction with AN1. To examine the role of AN1 in perspiration, basal sweating without Ach stimulation was inhibited by the AN1 inhibitor ( 1 μM ) in WT and TR4 mice ( Figure 3E ). These results indicate that AN1 is involved in perspiration in eccrine glands of mouse pads. To examine the role of TR4 in perspiration in vivo, we tested the ability of mice to climb a slippery slope. WT mice climbed the slope more easily than TR4 mice ( Figure 4 ). This result suggests that TR4 is involved in maintaining friction in mouse foot pads, which is consistent with the idea that TR4 is involved in perspiration. Finally, we examined TR4 expression in human skin from patients with acquired generalized anhidrosis ( AIG ). TR4 expression was significantly higher in normidrotic skin from patients with AIG compared to anhidrotic skin from AIG ( Figure 5 ). This result suggests that TR4 may be involved in perspiration in human skin. In conclusion, TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interaction with AN1, and TR4 or the TR4/AN1 complex would be a target for agents that regulate pers.

    Title: 
    Article: The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2. 5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. 
 The universal scaling law Equation 1 can be rewritten in a suggestive way ( 2 ) AtA0= ( AeA0 ) 1. 25, where the A0=T2k4 is a fundamental area element that defines the threshold between gyrencephaly ( folded cortex ) and lissencephaly ( smooth cortex ) when At=Ae=A0. For a constant k the value of A0 is a multiple of T2, indicating that cortical thickness determines the size of the smallest possible gyri and sulci. This re-writing highlights a new perspective, or interpretation of the scaling law: it now suggests a relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic measures of cortical size ( given the folded laminar structure of the cortex, areas are the more natural way of measuring its ‘size’ ), At and Ae, respectively, measured in units of A0. This is reminiscent of fractal scaling ( Mandelbrot, 1983 ), where a complex shape reveals ever smaller levels of self-similar detail as it is probed in ever smaller scales ( or equivalently, higher resolutions ), represented here by A0. The scaling, or power exponent between the measured intrinsic and extrinsic sizes is the so-called fractal dimension. Although actual fractals are mathematical abstractions, they can often be defined as the limit of iterative processes. Many structures in nature, and in particular biology ( Elston and Zietsch, 2005; Codling et al., 2008; Ionescu et al., 2009; Losa, 2011; Klonowski, 2016; Di Ieva, 2016; Reznikov et al., 2018 ), are good approximations of a fractal. Equation 2 is suggestive, but not proof, that cortices are among these forms, with a fractal dimension of 1. 25×2=2. 5 ( the factor 2 being the topological dimension of areas ). Indeed, fractal scaling for various aspects of cortical morphology has often been postulated ( Free et al., 1996; Kiselev et al., 2003 ), with a number of recent papers making use of MRI data ( Marzi et al., 2021; Jao et al., 2021; Meregalli et al., 2022; Díaz Beltrán et al., 2024 ). Most recently published estimates of fractal dimension for the whole cortex are indeed close to 2. 5 ( King et al., 2010; Madan and Kensinger, 2016; Madan and Kensinger, 2017; Marzi et al., 2020 ). Here, for the first time, we propose to directly construct morphologically plausible realisations of cortices at any specified spatial scale, or resolution. This is achieved through a coarse-graining method that removes morphological details smaller than a specified scale while preserving surface integrity. For example, at a set scale of 3 mm, sulcal walls that are less than 3 mm apart would be removed, and the neighbouring gyri would be fused. This method is a new systematic way of obtaining shape properties from the cortex in terms of a sequence of morphometric measurements as spatial scale varies. By examining how areas scale across coarse-grained versions of actual primate cortices, we will be able to directly verify cortical self-similarity. 
 As a starting point for a coarse-graining method, we suggest to turn to a well-established method that measures a fractal dimension of objects: the so-called box-counting algorithm ( ). Briefly, this algorithm fills the object of interest ( the cortex in our case ) with boxes, or voxels of increasingly larger sizes and counts the number of boxes in the object as a function of box size. As the box size increases, the number of boxes decreases; and in a log-log plot, the slope of this relationship indicates the fractal dimension of the object. In our case, this method would not only provide us with the fractal dimension of the cortex, but, with increasing box size, the filled cortex would also contain less and less detail of the folded cortex. Intuitively, with increasing box size, the smaller details below the resolution of a single box would disappear first, and increasingly larger details will follow – precisely what we require from a coarse-graining method. We, therefore, propose to expand the traditional box-counting method beyond its use to measure the fractal dimension, but to analyse the reconstructed cortices as different realisations of the original cortex at the specified spatial scale. Concretely, our proposed method requires the bounding pial and white matter surfaces of the cortical ribbon as input. We obtained these surfaces based on reconstructions from magnetic resonance imaging data in 11 different primate species. Algorithmically, we then segment the space between the original pial and white matter surfaces into a 3D grid of boxes of the desired scale λ, where each box is a cube of dimensions λ×λ×λ. We also term the 3D grid of cubes ‘voxelisation, ’ as it effectively captures the cerebral cortex as voxels in 3D space ( Figure 1B bottom row ). At any given scale, or voxel size, this process effectively erases morphological features ( folds ) that are smaller than the cube size. Visually, increasing the voxel size appear as if the cortex is ‘melting’ and ‘thickening’ ( Figure 1, and videos: https://bit. ly/3CDoqZQ ). A more technical and detailed description and discussion of the algorithm is provided in Appendix 1. Note this method has also no direct dependency on the original MR image resolution, as the inputs are smooth grey and white matter surface meshes reconstructed from the images using strong ( bio- ) physical assumptions and, therefore, containing more fine-grained spatial information than the raw images ( see also Appendix 2 ). Morphological properties, such as cortical thicknesses measured in our ‘melted’ brains are to be understood as a thickness relative to the size of the brain. Therefore, to analyse the scaling behaviour of the different coarse-grained realisations of the same brain, we apply an isometric rescaling process that leaves all dimensionless shape properties unaffected ( more details in Appendix 3. 1 ). Conceptually, this process fixes the voxel size, and instead resizes the surfaces relative to the voxel size, which ensures that we can compare the coarse-grained realisations to the original cortices, and test if the former, like the latter, also scales according to Equation 1. Resizing, or more precisely, shrinking the cortical surface is mathematically equivalent to increasing the box size in our coarse-graining method. Both achieved an erasure of folding details below a certain threshold. After rescaling, as an example, the cortical thickness also shrinks with increasing levels of coarse-graining, and never exceeds the thickness measured at native scale. To better characterise the coarse-grained cortices in terms of their similarity in offset, we use a previously introduced ( Wang et al., 2021 ) a set of independent measures, K, I, and S, that summarise the morphometry of the cortex in a natural and statistically robust way. In this framework, isometrically scaled copies of the same morphometry all map onto a line along the I=log⁡At+log⁡Ae+log⁡T2 direction, which is perpendicular to a K×S plane that fully summarises their shape. K=log⁡At−54log⁡Ae+14log⁡T2 is the direction defined by the offset k of the scaling law Equation 1, while direction S=32log⁡At+34log⁡Ae−94log⁡T2 captures the remaining information about shape, and can be regarded as a simple measure of morphological complexity. Wang et al., 2021 provides a detailed derivation and demonstration of the superior sensitivity and specificity of these new morphometric measures. The advantage of using this framework here is that we can assess the offset K ( and shape term S ) without interference by isometric size effects, including any re-scaling procedures. With the exception of the marmoset data, all other cortical surface reconstructions were based on healthy individual brains. The comparative neuroanatomy dataset for different mammalian species is the same as previously published ( Mota and Hercul,2018 ). The dataset includes 11 primate species and 70 other mammalian species, including rodents, carnivores, ungulates, and marsupials. All reconstructions were based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data, with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 mm and 0. 5 mm in the plane and 0. 5 mm in the third dimension. All reconstructions were performed using the Freesurier et al. 2019 algorithm. The dataset is available at https://github.com/cortical-morphology/neuroanatomy. The cortical reconstructions were then used as input for our coarse-graining method, which was implemented in Python and available at https://github.com/cortical-morph/coarseaining. We used a range of scales from 0.5 to 5 mm in steps of 0. 5 to coarseain the cortices. For each scale, we computed the morphometric measures K and S, as well as the fractal dimension using the box-counting algorithm. The results are shown in Figure 2.

    Title: 
    Article: The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC. 
 The NF-κB transcription factor RELA is an essential mediator of the inflammatory and immune responses in all mammals ( Hayden et al., 2006 ) and is central to the canonical NF-κB signalling pathway ( Ghosh et al., 1998 ). As a transcription factor, RELA activation is controlled in large part through its localisation. Inactive RELA is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins and IκB degradation by upstream cues, such as the potent inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor α ( TNFα ), enables RELA translocation to the nucleus where RELA regulates gene expression ( DiDonato et al., 1997; Zandi et al., 1997 ). Live imaging experiments of fluorescently labelled RELA and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that RELA oscillates between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to TNFα ( Hoffmann et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2004; Sung et al., 2009; Tay et al., 2010; Sero et al., 2015; Zambrano et al., 2016 ). Oscillations are driven by a negative feedback loop between RELA and particular IκB isoforms since the genes encoding IκB proteins are RELA transcriptional targets ( Brown et al., 1993; Scott et al., 1993; Sun et al., 1993; Hoffmann et al., 2002 ). The pattern of RELA translocation has been shown to dictate the specificity and timing of RELA target gene expression, including the genes encoding IκBα, IκBε, and the chemokine RANTES ( Ashall et al., 2009; Zambrano et al., 2016; Lane et al., 2017 ). Previously, we showed that cell shape is a regulator of RELA dynamics in breast cancer cell lines and that breast cancer cells with mesenchymal cell shape ( protrusive with low cell–cell contacts ) have higher RELA nuclear translocation ( Sero et al., 2015 ). We also identified that RELA activity, coupled to cell shape, is predictive of breast cancer progression ( Sailem and Bakal, 2017 ). Although the mechanistic basis for how cell shape regulates RELA remains poorly understood, studies have shown that chemically inhibiting actin or tubulin dynamics can increase RELA binding to DNA and RELA-dependent gene expression ( Rosette and Karin, 1995; Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001; Németh et al., 2004 ). Despite frequent upregulation of both TNFα and RELA in PDAC tumours ( Weichert et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2016 ), the dynamics and regulation of single-cell RELA translocation, as well as RELA transcriptional output, are poorly understood for PDAC cells. Here, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to tag RELA with GFP in the human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 and identified rapid, non-oscillatory, and heterogeneous RELA dynamics by live imaging. To explore potential cytoskeletal or cell shape regulation of RELA in PDAC, we constructed Bayesian models using single-cell datasets from TNFα-stimulated PDAC cells with variation in RELA, actin, and tubulin measurements for hypothesis generation: one dataset with five PDAC cell lines and another with diverse small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components. Notably, nuclear RELA was statistically predicted as dependent on actin features across Bayesian models. Finally, we used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based on dependence on TNFα dose and RELA activation. Using live imaging with knockdown of selected targets, our results uncover novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB. 
 To study PDAC biology, we used the frequently studied human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1, which harbour key genomic alterations in PDAC, including KRAS and p53 mutations and homozygous deletions in CDKN2A/p16 ( Deer et al., 2010 ). In addition, MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells are epithelial in origin but have distinct cell morphologies and are therefore useful for analysis of cell shape interaction with RELA. To study dynamic RELA localisation changes, we used CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing to fluorescently tag endogenous RELA at the C-terminus with eGFP ( abbreviated as RELA-GFP ) ( Figure 1A and B ). The C-terminus was selected to avoid interference with the N-terminal Rel homology domain, which contains the transactivation, nuclear import and DNA-binding domains ( Kieran et al., 1990; Nolan et al., 1991 ). GFP+ clones were selected using FACS, single-cell sorted and expanded into monoclonal cell lines. We also introduced mScarlet-I to the C-terminus of PCNA ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen; abbreviated as PCNA-Scarlet ) – a processivity factor for DNA polymerase δ that functions during replication – which served as a nuclear marker for segmentation and as a cell cycle marker ( Kurki et al., 1986; Barr et al., 2017; Figure 1A and B ). To observe live RELA translocation dynamics in response to inflammatory stimuli, we used timelapse confocal microscopy with automated image analysis to track changes in RELA-GFP localisation on a single-cell level in response to TNFα ( 0. 01, 0. 1, and 10 ng/ml ), from –120 min to +600 min relative to TNFα addition. 0. 01 ng/ml TNFα is a physiological dose relevant to healthy and malignant tissue, while 0. 1 ng/ml TNFα is detected in highly inflammatory PDAC microenvironments ( Zhao et al., 2016 ). 10 ng/ml TNFα was used in several studies assaying RELA translocation ( Hoffmann et al., 2002; Tay et al., 2010; Sero et al., 2015 ) and is included for comparison, but is substantially above physiological levels ( Zhao et al., 2016 ). Broadly, we observed a lack of oscillatory nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, in addition to general maintenance of nuclear RELA across the 10 hr imaging period. MIA PaCa2 cells responded with higher nuclear RELA compared to PANC1 cells at each TNFα dose ( Figure 1C ). Peak nuclear RELA, quantified as the first timepoint at which the slope of the single-cell RELA track ≤ 0, was statistically significantly different between 0. 01 and 0. 1 ng/ml for MIA PaCa2 but not for PANC1 cells, suggesting that MIA PaCa2 cells are more sensitive to TNFα dose in terms of RELA activation ( Figure 1D ). 10 ng/ml TNFα elicited a significantly higher nuclear RELA localisation amplitude in both cell lines compared to lower TNFα doses ( 0. 01 and 0. 1 ng/ml ). In contrast, TNFα dose did not affect the time to peak RELA in MIA PaCa2 cells, while PANC1 cells displayed a slower time to peak at 0. 01 ng/ml TNFα compared to higher doses ( Figure 1E ). We also compared RELA measurements within each single-cell track to assess the stability of nuclear RELA levels ( Figure 1F ) and found that M Pa2 cells exhibited higher variability in nuclearA compared to P1 cells at 0.01 and 0.1 ng TNα ( Figure 1G ). These results suggest that M Pa2 cells are more responsive to TNα in terms of REL dynamics, with higher amplitude and variability, while P1 cells are less responsive with lower amplitude and less variability. We used Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets from TNα-stimulated PDAC with variation in REL, actin, and tubulin measurements to explore cytoskeletal or cell regulation of REL in PDAC ( Figure 2 ). We constructed two models : one with five PD cell lines and another with small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components. Notably, REL was statistically dependent on act features across Bayesian models ( Figure 2 ). We used RNA-seq to identify genes with patterns of expression based on TNα dose and REL activation ( Figure 3 ) and found distinct clusters of REL-regulated genes in PD cells including TNα-induced upregulation of act regulators NU2 and ARHG31 ( Figure 3 ). siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHG31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL in PD cells establishing a novel feedback loop that regulates REL by TNα ( Figure 4 ). We characterised the NF-κ pathway in PD cells identifying NFκ/Iκ proteins and physically interact with REL in absence of TNα ( Figure 5 ) and in presence TNα ( Figure 6 ) Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support interdependence between the F-act network and NFκ pathway REL translocation in PDAC.

    Title: 
    Article: A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ), the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs. 
 Maintaining a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory ( E/I ) neurotransmission is critical for optimal brain function ( Tao et al., 2014 ). Disruptions in this balance are commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders ( Bozzi et al., 2018; Coghlan et al., 2012; Oblak et al., 2009 ). In particular, deficits in inhibitory ( GABAergic ) signaling have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and other related physiopathological conditions ( Oblak et al., 2009; Gogolla et al., 2009 ). PTEN is a classical tumor suppressor gene that antagonizes the highly conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( PKB/Akt ) pathway. Several reports using animal models have highlighted the importance of PTEN in neurodevelopment ( Rademacher and Eickholt, 2019; van Diepen and Eickholt, 2008; Kwon et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2016; Clipperton-Allen and Page, 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Clipperton-Allen et al., 2022 ). Moreover, mutations in PTEN were frequently found in human patients presenting ASD ( Butler et al., 2005 ). The molecular events underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits in PTEN mutants remain poorly understood. The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) motor neurons regulate muscle contraction and relaxation, provides an excellent platform for studying the function, balance, and coordination between excitatory and inhibitory signals ( Huang et al., 2019b; Vashlishan et al., 2008; Zhou and Bessereau, 2019; Safdie et al., 2016; Stawicki et al., 2011; Opperman et al., 2017; Giles et al., 2019 ). This system has yielded valuable insights into fundamental synaptic transmission mechanisms ( Blazie and Jin, 2018; Calahorro and Izquierdo, 2018 ). Over the last decade, numerous studies focused on this simple yet highly informative system have significantly contributed to our understanding of the functioning and dysregulation of human genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and familial hemiplegic migraine ( Huang et al., 2019b; Opperman et al., 2017; Giles et al., 2019; Bessa et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, the substantial conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans ( Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998; Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998 ) enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment. We here found that mutations in daf-18 ( the ortholog for PTEN in C. elegans ) result in impairments in GABAergic inhibitory signaling due to decreased activity of the transcription factor DAF-16 ( the ortholog for FOXO in C. elegans ) during neurodevelopment. Interestingly, cholinergic excitatory motor neurons remain unaffected. This targeted impairment of inhibitory signals causes an imbalance between E/I neurotransmission in the animal’s neuromuscular system. In humans, ketogenic diets ( KGDs ), which force fatty acids beta-oxidation into ketone bodies, have been utilized for decades to treat pathologies associated with E/I imbalances, such as refractory epilepsies ( D’Andrea Meira et al., 2019; Neal et al., 2008; Lambrechts et al., 2017 ). More recently, KGDs have also demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating autistic symptoms in humans ( Li et al., 2021 ) and rodent models of ASD ( Castro et al., 2017; Verpeut et al., 2016 ). The mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain largely unknown. We demonstrated that exposing daf-18/PTEN mutants to a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate ( βHB ) early in development enhances DAF-16/FOXO activity, mitigates morphological and functional defects in GABAergic neurons, and improves behavioral phenotypes. This study not only provides a straightforward system for studying the role of the conserved PI3K/Akt/FOXO pathway in neurodevelopment but also contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of ketone bodies in neurodevelopment. 
 Disturbances in C. elegans cholinergic or GABAergic activity can be detected by analyzing the sensitivity to the paralyzing effects of drugs that exacerbate cholinergic transmission ( Huang et al., 2019b; Vashlishan et al., 2008 ). We analyzed the sensitivity of daf-18/PTEN-deficient animals to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb and the cholinergic agonist levamisole. Exposure to aldicarb leads to an increase in ACh levels at cholinergic motor synapses, resulting in massive activation of muscular cholinergic receptors and subsequent paralysis ( Mahoney et al., 2006 ). Levamisole also induces paralysis by directly activating muscular cholinergic receptors ( Mahoney et al., 2006; Figure 1A ). We found that daf-18/PTEN mutants are hypersensitive to the paralyzing effects of both drugs ( Figure 1B, C ). Hypersensitivity to cholinergic drugs is typical of animals with an increased E/I ratio in the neuromuscular system, such as mutants in unc-25 ( the C. elegans ortholog for glutamic acid decarboxylase, an essential enzyme for synthesizing Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid [GABA] ) ( Huang et al., 2019b; Vashlishan et al., 2008 ). While daf-18/PTEN mutants become paralyzed earlier than wild-type animals, their hypersensitivity to cholinergic drugs is not as severe as that observed in animals completely deficient in GABA synthesis, such unc-25 null mutants ( Figure 1B, C ) indicating a less pronounced imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. Reduced activity of DAF-18/PTEN has been largely shown to exacerbate the PI3K pathway, precluding the activation of DAF-16/FOXO, the C. elegans ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors family ( Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We analyzed aldicarb and levamisole sensitivity of mutants in this transcription factor. Similar to daf-18/PTEN mutants, we found that daf-16/FOXO null mutants are hypersensitive to the paralyzing effects of aldicarb and levamisole ( Figure 1C ). Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in aldicarb and levamisole sensitivity between daf-18;daf-16 double null mutants and the respective single mutants, suggesting that both genes affect neuromuscular signaling by acting in the same pathway ( Figure 1C ). In addition to daf-16/FOXO and daf-18/PTEN, we assessed the sensitivity to the paralyzing effects of aldicarb and levamisole in loss-of-function mutants of other components of the PI3K pathway, such as age-1/PI3K, pdk-PI3K, and age-2PI3K ( Figure 1 ). We observed hypersensitivity to aldic and levamole in age-1PIK and age-2PIK mutants, but not p-PIK mutants ( Figure 1 ). These results indicate that the PIK/Akt pathway plays a critical role in neuromus signaling and that d-16/FOX and d-18/EN act in this pathway to regulate GABAergic function. The PIK/Akt pathway is conserved in C elegans and mammals ( Parad and Rk,1998; O and Rk,199 ) and has been implicated in neurodevelopment ( Rademacher and Eickolt,2019; vanpen and Eickolt,2008; Kwon et al,2006; Smith et al,2016; Clerton-Allen and Page,2014; Chen et al,2015 Clerton-Allen et al,202 ). In mammals, PI3/Akt signaling is involved in cell survival, growth, and metabolism. In C elegans, the PI/Akt pathway has been shown to regulate neuromus signaling ( Huang et al,2019b; Vlishan et al,2008; Zhou Bessau,2019; Safdie et al,2016 Stic et al,2011; Opp et al,2017; Giles et,2019 ). Our results suggest that the PI/Akt pathway also regulates GABAergic function in C eleg. elegans and that d-16/FOX and d-18EN act in this pathway to modulate inhibitory signaling. The PI/Akt pathway has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD ( Butler et al,2005 ). Our study highlights the importance of the PI/Akt pathway in GABAergic function and the role of d-FOX and d-EN in this process. The PI/Akt pathway has been shown to regulate cell survival, growth, and metabolism in mammals. In C elegans, PI/Akt regulates neurom signaling ( Huang et al,2019; Vlish et al,2008; Bessau,2019;die et al,2016 Stic et,201; Opp et,201; Giles,201 ) Our results suggest that PI/Akt also regulates GABAergic function in C elegans and d-FOX d-EN act in this pathway to modulate inhibitory. The PIkt pathway has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD ( Butler et al2005 ) Our study highlights the importance of PIkt in GABAergic function and the role dFOX dEN in this process The PIkt has been shown to regulate cell survival, growth, and metabolism in mammals In C eleg PIkt regulates neurom ( et al2019; Vlish et200; Bessau201;die et al201; Stic et201; Opp; et201 Giles ) Our suggest PIkt also regulates GABA in C and dFOX dEN in this to modulate inhib The PIkt has been implicated in neurodisorders including ASD ( et2005 ) Our study the importance PI in GABA and role dFOXEN this PIkt been shown regulate cell, growth, and in mammals In C eleg PIkt neurom (2019; Vlish200; Bess;die et201; St; Opp; Giles ) Our suggest PIkt GABA and dFOX in this modulate PIkt been implicated neurodis ASD (200 ) Our study the PI in GABA dFOX PIkt been regulate cell, growth, in mammals In C eleg PIkt neu (201; V; Bessdie; et; St; Giles ) suggest PIkt GABA dFOX modulate PIkt been implicated neurodis ASD (200 Our study the PI in GABA dFOX PIkt regulate cell growth, in mammals C PIkt neu (

    Title: 
    Article: Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection has spread globally, with at least 755 million people diagnosed and the death toll is over 6. 8 million. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron, continue to evolve and increase transmissibility and the ability to escape host immune responses. These variants have presented significant challenges to the design and development of vaccines and therapeutic agents ( Zhou et al., 2020 ). In order to discover novel strategies to control the virus, it is important to understand host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cell-cell fusion ( also known as syncytia formation ) in multiple cell types including lung epithelial cells, neurons, and glia ( Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023 ). Syncytia formation between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with neighboring cells may contribute to increased viral transmission and pathogenicity in the infected host ( Rajah et al., 2022 ), which also makes the virus insensitive to extracellular neutralizing antibodies ( Li et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023 ). Moreover, syncytia formation among pneumocytes with long-term persistence of viral RNA has been observed in the lung autopsy of deceased COVID-19 donors, which may contribute to prolonged clearance of the virus and long COVID symptoms ( Bussani et al., 2020 ). Therefore, inhibiting syncytia formation is critical to ensure viral clearance and to control viral transmission. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2-mediated syncytia formation is effectively inhibited by multiple interferon ( IFN ) -stimulating genes ( ISGs ) ( Pfaender et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020 ). However, low IFN levels with impaired ISG responses were observed during early SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have compromised the antiviral responses of IFN in severe COVID-19 patients ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020 ). Thus, identifying other endogenous host factors that regulate syncytia formation is of great significance for harnessing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, a variety of cells are involved in the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Ren et al., 2021 ). Lung epithelial cells are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which subsequently recruit and activate innate immune cells, leading to COVID-19 pathology ( Barnett et al., 2023 ). In this process, tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes contribute to local and systemic inflammation primarily by releasing inflammatory cytokines ( Sefik et al., 2022 ). Among these cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2, the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induces inflammatory cell death, resulting in clear tissue damage, while other cytokines’ function remains obscure ( Karki et al., 2021 ). In addition, when corticosteroids were applied to suppress the inflammatory response in patients infected by SARS-CoV ( Lee et al., 2004 ) or MERS-CoV ( Arabi et al., 2018 ), the clearance of viral RNA was obviously delayed, suggesting the importance of innate immune factors in viral clearance. Innate immune cells express Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ), and TLR-mediated signaling induces robust production of inflammatory cytokines ( Medzhitov, 2001 ). In the current work, we screened the role of soluble proinflammatory cytokines on the SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Notably, we identified that IL-1β, which is the key factor of inflammatory response, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia formation in various cells by activating RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells. Importantly, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice in vivo. Therefore, our data highlight an important role for proinflammatory cytokines against viral infection. 
 We have previously established quantitative and qualitative models for SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion by bioluminescence assay, immunoblotting, and fluorescence imaging ( Yu et al., 2022 ). In order to explore the potential effect of cytokines on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, human monocyte cell line THP-1 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were used in this study. We applied several TLR ligands to stimulate such innate immune cells and collected the cell culture supernatants for subsequent experiments ( Figure 1A ). Of note, cell culture supernatants of THP-1 cells stimulated by TLR ligands significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal, while neither untreated THP-1 cell culture supernatant nor the medium control had any effect on the bioluminescence signal reflecting cell-cell fusion ( Figure 1B ). SARS-CoV-2 spike engagement of ACE2 primed the cleavage of S2’ fragment in target cells, a key proteolytic event coupled with spike-mediated membrane fusion ( Yu et al., 2022 ). In parallel with bioluminescence assay, a large amount of enriched S2’ cleavage was detected in HEK293T-Spike and HEK293T-ACE2 co-cultured group and co-culture incubated with untreated THP-1 cell culture supernatant, while S2’ cleavage was clearly reduced upon treatment with TLR ligands-stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants ( Figure 1C ). Syncytia formation was also visualized using cells co-expressing spike and a ZsGreen fluorescent reporter. The area of syncytium were significantly reduced by the treatment with TLR ligands-stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants ( Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). Considering the presence of TLR ligands in such cell culture supernatants, we tested their potential direct effects. As expected, TLR ligands alone did not reduce the bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage compared to the control groups, as well as no effect on syncytia formation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E ). Concurrently, we also tested the effect of PBMCs culture supernatants on SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Consistent with the results from THP-1 cells, TLR ligands-stimulated PBMCs culture supernatants treatment also strongly reduced the bioluminescence signal, S2’ cleavage, and the area of syncytium compared with the medium group ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I ). These results thus suggested that activated innate immune cells released host factors to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. To validate the effect of innate immune cell culture supernatants on cell-cell fusion in authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we pre-treated ACE2-expressing cells with THP-1 cell culture supernatants before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 B. 1. 617. 2 ( Delta ) or wild-type ( WT ) strains. Cell lysates were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and N protein 24 hr post-infection ( hpi ) ( Figure 1E ). Result from this experiment showed that TLR ligands-stimulated-THP-1 cell culture supernatants reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein levels during Delta or WT SARS-CoV-2 infection in HEK293T-ACE2 cells, whereas untreated THP-1 cell culture supernatant had no effect ( Figure 1F, Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ). In addition, TLR ligands-stim-TH-1 cell supernatants inhibited syncytia formation in HEK-293-ACE cells infected with SARSV-2 B.1. 617. 2 or WT ( Figure 1G, Figure 1— supplement 2 ). These results indicate that innate cell supernatants can inhibit SARSV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. To identify the cytokine responsible for the effect of innate cell supernatants on SARSV-2-induced cell fusion, we screened cytokines in TLR-stimulated TH-1 cell culture supernatants by ELISA ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) ( Figure 2A ). IL-1β was the most abundant cytokine detected in TLR-stim TH-1 supernatants, while other cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ were present at lower levels ( Figure 2B ). IL-1 is a key proinflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 ( Blanco-Melo et al, 202; Hadadj et al,202 ). To investigate the effect of IL-1 on SARSV-2-induced cell fusion, we treated HEK-293-ACE cells with IL-1 before inoculation with SARSV-2 B.1. 617. 2 or WT. Cell lysates were used for the detection of SARSV-2 spike and N protein 24 hpi ( Figure 2C ). Result showed that IL-1 significantly reduced S’ cleavage and N protein levels during Delta or WT SARSV-2 infection HEK-293-ACE cells ( Figure 2D, Figure 2— supplement ). In addition, IL-1 inhibited syncia in HE-293-ACE cells infected with SARS-2. B. 1. 617 2 or WT ( Figure 2, Figure 2— supplement ). These results indicate that IL-1 inhibits SARSV-2-induced cell fusion in authentic SARSV-2 infection. To explore the mechanism of IL-1 on SARSV-2-induced cell fusion, we examined the signaling pathway of IL-1 in HEK-293-ACE cells ( Figure 3 ) IL-1 binds to its receptor IL-1R1R on the surface of HEK-293-ACE cells ( Figure 3A ). IL-1R1R is a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-1R1R1 and IL-1R3 subunits ( Figure 3 ). Upon IL-1 binding to IL-1R1R, IL-1R1R undergoes autophosphorylation ( Figure 3 ) and activates the downstream signaling pathway ( Figure 3 ). We found that IL-1 activates the Rho/RO signaling pathway in HE-293-ACE cells ( Figure 3, Figure 3— supplement ). Rho is a small GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell motility ( Hall, 2005 ). In HEK-293-ACE cells treated with IL-1 showed enrichment of actin bundles at cell-cell junctions ( Figure 3, Figure 3— supplement ) which prevented syncia formation ( Figure 3, Figure 3— supplement ). To confirm the role of R/RO signaling in IL-1-mediated inhibition of SARSV-2-induced cell fusion, we treated HE-293-ACE with Rho inhibitor Y-27632 before inoculation with SARS-2. 1.617 2 or WT. Cell lysates were used for the detection SARS-2 spike and N protein 24 hpi ( Figure 3 ) Result showed that Y-32 inhibited

    Title: 
    Article: Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation. To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity, we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings. We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity. IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast to feeding, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. Contrary to IPCs, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Taken together, we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state. 
 Insulin is a key neuropeptide that controls metabolic homeostasis across the animal kingdom ( Barbieri et al., 2003; Brogiolo et al., 2001; Garofalo, 2002; Jin Chan and Steiner, 2000 ). Beyond metabolic homeostasis, insulin signaling is implicated in physiological processes underlying reproduction, aging, and stress resistance ( Broughton et al., 2005; Partridge et al., 2011; López-Otín et al., 2013 ). When nutrients are abundant, insulin promotes the uptake and storage of energy. Conversely, during periods of starvation, insulin release is downregulated ( Cahill, 2006; Abdul-Ghani et al., 2006 ), which promotes the conservation of energy resources and enables energy mobilization via counter-regulatory pathways ( Carlson et al., 1994; McCue, 2010; Finn and Dice, 2006 ). Maintaining this energy balance is vital for survival. Accordingly, dysregulation of this finely tuned system is a hallmark of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes ( DeFronzo, 1988; Hull et al., 2004; Kahn, 2003 ). Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a model system to study insulin signaling because of the availability of a powerful genetic toolkit ( Bellen et al., 2010; Baker and Thummel, 2007; Morris et al., 2012; Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021; Park et al., 2014; Jennings, 2011 ). In Drosophila, 14 IPCs, which are analogous to human pancreatic beta cells, reside in the pars intercerebralis ( PI ) of the brain ( Nässel and Winther, 2010 ). These IPCs secrete Drosophila insulin-like peptides ( DILPs ) and are sensitive to changes in the metabolic state ( Fridell et al., 2009; Kim and Neufeld, 2015; Barber et al., 2016; Géminard et al., 2009 ), the behavioral state ( Liessem et al., 2023 ), the circadian time ( Barber et al., 2016; Barber et al., 2021 ), aminergic and peptidergic modulatory inputs ( Luo et al., 2012; Held et al., 2024 ), and other peripheral signals ( Nässel and Vanden Broeck, 2016 ). Consequently, they play a key role in orchestrating the metabolic demands of behaving animals. For instance, insulin acts as a global cue for modulating odor-driven food-search in accordance with the fly’s nutritional state ( Root et al., 2011 ). Unlike pancreatic beta cells, IPCs are localized in the brain and engage in direct synaptic signaling ( Held et al., 2024; Nässel et al., 2013 ) in addition to endocrine signaling. Thus, IPCs are part of a complex system that integrates both neuronal and peripheral signals. As a key hub integrating metabolic state information, IPCs are thought to be part of the neuronal circuitry that regulates food intake ( Root et al., 2011; Marella et al., 2012; Pathak and Varghese, 2021; Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010; Brent and Rajan, 2020; Yang et al., 2015; Jourjine et al., 2016 ), in part by regulating foraging behavior. Previous studies found that octopamine, the insect analogue to norepinephrine, mediates starvation-induced hyperactivity in flies ( Yang et al., 2015 ). A subset of octopaminergic neurons expressing Drosophila insulin receptor ( dInR ) are necessary for the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity ( Yang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016 ) implicating that IPCs play a role in modulating foraging behavior. While much is known about carbohydrate metabolism and insulin signaling in Drosophila ( Broughton et al., 2005; Enell et al., 2010; Kapan et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2014 ), the in vivo dynamics of IPCs remain largely elusive. Ex vivo studies indicate that IPCs themselves are sensitive to glucose, as evidenced by increased firing rates upon glucose perfusion ( Fridell et al., 2009; Kréneisz et al., 2010 ). However, the influence of feeding and nutritional state changes on IPC activity in vivo, as well as the nutritional state-dependent response of IPCs to glucose, remain unclear, underscoring the importance of in vivo studies where all nutrient-sensing and sensorimotor circuits are intact. For instance, how does IPC activity differ when glucose is ingested as part of a meal, compared to when glucose is administered directly to the brain or into circulation? In mammalian systems, insulin release is significantly amplified upon glucose ingestion vs. intravenous administration ( Elrick et al., 1964; DeFronzo et al., 1978 ), a phenomenon known as the ‘incretin effect’ ( Creutzfeldt, 1979; Kazafeos, 2011 ). This underlines the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. Here, we investigated the nutritional state-dependent modulation of IPCs in Drosophila using an in vivo electrophysiological approach. We recently demonstrated that IPC activity is strongly modulated by locomotion on fast timescales ( Liessem et al., 2023 ). Whether the converse is true, and IPC activity can directly affect behavior on short timescales, is not clear. To address this, we optogenetically manipulated IPCs and other modulatory neurons while recording the locomotor activity of freely walking flies. In combination, our approaches show that IPC activity is not just nutritional state-dependent, but that IPCs also exhibit an incretin-like effect. We further establish that the nutritional state strongly modulates locomotor activity, and that IPCs play a small but significant role in this. In addition, we confirm that another set of modulatory neurons adjacent to the IPCs, DH44PINs, are sensitive to glucose perfusion. While DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity on short timescales, DH44 neurons outside the PI ( DH44Ns ) form strong inhibitory connections to IPCs. These DH44Ns also have strong effects on locomotor activity, which are antagonistic to those of IPCs. Our findings imply distinct mechanisms by which IPCs and DH44PINs sense changes in nutritional state, underlining the significance of multiple pathways in orchestrating Drosophila’s response to nutritional state changes and ensuring metabolic homeostasis. 
 To characterize the electrophysiological activity of IPCs in different nutritional states, we performed in vivo patch-clamp recordings from IPCs in fed and starved Drosophila ( Figure 1A–C ). First, flies were fed ad libitum, and the IPC baseline activity was determined by recording their spontaneous activity in glucose-free extracellular saline in a 5 min window. The baseline firing rate varied between individual IPCs and ranged from 0 to 1. 4 Hz ( Figure 1D ). To assess the effect of starvation on IPC activity, we wet-starved flies for 24 h. IPCs were significantly less active in starved flies than in fed flies with a median firing rate of 0 Hz ( Figure 1D ). Hence, the IPC population was basically quiescent after starvation. We also analyzed the resting membrane potential ( Vm ) of IPCs in fed and starved flies. On average, IPCs in starved flies had a more depolarized m than those in fed flies ( Figure 1E ). To determine the effect of feeding on IPC activity, we fed flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, or non-nutritive sugars. Glucose and fructose significantly increased IPC activity ( Figure 1F ), whereas nonutrit sugars had no effect. In contrast, perfusion of glucose did not affect IPC activity ( Figure 1 ). This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous administration. To investigate the effect of feeding on locomotor activity, we optogenetically manipulated IPCs and recorded the locomotor activity of freely walking flies ( Figure 2 ). We found that activating IPCs reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity ( Figure 2 ) whereas activating DHNs increased hyperactivity ( Figure 2 ). These results demonstrate that IPC and DHNs are part of a modulatory network that maintains homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in metabolic state.

    Title: 
    Article: Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ). We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells. 
 Since GFP was first described as a fluorescent reporter ( Chalfie et al., 1994 ), the use of fluorescent proteins has become a standard method to study the localization and function of proteins inside living cells. Generally, reporter protein fusions are transiently or stably expressed from exogenous plasmids carrying their own promoter. However, expression levels can be quite high and variable from these strong, non-specific promoters ( Husser et al., 2022 ). Further, over-expression can induce artifacts of localization and protein-protein interactions, making data challenging to interpret ( Gibson et al., 2013; Mahen et al., 2014 ). With the advent of gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9, the genes encoding fluorescent proteins can now be inserted directly into the genome at a desired locus ( Bukhari and Müller, 2019; Husser et al., 2021 ). CRISPR/Cas9 is used to introduce a double-stranded break at the target site, which can be repaired by homology-directed repair ( HDR ) using a repair template carrying the fluorescent marker ( Verma et al., 2017 ). With this approach, the protein of interest is still expressed from its endogenous promoter, fused with the fluorescent protein. This enables the study of proteins at endogenous expression levels and provides more reliable measurements of protein behavior ( Dambournet et al., 2018; Doyon et al., 2011; Husser et al., 2022; Mahen et al., 2014 ). Endogenous tagging is commonly done in model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which whole-genome libraries of endogenous tags have been generated ( Huh et al., 2003 ). However, gene editing in human cells is less widely used due to limitations in efficiency caused by transfection and HDR, among other issues. Because of these bottlenecks, the majority of human proteins have not been tagged and studied at the endogenous level. Although several efforts have been made to tag multiple proteins endogenously in various human cell lines ( e. g. Husser et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2017 ), the generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput. The recently developed self-complementing split fluorescent proteins can be used as tools for large-scale endogenous tagging ( Feng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2019; Kamiyama et al., 2016; Tamura et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020 ). In the split mNeonGreen system, the mNeonGreen protein is expressed as two separate fragments: a large fragment composed of the first ten beta-strands of mNeonGreen ( mNG21-10 ) and a short fragment corresponding to the eleventh beta strand ( mNG211; Feng et al., 2017 ). The two fragments have been engineered to form a functional fluorescent protein when co-expressed ( Feng et al., 2017 ). This interaction is characterized by a high complementation efficiency and is irreversible once the reconstituted protein has folded ( Feng et al., 2019; Köker et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the split mNeonGreen2 protein retains most of the brightness of the original mNeonGreen ( Feng et al., 2017 ). This system allows for easy and efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in cells where mNG21-10 is constitutively expressed ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016; Mahdessian et al., 2021 ). The mNG211 fragment is only 16 amino acids long, so it can be inserted into the genome by HDR using a repair template with short homology arms ( generally 40–80 bp ), which can be purchased commercially as a single-stranded oligo-deoxynucleotide ( ssODN ). This enables large-scale tagging using commercially synthesized ssODNs and sgRNAs to target multiple proteins in parallel ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016 ). However, this approach requires the generation of a parental cell line that constitutively expresses the mNG21-10 fragment. This has been done by random lentiviral integration followed by antibiotic selection, which is fast but generates a heterogeneous population where the expression of the large fragment is inconsistent across the cell population and is subject to epigenetic silencing ( Cabrera et al., 2022 ). Large-scale endogenous tagging in HEK293 cells was recently achieved by the OpenCell project, with 1310 proteins tagged to date ( Cho et al., 2022 ). However, while this library will be a valuable resource for the community, there is a need to study protein function in other cell types, where the mechanisms regulating biological processes could vary drastically. Since their discovery in 2007, human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) have become a popular tool to study human cells in developmental contexts and to identify disease-causing mutations, amongst other valuable applications ( Shi et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2007 ). iPSCs are derived from somatic cells that are reprogrammed to be self-renewing and pluripotent. These cells can be cultured and differentiated into any desired cell type in vitro using specific protocols ( e. g. Grancharova et al., 2021; Hong and Do, 2019; Oceguera-Yanez et al., 2022 ). Despite this incredible resource, few studies have investigated cellular processes in human stem cells and differentiated cell types with high spatiotemporal resolution ( Dambournet et al., 2018; Viana et al., 2023 ). For example, several studies describe the regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis in mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells ( Chaigne et al., 2020; Chaigne et al., 2021; Paim and FitzHarris, 2022 ), but not in human stem cells. Since most of our knowledge of human cell cytokinesis is derived from diseased and/or transformed cell lines, the field will benefit greatly from studying iPSCs before and after differentiation in an isogenic context, particularly since they represent ‘healthy’ human cells ( Dambournet et al., 2018; Drubin and Hyman, 2017 ). Here, we used the split mNeonGreen system for endogenous tagging in human iPSCs ( Figure 1A ). First, we engineered a human iPS cell line that constitutively expresses the mNG21-10 fragment. We validated this cell line extensively and named it ‘smNG2-P’ ( split mNeonGreen2 parental cell line ). As a proof-of-concept, we efficiently targeted multiple genes for endogenous tagging with mNG211, and clonally isolated several tagged iPS cell lines. To facilitate this process, we developed protocols for efficient single-cell isolation by FACS ( fluorescence-activated cell sorting ) and screening of edited clones by Nanopore sequencing. Finally, we show how the endogenously tagged iPS cell lines can be used for live imaging studies of cytokinesis, which is a highly dynamic cellular process. Timelapse imaging of several weakly expressed cytokinesis genes that were endogenously tagged in iPSCs revealed new insights into how cytokinesis occurs in these cells. Imaging the more weakly expressed genes required the use of an image restoration algorithm to alleviate cell toxicity and obtain high-quality images with high temporal resolution. This work provides the foundation for a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells and provides protocols to efficiently generate and study endogenous tags in human iPSCs. 
 Our first goal was to generate a human iPS cell line where mNG21-10 is constitutively expressed. To do this, we generated a repair template that contains a mNG21-10 expression cassette for integration into the AAVS1 locus, based on a previously published design ( Figure 1B; Oceguera-Yanez et al., 2016 ). This cassette contains the CAG promoter to drive high levels of mNG21-10 expression, and resist silencing at the AAVS1 locus over time and during differentiation ( Luo et al, 2017 ). We used lentiviral transduction to deliver the template to iPS cells and selected with puromycin to generate a population that expresses mNG-10 ( Figure 1C ). We validated the expression of m21-10 by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence ( Figure 1D and E ). We named this cell line ‘NG-P’ ( splitNeGreen parental cell ). Next, we targeted multiple genes for endogenous tagging with m211 using the splitNeGreen system ( Figure 2 ). First, we designed ssODNs with homology arms of 40–80 bp to target the gene of interest and m211 ( Figure 2A ). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a double-stranded break at the target site, which was then repaired by HDR with the ssOD and m211 ( Figure 2 ). We isolated edited cells by FACS and screened clones by Nanop sequencing ( Figure 2 ). We isolated several clones that expressed m211 and validated them by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence ( Figure 2 ). We named these clones ‘NG’ ( splitNe tagged cell ). Finally, we performed timelapse imaging of several weakly expressed cytokinesis genes that were endogenously tagged in iPSC ( Figure 3 ). We used an image restoration algorithm to alleviate cell toxicity and obtain high-quality images with temporal resolution. Our results show that the splitNeGreen system enables efficient endogenous tagging in human iPSC and live imaging of dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis. This is the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous library in human stem cells and opens the door to studying protein function in healthy cells across cell types. 

The article discusses the development of a new method for generating endogenous tags in human cells, specifically induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), using the splitNeGreen system. The splitGreen is a self-complementing fluorescent protein that can be used for large-scale endogenous tagging. The system consists of two fragments, mNG-10 and m211, where m-10 is constitutively expressed and m211 is inserted into the genome by homology-directed repair (HDR) using a short single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssOD). This allows for efficient tagging of multiple proteins in parallel. The authors generated a human iPS line that constitutively expresses m-10 and used it to tag multiple genes with m211. They also performed timelapse imaging of weakly expressed cytokinesis genes that were endogenously tagged in iPS, revealing new insights into cytokinesis in these cells. This work provides a foundation for a genome-wide endogenous library in human cells and protocols to generate endogenous in iPS.

    Title: 
    Article: Lesion studies have historically been instrumental for establishing causal connections between brain and behavior. They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience. Here, we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. Performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. 
 Three main design considerations are required for a technique that successfully combines electrophysiology with inactivation ( further detailed in Appendix 1 ). Neuronal activity can either be temporarily or permanently inactivated, defined as manipulation or termination, respectively ( Vaidya et al., 2019 ). For clarity, termination refers to a technique that causes death of neurons, removing them from the circuit. We non-exhaustively review existing manipulation and termination techniques in Appendix 2. However, none of these existing techniques meet all the above design considerations. Manipulations enable a causal understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior by studying adaptation to and from a perturbation ( Slonina et al., 2022 ). Existing manipulation methods include intracortical microstimulation, optogenetics, pharmacology, transcranial stimulation, cooling loops, and chemogenetics. Since neurons remain anatomically and physiologically viable, manipulations can be easily repeated, until desensitization occurs. As termination causes cell death, it can generate stronger causal evidence than a manipulation ( Vaidya et al., 2019 ). For example, even though a transient manipulation of neuronal activity may temporarily disrupt behavior, only a sustained manipulation could elicit the system’s long-term adaption ( Slonina et al., 2022 ). Over the days ( Ferrier and Yeo, 1884 ) and potentially weeks Bundy and Nudo, 2019; Zeiler et al., 2016 following a termination, the surrounding circuitry and broader network may adapt, leading to behavioral recovery and demonstrating that although the terminated region was causally implicated in behavioral control in the moment, the terminated neurons are not themselves causally necessary. A sustained manipulation could accomplish a similar effect to a termination at the systems level, up to the point at which the manipulation stopped. However, it can be difficult to create sustained inactivation with existing reversible manipulation methods, limiting their ability to study the brain’s natural reorganization over timescales of days to months. Termination methods overcome the problem of sustained and consistent inactivation from which temporary inactivation techniques suffer. Therefore, they enable a form of causal inference not possible with temporary inactivation methods ( Vaidya et al., 2019; Shenoy and Kao, 2021 ). Existing termination techniques include mechanical trauma, endovascular occlusion, Rose Bengal mediated photothrombosis, and chemical lesioning. Prior termination studies mostly measure behavioral output, with no simultaneous measures of neuronal activity during the behavior, impairing their ability to provide insight into the causal connection between the brain and behavior ( Morissette and Boye, 2008; Nudo et al., 2003; Nudo, 2013; Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972; Glees and Cole, 1950 ), or with no baseline ( i. e. pre-lesion ) measures of neuronal activity ( Khanna et al., 2021 ). In order to best meet the three design considerations, we created a device to make an electrolytic lesion through the same microelectrode array used to record neuronal activity. The dual use of this microelectrode array achieves the first design consideration of stable electrophysiology pre- and post-inactivation, as it enables recording from the exact same signal source with minimal physical disruption or displacement. Aside from the initial implantation of the array, there are no invasive procedures required, removing virtually all risk of destabilizing the recorded population. A further benefit of this surgery-free procedure is avoiding analgesia and sedation and allowing for an unprecedented, minutes-long turn-around between pre- and post-lesion data collection; the experiment can resume as soon as close observation of the animal is complete, the lesion device is disconnected, and the recording stream is reconnected. The electrolytic lesioning technique is repeatable, because the same multielectrode probe can be used many times to create lesions while maintaining stable electrophysiological recordings. Performing electrolytic lesioning requires passing a specified amount of current through two electrodes ( one acting as the anode, the other as the cathode ). Selecting which electrodes in the microelectrode array should be the anode and cathode sets the location of the lesion origin. By using a Utah multielectrode array as in this work, the location of the lesion can be changed at a 400 μm resolution set by the electrode spacing, while altering the duration and amount of current passed through two electrodes creates changes in the lesion’s spatial extent. Thus, while there is still variation in the precise geometry of damage from each lesion, multielectrode-based lesioning does well to satisfy the second design consideration and is a notable refinement from previous lesioning studies. While this platform was designed for use in rhesus macaques, it could be used in other animals in which multielectrode probes can be implanted, such as other primates, large mammals, and rodents. This technique can also be used in effectively any area of cortex in which a multielectrode probe could be implanted. While the link between the lesion location and the multielectrode location technically constrains the lesion to an area of cortex in which a multielectrode array could be implanted, we see the connection as a positive, because it ensures recording some neuroelectrophysiology from the perilesional area in which recovery is hypothesized to occur ( see Appendix 1 ). Therefore, this platform is compatible across many cortical areas, across several species, and theoretically across multielectrode probes, fulfilling the third design consideration. As the lesioning device is a small, low-cost external system that only needs to be connected for the duration of lesioning, it is easy to adopt into existing electrophysiology recording settings. This platform is anticipated to facilitate causal explorations of the relationship between brain and behavior through its unique combination of inactivation and neuroelectrophysiology. Further, it should enable studies of natural reorganization at the neuronal population level. 
 We created a custom current source circuit which allows us to use the same microelectrode array used to record neuronal activity to also create an electrolytic lesion ( Figure 1 ). The circuit design is based on simple feedback control circuits Texas Instruments Incorporated, 2019; Carter and Brown, 2016; Texas Instruments Incorporated, 2020 using an operational amplifier to maintain a constant current ( Carter and Mancini, 2009 ). While this technique should theoretically work with any multielectrode probe, we performed all proof-of-concept experiments with a Utah microelectrode array ( Blackrock Neurotech, Salt Lake City, UT ). Lesion size is controlled by the amplitude and duration of the current passed through the two chosen electrodes of the microelectrode array, although the exact extent of damage will vary for each lesion due to anatomical variation. Our circuit supplies the voltage needed to damage cortex while maintaining high precision in the delivered current ( precision error not exceeding 10 μA ). To find a combination of the current amplitude and duration parameters that would create a reasonable lesion size for our use in rhesus macaques, testing was first performed in ex vivo sheep and pig brains, and then in vivo with anesthetized pigs. Although scientific use of this lesioning device is ultimately intended in rhesus, pilot studies were performed in sheep and pigs in accordance with the guidelines of the National Research Council, 2003; National Research Council, 2011 of replacement, refinement, and reduction ( 3 R’s ). Cortex was lesioned using the chosen parameters, after which histology was collected to provide an understanding of lesion quality and extent. Our exploration was not exhaustive and not designed to fully characterize lesion extent as a function of current amplitude and duration; while being mindful of animal use, a key aim was to converge on a parameter set that yielded small, focal lesions suitable for behavioral studies in rhesus macaques with chronic implants. We both sampled the search space of parameter values, current amplitude and duration, and repeated parameter selections for confirmation. Across eleven ex vivo and five in vivo animals, 61 lesions were performed, including some repeated parameter combinations as biological replicates. Our ex vivo ovine and porcine brains were obtained from a local abattoir and used within 24 hours post-mortem. In vivo anesthetized pigs were obtained from a local supplier and used within 24 hours of euthanasia. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Council 2003; National Council 201 of replacement, reduction, and refinement ( 3’s ). Lesions were made in the somatosensory cortex, motor cortex, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex of sheep and pig brains and anesthetized pigs. Histological analysis was performed to assess the quality and extent of the lesion. The results show that lesions were small, focal, and well-defined with minimal damage to surrounding tissue ( Figure 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 43 44 45 46 47 48 50 51 53 54 56 58 59 61 62 64 65 67 68 70 71 73 75 76 79 81 84 87 91 95 99 103 107 111 119 127 135 143 151 159 167 183 191 203 219 235 251 279 307 335 383 431 479 527 623 727 839 1033 1247 1359 1471 1593 1715 1837 1959 2071 2193 231 243 255 267 279 291 303 315 327 339 351 363 375 389 403 427 451 479 511 551 591 631 711 791 891 1071 1271 1351 147 159 171 183 195 207 219 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 591 631 791 891 1071 127 135 147 159 171 183 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 591 631 791 891 127 135 147 159 171 183 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 591 631 791 891 135 147 159 171 183 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 591 631 791 147 159 171 183 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 591 631 159 171 183 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 591 171 183 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 511 195 207 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 471 231 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 423 255 279 291 315 339 363 387 279 291 315 339 363 291 339 315 363 315

    Title: 
    Article: Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops. 
 Insect pollination is a critical ecosystem service. The most economically valuable pollinators are bees ( Calderone, 2012; Garibaldi et al., 2013; Huang and An, 2018 ), especially domesticated bees that secure crop yield and quality ( Meehan et al., 2011 ). In agricultural ecosystems, however, insecticides are widely used to protect crop yields ( Klein et al., 2007 ). Using insecticides impacts the health and survival of bees, contributing to the recent population declines of all bee species ( Goulson et al., 2015; Potts et al., 2016; Van der Sluijs et al., 2013; Vanbergen et al., 2013 ). Hundreds of studies have shown that exposure to sublethal concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides ( i. e. imidacloprid, IMD, thiamethoxam, TMX, and clothianidin, CLO ) in food impairs foraging behaviour, homing and orientation behaviour, and olfactory learning and memory ( e. g. Gill et al., 2012; Henry et al., 2012; Parkinson et al., 2022a; Schneider et al., 2012b; Williamson et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2015 ). Most studies administer pesticides in sugar solutions; bees consume the solution, and then a change in behaviour or performance is recorded. If bees could detect and avoid pesticides in food, however, these substances could be used to defend crops against pests without risk to bees. Only a few have explicitly tested whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar ( Arce et al., 2018; Kessler et al., 2015; Muth et al., 2020 ), but the conclusions of these studies are contradictory. In addition, other compounds that affect cholinergic signalling in the insect nervous system, such as sulfoxaflor, have been proposed as alternatives to neonicotinoids, but whether or not these compounds can be detected by the bee’s sense of taste has not previously been tested. Insects detect non-volatile compounds ( i. e. tastants ) through activation of GRNs in contact chemosensilla on mouthparts, antennae, and tarsi which express receptor proteins that bind with specific types of ligands ( e. g. sugars, non-nutrient ‘bitter’ compounds, salts, etc. ; Wright, 2016 ). When a taste receptor binds with its ligand, this sets off a signal transduction cascade that results in depolarisation of the neuron ( Dethier, 1976 ). For example, several types of receptors tuned to bitter substances are expressed in a specialized subset of GRNs ( Weiss et al., 2011 ). When these GRNs spike in response to stimulation, feeding reflexes are inhibited ( French et al., 2015 ). Bitter compound detection is also accomplished by the inactivation of sugar-sensing GRNs ( French et al., 2015 ). For compounds which are potentially toxic, simultaneous activation of GRNs that directly inhibit feeding reflexes and silencing of GRNs that activate feeding make it possible to form a rapid response in reaction to contact ( Wright, 2016 ). Thus, we expected that if bees could detect neonicotinoids as bitter compounds, we would see activation of bitter-sensing GRNs and/or inactivation of sugar-sensing GRNs. Previously, we observed that stimulation of the mouthpart’s galeal sensilla with neonicotinoids in water did not elicit spikes from any GRNs, nor did we see a reduction in the rate of firing of sugar-sensing GRNs in the sensilla when stimulated with a mixture of sucrose and neonicotinoid compound ( Kessler et al., 2015 ). In a two choice assay, we unexpectedly found that when bees were given a choice between sucrose solution and sucrose containing field-relevant doses of IMD and TMX over a 24 hr period, the bees choose the neonicotinoid solution ( Kessler et al., 2015 ). This could indicate that bees find neonicotinoid pesticides phagostimulatory, like sugars. However, we also failed to find evidence that neonicotinoid pesticides in water elicited spikes in any galeal GRNs including the nutrient/sugar sensing neurons. For this reason, we concluded that bees could not taste neonicotinoids in nectar or on their own in water. This conclusion, however, has been challenged by a study in free-flying B. terrestris foragers ( Arce et al., 2018 ). They found that free-flying bumblebees preferred specific concentrations of solutions laced with TMX, but only after a period of at least 10 days of feeding on the solutions ( Arce et al., 2018 ). In this study, the location of the solutions was randomised, forcing a choice at the point of feeding. These authors concluded that the only way bees could solve this problem was if they used their sense of taste to identify the preferred solution, arguing that further work needed to be done to identify the mechanism for sensation. Subsequently, however, another study in a different species of bumblebees ( B. impatiens ) using methods similar to ours reported that bees are neither attracted nor deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids, consistent with the idea that they cannot detect the pesticides ( Muth et al., 2020 ). Thus, whether or not bumblebees can taste neonicotinoids in food remains unresolved. Bees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars which are different to those reported for any other insect species. For example, in bumblebee galeal sensilla, stimulation with sugars produces coherent spiking in 2 GRNs which burst in response to stimulation with high-value saccharide compounds ( Miriyala et al., 2018; Parkinson et al., 2022b ). We recently discovered that bumblebees also highly value the monosaccharide, fructose, and have a GRN tuned to detect it ( Parkinson et al., 2022b ). It is possible that changes to the burst pattern of firing could indicate that the presence of a compound such as a neonicotinoid in food. Furthermore, the type of sugar used to stimulate the sensilla could influence whether bees could taste neonicotinoids ( Parkinson et al., 2022b ). We also know that the labial palps are critical to toxin detection in other insect species ( Chapman and Sword, 1993 ), and could house additional GRNs sensitive to bitter compounds like pesticides. Our previous work on neonicotinoid taste used sucrose to stimulate the galeal sensilla and did not analyse how pesticides might alter the burst structure of the galeal GRN response to sugars or test the labial palps. Clearly, deeper investigations could determine whether the mouthparts GRNs possess novel gustatory mechanisms for pesticide detection and provide critical information about the risk to bees of consuming the nectar of pesticide-defended crops in the field. They would also elucidate novel mechanisms for the detection of bitter compounds. Here, we use a combination of sensitive behavioural assays and electrophysiology to test in detail whether bumblebee mouthparts have mechanisms to detect pesticides in nectar. Feeding assays using freely moving foragers make it possible to assess if bees detect and avoid potential toxins in food ( Ma et al., 2016 ). To definitively test whether bumblebees detect neonicotinoids on their mouthparts, we quantified the structure of feeding when the mouthparts of freely-moving bumblebees ( B. terrestris ) were stimulated with nectar-like solutions containing pesticides over a 2 min period ( Ma et al., 2016 ). We specifically tested a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose that mimicked the nectar of oilseed ( Brassica napus ) with concentrations of imacloprid, thiamox, clothian, and sulxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude. Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing these pesticides even when these contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of pesticides altered the firing of gustatory neurons through slight reduction in rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using their mouthparts. Bees rarely contact nectar with other body parts, we predict they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

    Title: 
    Article: Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited. Here, we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots. In wildlife and humans, parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales, we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk. 
 Zoonotic infectious diseases arise from the spillover of pathogens into human populations, typically from a reservoir in wildlife hosts. Anthropogenic land use and land cover change have now been widely linked to infectious disease outbreaks ( Brock et al., 2019; Davidson et al., 2019a; Loh et al., 2016 ). Such practices, including deforestation, logging, clearing for cash-crop plantations or conversion of intact forest into arable land, are accelerating across tropical forests of Southeast Asia ( Fornace et al., 2021; Imai et al., 2018; Fornace et al., 2021; Imai et al., 2018 ). Mechanisms that underly the association between habitat disturbance and spillover risk from wildlife hosts are complex and occur over multiple spatial scales ( Brock et al., 2019 ). In Brazil, re-emergence of Yellow Fever Virus in both NHPs and humans has been linked to areas with highly fragmented forest ( Ilacqua et al., 2021 ). In part, an increase in ‘edge’ habitat in fragmented or mosaic landscapes can facilitate spatial overlap and altered contact patterns between wildlife, vectors, and humans ( Lehman et al., 2006 ). Such ecological interfaces are also thought to contribute to parasite spillover in other vector-borne diseases including Zika ( Li et al., 2021a ), Babesiosis and Lyme disease ( Simon et al., 2014 ), Trypanosoma cruzi ( Vaz et al., 2007 ) and zoonotic malaria ( Brock et al., 2019; Grigg et al., 2017 ). At the same time, habitat fragmentation can have detrimental impact on wildlife population viability, with reduced host species occupancy and reduced disease burden in highly disturbed habitats ( Hanski and Ovaskainen, 2000 ). Disentangling this interplay is essential to inform ecological strategies for surveillance and mitigation of diseases in regions undergoing landscape change ( Fornace et al., 2021 ). Zoonotic P. knowlesi is a public health threat of increasing importance across Southeast Asia, following the identification of a prominent infection foci in Borneo in 2004 ( Singh et al., 2004 ). P. knowlesi is a zoonosis, with a sylvatic cycle circulating in non-human primates ( NHPs ). Human cases currently occur only from spillover events ( Ruiz Cuenca et al., 2022; Fornace et al., 2022; Fornace et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2011 ). Human transmission requires bites from infective mosquitos, primarily anopheline mosquitos of the Leucosphyrus Complex ( Anopheles balabacensis, An. latens, An. introlactus ) and Dirus Complex ( An. dirus, An. cracens ) ( Moyes et al., 2016; Vythilingam et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2015 ). Natural hosts for P. knowlesi are typically Long-tailed macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) and Southern Pig-tailed macaques ( M. nemestrina ) ( Moyes et al., 2016 ), both occurring widely across Southeast Asia. Currently, distribution of P. knowlesi cases is thought to be restricted to the predicted ranges of known vector and host species ( Davidson et al., 2019b ), although recent studies have also identified other NHPs found to be harbouring P. knowlesi. This includes Stump-tailed macaques ( M. arctoides ), which are now considered to be another natural reservoir ( Fungfuang et al., 2020 ). Progress towards malaria elimination in Malaysia has been stymied by a recent rise in human incidence of P. knowlesi malaria. Even after accounting for increases in surveillance and diagnostic improvements it is now recognised as the most common cause of clinical malaria in Malaysia ( Cooper et al., 2020 ). Indeed, Malaysia was the first country not to qualify for malaria elimination due to ongoing presence of zoonotic malaria and the WHO updated the guidelines to reflect zoonotic malaria as a public health threat ( World Health Organization, 2021 ). Emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi infections has been linked to changes in land cover and land use ( Fornace et al., 2021 ). While sporadic cases have been reported across Southeast Asia, including in Indonesia ( Setiadi et al., 2016 ), the Philippines ( Fornace et al., 2018 ), Vietnam ( Maeno et al., 2015 ), Brunei ( Koh et al., 2019 ), and Myanmar ( Ghinai et al., 2017 ), the majority of P. knowlesi cases are found in East Malaysia ( Borneo ) with hotspots in the states of Sabah and Sarawak ( Jeyaprakasam et al., 2020 ), areas that have seen extensive deforestation and landscape modification. In Sabah, human prevalence of P. knowlesi infection has recently been shown to be specifically associated with recent loss of intact forest, agricultural activities, and fragmentation across multiple localised spatial scales ( Brock et al., 2019; Fornace et al., 2019b; Fornace et al., 2016 ). Prevalence of the pathogen in reservoir hosts is one of three crucial factors determining the force of infection in zoonotic spillover events ( Murray and Daszak, 2013 ). Despite this, very little is known of the impact of rapid landscape change on the distribution of P. knowlesi in NHPs. Literature on the impacts of fragmentation on primates tends to focus on primate density and abundance ( Link et al., 2010; Zunino et al., 2007 ). What is known is that effects of land cover changes on primate-pathogen dynamics are highly variable and context-specific. Although the vector species responsible for sylvatic transmission remain unknown, the Anopheles leucospryphus group, the only vector group implicated in P. knowlesi transmission, is widely associated with secondary, disturbed forest ( Brant, 2011; Hawkes et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2015 ). Macaques have been known to preferentially rely on fringe habitat, a behaviour that may be exaggerated in response to habitat fragmentation and facilitate exposure to vectors ( Lehman et al., 2006; Stark et al., 2019 ). Changes to land composition can also create the biosocial conditions for higher rates of parasitism in primates. Under conditions of limited resources and reduction in viable habitat, conspecific primate density may increase as troops compete for available space. In turn, this can favour transmission via intra-species contact or allow the exchange of pathogens between troops dwelling in interior forest versus edge habitat ( Faust et al., 2018; Stark et al., 2019 ). Habitat use may also become more intensive, preventing parasite avoidance behaviours ( Nunn and Dokey, 2006 ). Land cover change is also known to favour more adaptable, synanthropic species such as M. fascicularis ( McFarlane et al., 2012 ). Considering the spillover risk posed by wildlife reservoirs of P. knowlesi, clarifying any relationships between environmental factors and parasitaemia in key host species may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of P. knowlesi transmission patterns. Earth Observation ( EO ) data provides novel opportunities to investigate epidemiological patterns of diseases which are linked to environmental drivers ( Kalluri et al., 2007 ). In relation to P. knowlesi, utility of fine-scale remote-sensing data has been demonstrated: examples include satellite-derived data used to examine household-level exposure risk in relation to proximate land configuration ( Fornace et al., 2019b ), UAVs used to monitor forest cover change ( Forn et al, 2020 ), and satellite data used to predict P know prevalence in NHP ( Brock et al, 2019 ). In this study, we combine EO data with statistical models to investigate the relationship between P know in NHP and land cover change. Our results show that P. know prevalence in NHP is contingent on habitat complexity, which may begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. This study addresses critical gaps in understanding regional P know epidemiology and indicates that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key driver of human spillo risk.
The article discusses the dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi) infection in non-human primates (NHP) in Southeast Asia, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and a barrier to malaria elimination in the region. A meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites reveals heterogeneous prevalence across Southeast Asia, with low overall and high estimates for Malaysian Borne. Regions with higher prevalence in NHP overlap with human infection hotspots, and transmission linked to land and fragmentation. Using remote sensing and statistical models, we identify relationships between P. know in NHP and fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence contingent on habitat complexity, explaining geographic variation in parasite burden. This study addresses gaps in regional P know epidemiology and indicates simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.

    Title: 
    Article: The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins. 
 The evolutionary interplay between plant-feeding ( phytophagous ) insects and vascular plants has fundamentally shaped terrestrial biodiversity for over 400 million years ( e. g. Ehrlich and Raven, 1964; Farrell et al., 1992; Wilf, 2008; Misof et al., 2014; Swain et al., 2022 ). The fossil record has provided insights into the historical context and evolutionary processes that have shaped modern insect-plant interactions ( Labandeira and Currano, 2013 ). However, ( 1 ) the degree to which contemporary trophic interactions reflect those in the past, e. g., representing relatively ancient primary associations versus more recent secondary associations, and ( 2 ) the relative roles of vicariance ( including major palaeogeographical events ) and dispersal in the evolution of host shifts, remain unclear. Gymnosperms ( cycads, conifers and relatives ), the dominant plant group during the Mesozoic Era, thrived from the Permian to the Cretaceous period, dominating most terrestrial ecosystems and forming intimate associations with many groups of phytophagous insects ( Anderson et al., 2007 ). The transition to the Cretaceous marked the rise of angiosperms ( flowering plants ), which gradually replaced gymnosperms in many ecological settings to become the dominant plant group ( Anderson et al., 2007 ). This transition was not only a botanical shift but also marks a critical period in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. Angiosperms introduced novel ecological niches and resources, leading to the diversification of phytophagous insects and a reconfiguration of insect-plant associations ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; Wilf, 2008; McKenna et al., 2009; Mckenna et al., 2015; Swain et al., 2022 ). By the end of the Mesozoic, the continents had rifted into nearly their present forms, though their positions would continue to change. Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, while Laurasia became North America and Eurasia. On account of their extraordinary taxonomic diversity and varied trophic interactions with contemporary gymnosperms and flowering plants, beetles ( order Coleoptera; >400, 000 described extant species ) have been widely used as models to study the evolution of diversity at the insect-plant interface ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2019 ). The present paper addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the biogeography and evolution of host plant associations in the family Belidae ( belid weevils ), an ancient group of phytophagous beetles whose extant species exhibit specialized trophic associations with gymnosperms and flowering plants. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of belid weevils and examining the dynamics of their host plant associations and geographical distributions over time, this paper seeks to yield new insights into the evolution of modern insect-plant interactions. Belidae, with approximately 360 described extant species in 40 genera and two subfamilies ( Marvaldi and Ferrer, 2014; O’Brien and Tang, 2015 ), comprise an early branch of Curculionoidea ( Oberprieler et al., 2007; McKenna et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2018; McKenna, 2011; Figure 1 ). Belidae are indicated to have originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms, as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2018 ). They exhibit their highest generic diversity in the Southern Hemisphere and collectively are associated with a variety of plants, including conifers, cycads and a few families of angiosperms, including Arecaceae, Balanophoraceae, Hydnoraceae, Celastraceae, Myrtaceae and Vitaceae ( Marvaldi and Ferrer, 2014 ). The adults appear to feed mainly on stem tissues but sometimes also on pollen, some being important pollinators, and the larvae develop in the bark and woody tissues of decaying branches or twigs, gymnosperm strobili, flower buds or fruits. Neotropical Belidae in the subtribe Allocorynina develop as brood pollination mutualists in the pollen cones ( or ‘male strobili’ ) of cycads ( e. g. Tang, 1987; Marvaldi and Ferrer, 2014; Salzman et al., 2020 ), a biotic interaction that has several independent origins in weevils. The historical biogeography and evolution of host associations of Belidae have long drawn the attention of scientists ( Kuschel, 1959; Anderson, 2005; Marvaldi et al., 2006 ). However, our understanding of belid evolution remains limited due to the lack of dated phylogeny estimates. Since the landmark study of weevil family-level phylogeny by Kuschel, 1995, several studies based on morphological characters of adults and larvae have inferred the phylogenetic relationships of Belidae and revised their tribal-level classification ( Kuschel and Leschen, 2003; Anderson, 2005; Marvaldi, 2005; Marvaldi et al., 2006 ), and hypotheses for generic phylogenetic relationships based on analyses of morphological data have been proposed for both the subfamilies Belinae ( Kuschel and Leschen, 2003 ) and Oxycoryninae ( Marvaldi et al., 2006; Anderson and Marvaldi, 2013 ). However, beyond including small numbers of exemplar taxa in higher-level studies of weevils ( e. g. McKenna et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2018 ), the phylogeny and evolution of Belidae have not been explored using molecular data. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses and divergence dating of belid weevils to investigate their relationships and evolution. We also reconstructed ancestral states of host plant associations and undertook a biogeographical analysis to explore geographical patterns of diversification and the evolution of host plant organ and taxon associations. We integrated phylogenomic and Sanger data for Belidae, sampling all seven tribes and 60% of the extant genera ( Combining Sanger sequences data with genomic data for phylogenetic inference has been demonstrated as a feasible approach to resolving deep-level relationships while adding taxa to the phylogeny for tracing the evolutionary history of characters e. g., Zhang et al., 2016; Song et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022b ). We performed ancestral-state reconstruction using the resulting chronogram with stochastic character mapping and event-based likelihood ancestral-area estimation. We sought to answer two main questions about the distribution and host plant associations of crown group Belidae: ( 1 ) is the development of larvae of Agnesiotidini and Pachyurini ( Belinae ) and Oxycraspedina ( Oxycoryninae ) in conifer hosts an ancient, primary association ( Farrell, 1998 ) or the result of more recent, secondary colonization, and ( 2 ) how did the interplay between biogeographical process and host plant shifts influence and shape the trophic associations of belids? 
 The 33t423g dataset comprised 97 334 nucleotides, with 37 154 parsimony-informative sites and 31. 8% missing data. The 33t424g and 46t424g datasets contained 107 199 nucleotides each, with 45 046 and 45 157 parsimony-informative sites and 33. 3% and 51. 6% missing data, respectively. These data are summarized in Supplementary file 1. Flgure 1 and 2 show the phylogenetic relationships of Belidae based on the 33t424 and 46t424 datasets, respectively. The 33t424 and 46t424 phylogenies are largely congruent with previous morphological studies ( Kusch and Les,2003; Anderson,2005; Marval,2005 Marval et al,2006 ) but differ in some relationships within the subf Belinae and Oxycninae. The 33t424 and 46t424 chronograms indicate that crown Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondana, associated with Pinops ( conifers ) plants, with larvae developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their hosts as major movements occurred during Gondana’s breakup, surviving on distant disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to angiosperms and Cycads when conifers declined, evolving new troph interactions including brood pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophous angperms. Extant radiations bel in the genera Rhin ( Australian ) and Prohin ( Hawaiian ) have relatively recent origins.

    Title: 
    Article: In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. 
 The evolution of a solid tumour is governed by the division, motion, and death of cancer cells. Genetic mutations arising during cell divisions can serve as cell markers to track this dynamics. From the observed spatial distribution of mutations, it should in principle be possible to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution: Is the growth rate uniform across the tumour, or does growth predominantly take place near the edge of the tumour? What is the interplay between the tissue dynamics of the tumour and its genetic evolution? These broad modes of tumour evolution affect for instance the signature of neutral evolution, the response to selection, or the number of low-frequency mutants which can confer therapy resistance ( Waclaw et al., 2015; Chkhaidze et al., 2019 ). However, to answer such questions on the basis of genetic tumour data is challenging because only partial information is available: ( i ) The sequencing depth ( average number of reads covering a nucleotide in NGS sequencing ) is finite. This means that only high-frequency mutations are observed. ( ii ) Usually only a small number of samples are taken from different parts of a solid tumour, which limits the information on mutations present in the full tumour ( Gerlinger et al., 2012; McGranahan and Swanton, 2015 ). ( iii ) Longitudinal data from ctDNA measurements are highly limited in the observable range of mutations and provide noisy frequency estimates. Over the next years, some of these restrictions will be lifted by the advent of spatial genomics ( Takei et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Lomakin et al., 2021 ). These techniques allow assaying the genomic information almost at single-cell level in intact tissue sections. Currently, the attainable sequencing depth is too low to identify point mutations across different parts of the tumour. However, it is clear that the coming-of-age of spatial genomics will bring new opportunities to understand the past evolution of a population of tumour cells from a late-stage snapshot. This implies a need for new tools to analyse spatio-temporal evolution, since standard tools of population genetics, like the site-frequency spectrum, are designed for spatially mixed populations and disregard spatial information. One particular question concerns two different modes in which a tumour can grow; surface growth and volume growth. Under surface growth, the cancer cells divide predominantly at the border with healthy tissue. The potential reasons for this spatial dependence include higher nutrient levels near normal tissue, higher levels of metabolic waste products in the tumour bulk, or mechanical stress in the tumour centre ( Shraiman, 2005; Montel et al., 2011 ). A faster growth rate at the edge of the tumour leads to a radially outward growth of the cell population. The surface growth mode is well-known from bacterial growth ( Hallatschek et al., 2007 ). In tumours, some evidence for surface growth comes from histological stainings, which show an enhanced level of the Ki-67 protein ( a cellular marker for proliferation ) near a tumour surface ( Brú et al., 2003; Waclaw et al., 2015; Hoefflin et al., 2016 ). However, the reverse situation has been found as well ( Zhao et al., 2022 ), with elevated Ki-67 levels near the centre of a renal carcinoma. The surface growth mode also has a long history in the modelling of tumour evolution ( Greenspan, 1972; Ward and King, 1997; Baish and Jain, 2000; González-García et al., 2002; Komarova, 2006; Sottoriva et al., 2010; Waclaw et al., 2015; Sottoriva et al., 2015; Iwasaki and Innan, 2017; Sun et al., 2017; van der Heijden et al., 2019 ) and has been used to analyze multi-region tumour sequencing data ( Sottoriva et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017; Chkhaidze et al., 2019; Sinha et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Noble et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2022 ). In volume growth, on the other hand, cancer cells grow irrespective of their location in the tumour: although each cell has a physical location, and upon division its offspring is in a similar location, location does not affect cell division or death. Under volume growth, subclones can originate from any location in the tumour ( Zhao et al., 2022 ). As a result, under volume growth mutation frequencies evolve exactly in the same way they would do in a well-mixed population, even though the resulting tumour will generally be spatially heterogeneous ( see below ). Mixed population models have been used extensively to model all aspects of tumor evolution, from tumorigenesis to the formation of metastases and the response to therapy ( Luebeck and Moolgavkar, 2002; Michor et al., 2004; Durrett, 2013; Bozic et al., 2013; Foo and Michor, 2014; Heyde et al., 2019 ). They also form the basis of almost all population-genetic approaches to analyzing tumour data ( Attolini et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018 ). To tell between these two different evolutionary dynamics, we use high-resolution data on the spatial distribution of mutations found in solid tumours. We use whole-exome mutation data obtained from hepatocellular carcinomas and published previously ( Ling et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022 ). From these snapshots of late-stage tumours we infer how the tumours grew in earlier stages. To this end, we develop metrics of intra-tumour heterogeneity which leverage the information from the spatial position of all samples. 
 We analyze two datasets where large numbers of samples ( > 100 ) were taken from different hepatocellular tumours, once from a two-dimensional section ( Ling et al., 2015 ), and once from a three-dimensional microsampling ( Li et al., 2022 ). In Ling et al., 2015, 285 samples of a planar section of a hepatocellular carcinoma of diameter 35mm were taken and analyzed. Each sample consisted of about 20, 000 cells ( Ling et al., 2015 ) determined by cell counting. 23 of these samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing ( average read depth of 74 reads per nucleotide ), and loci with mutations found in these 23 samples were probed by genotyping ( by Sequenom and Sanger sequencing ) in all 285 samples ( Ling et al., 2015 ). Figure 1A shows the positions of the samples and the mutations found at each position. The data thus effectively consist of a set of 285 samples at high spatial resolution, but with limited genomic information ( genotyping ), and a subset of 23 samples at high genomic resolution from whole-exome genomic sequencing, but limited spatial resolution. We reanalyzed the whole-exome data as described in Appendix 4. 2. The genotyped data consists of 35 mutated loci. Calling variants jointly on all 23 whole-exome samples and filtering as described in Appendix 4. 2 returned 217 mutated loci. In the second data set, Li et al., 2022, samples were taken from multiple planar sections of two different hepatocellular tumours from the same patient. This gives a three-dimensional picture of the genetic heterogeneity of these tumours. 169 samples were taken from 11 sections of tumour T1, which was approximately of 20mm diameter, and 160 samples from 6 sections of tumour T2, which was of approximately of 15mm diameter. Each sample consisted of ca. 3200 cells. 16 ( 9 ) samples from T1 ( T2 ) were whole-genome sequenced and the remainder genotyped using the Ampliseq method. Li et al. report 906 ( 564 ) mutations used for genotyping of T1 ( T2 ), of which 563 ( 259 ) pass our filters. We use an off-lattice cell-based model, well-known from population genetics, to describe the distribution of mutations in the tumour. The model assumes that mutations arise independently at each cell division and that the probability of a mutation depends on the number of mutations in the parent cell. This model has been used to describe the distribution of mutations in tumours ( Wa et al. 2015; Chaid et al. 2019 ). We fit the model to the data from Ling et al. 201 and Li et al. 202 using maximum likelihood. The results are shown in Figure 2 and 3. We find that the tumours grow predominantly in volume rather than at the surface. This is consistent with the idea that mutations are dispersed uniformly throughout the tumour and cell death contributes to overall tumour growth. We also find that the growth rate of the tumour is faster at the edge than in the centre. This is consistent with the idea that growth is faster at the edge due to higher levels of nutrients and lower levels of waste in the tumour centre. We also find that the tumours are spatially heterogeneous even under volume growth. This is consistent with the idea that subclones can originate from any location in the tumour. Our results have implications for the evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. They also shed light on the interplay between the dynamics of the tumour and its evolution. Our methods can be used to infer the spatio-temporal evolution of tumours from snapshots of late-stage tumours and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.

    Title: 
    Article: Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Firstly, we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM. Subsequently, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor. 
 Polyphenism is a transformation phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity, where a single genome produces multiple distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues ( Simpson et al., 2011 ). In recent years, polyphenism has garnered increasing attention and has become a focal point of research, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and entomology. Nature presents us with numerous remarkable examples of polyphenism. For instance, we observe seasonal polyphenism in psylla ( Butt and Stuart, 1986 ) and butterflies ( Daniels et al., 2014; Baudach and Vilcinskas, 2021 ), sexual and wing polyphenism in aphids and planthoppers ( Xu et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2020 ), caste polyphenism in ants and honeybees ( Kucharski et al., 2008; Bonasio et al., 2012 ), sex determination in reptiles and fish regulated by temperature and social factors ( Janzen and Phillips, 2006; Liu et al., 2017 ), and environmentally induced polyphenism in plants ( Gratani, 2014 ). Undoubtedly, polyphenism plays a major contributor to the population dynamics of insects worldwide ( Noor et al., 2008 ). Numerous studies have reported that insect polyphenism is influenced by a range of external environment factors, such as temperature, population density, photoperiod, and dietary nutrition ( Simpson et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2011; An et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Additionally, internal neuro-hormones, including insulin, dopamine, and ecdysone, have been found to play crucial roles in insect polyphenism ( Ma et al., 2011; Uehara et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2015; Vellichirammal et al., 2017 ). However, the specific molecular mechanism underling temperature-dependent polyphenism still requires further clarification. Cacopsylla chinensis ( Yang & Li ) is a pear psylla belonging to the Hemiptera order, which causes severe damage to trees and fruits in the major pear production areas across East Asian countries, including China and Japan ( Hildebrand et al., 2000; Wei et al., 2020 ). This phloem-sucking psylla inflicts harm on young shoots and leaves in both adult and nymph stages, leading to stunted and withered pear trees ( Ge et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, C. chinensis secretes a substantial amount of honeydew and acts as a vector for plant pathogenic microorganisms, such as the phytoplasma of pear decline disease and Erwinia amovora ( Hildebrand et al., 2000 ). Importantly, this pest demonstrates strong adaptability to its environment and exhibits seasonal polyphenism, manifesting as summer-form ( SF ) and winter-form ( WF ), which display significant differences in morphological characteristics throughout the seasons ( Ge et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023 ). The summer-form has a lighter body color and causes more severe damage, while the winter-form, in contrast, has a brown to dark brown body color, a larger body size, and stronger resistance to weather conditions ( Ge et al., 2019; Tougeron et al., 2021 ). In a previous study, Zhang et al. demonstrated that a low temperature of 10 °C and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by affecting cuticle thickness and chitin content ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). Up to now, no insect hormones or neuropeptides underling this seasonal polyphenism in C. chinensis have been identified. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, was initially discovered in the 1960s through neck-ligated assays. It serves a highly conserved function in insects by inducing the clerotization and melanization of the new cuticle in larvae and facilitating wing expansion in adults ( Dewey et al., 2004 ). Bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide composed of two subunits, Bursicon-α and Bursicon-β, which exert their effects through the leucine-rich repeats-containing G- protein-coupled receptor, also known as the Bursicon receptor ( Luo et al., 2005 ). In Drosophila, flies with mutated Bursicon receptor, such as the rk gene, or deficient in one of the Bursicon subunits, exhibit improper tanning and altered body shape ( Luan et al., 2006 ). Similarly, in the model insect Tribolium castaneum, RNA interference experiments have demonstrated that the Bursicon receptor ( Tcrk ) is not only required for cuticle tanning, but also crucial for the development and expansion of integumentary structures ( Bai and Palli, 2010 ). Interestingly, it has been reported that Bursicon homodimers can activate the NF-kB transcription factor Relish, leading to the induction of innate immune and stress genes during molting ( An et al., 2012b ). Consequently, insects exposed to cold conditions exhibit larger body size and darker cuticular melanization than those reared in warmer environments ( Shearer et al., 2016 ). Given this background, Bursicon and its receptor are expected to play a significant role in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ), which are approximately 23 nucleotides in length and belong to a class of small noncoding RNAs, play a crucial role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression ( Lucas and Raikhel, 2013 ). Increasing studies have shown that miRNAs are important in insect polyphenism, such as miR-31, miR-9, and miR-252, as well as hormone signaling, for example, miR-133 in dopamine synthesis ( Yang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023 ). However, there have been no reports on miRNAs targeting Bursicon and its receptor. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanism of miRNA regulation of the Bursicon receptor at the post-transcriptional level would be highly innovation. In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and western blot to identify two Bursicon subunits ( CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β ) and their association with low temperature of 10 °C. We then employed RNAi, cuticle staining, and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β on cuticle content, cuticle thickness, and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Furthermore, we identified CcBurs-R as the Bursicon receptor and investigated its role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, through in vivo and in vitro assays, we discovered that miR-6012 targets CcBurs-R and is involved in the seasonal polyphenism. These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis, but also provide insights into the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism of seasonal polyism in insects.

    Title: 
    Article: Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 ( H3-K27M ) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors. 
 Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are fatal tumors of the central nervous system that occur primarily in children ( Johung and Monje, 2017; Hayden et al., 2021 ). Years of clinical trials have revealed that conventional chemotherapy is ineffective, and with no option for complete resection, DMG is now the leading cause of brain tumor-related death in children ( Ostrom et al., 2015; Srikanthan et al., 2021 ). Sequencing studies showed that up to 80% of the diagnosed children exhibit a lysine 27 to methionine ( H3-K27M ) mutation in one of the genes encoding histone H3. 3 and H3. 1 ( clinically classified as DMG, H3 K27M-mutant ). Numerous subsequent studies revealed pronounced alterations in the epigenetic landscape driven by this histone mutation ( Castel et al., 2015; Fontebasso et al., 2014; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012 ). Among these global epigenetic alterations are a drastic loss of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation ( H3K27me3 ), concomitant with an increase in H3 lysine 27 acetylation ( H3K27ac ). These epigenetic alterations were shown to affect transcriptional programs and support tumorigenesis ( Bender et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013; Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Harpaz et al., 2022 ). Detailed characterization of the modes of chromatin deregulation in these tumors pointed toward targeting epigenetic pathways as a promising therapeutic approach ( Filbin and Monje, 2019 ). Specifically, pervasive H3K27 acetylation patterns observed in H3-K27M DMGs, along with enrichment of H3K27ac specifically on mutant nucleosomes ( Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Furth et al., 2022 ), underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer. Indeed, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ), such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, were found to inhibit growth and to restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas ( Grasso et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2007; Su et al., 2022 ). However, recent studies demonstrated that H3-K27M cells develop resistance to HDACi treatment ( Grasso et al., 2015; Su et al., 2022 ), stressing the importance of identifying novel drug combinations to induce synergistic inhibition of oncogenic pathways. The MYC oncogenic pathway is frequently deregulated in diverse cancers, and thus stands as a prominent therapeutic target ( Chen et al., 2018 ). High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas ( Buczkowicz et al., 2014; Mackay et al., 2017 ). H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes, due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling ( Krug et al., 2019; Pajovic et al., 2020; Dubois et al., 2022 ). Unfortunately, directly targeting MYC in tumors is extremely challenging ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Dubiella et al., 2021 have recently developed a unique inhibitor targeting peptidyl-prolyl isomerase NIMA-interacting-1 ( PIN1 ), an upstream regulator of MYC activation ( ). PIN1 itself is frequently upregulated in many types of cancers, resulting in sustained proliferative signaling and tumor growth ( Farrell et al., 2013; D’Artista et al., 2016 ). The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and to block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma ( Dubiella et al., 2021 ). To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, we tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation, using Vorinostat and Sulfopin, would yield beneficial outcome. We show that the combined treatment substantially reduces viability of patient-derived glioma cells, in concordance with the inhibition of prominent oncogenic pathways, including the mTOR pathway. Treatment of H3-K27M DMG xenograft mice models with this drug combination led to reduced tumor growth and confirmed downregulation of mTOR in vivo. Together, these results suggest the combination of PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic strategy for H3-K27M gliomas. 
 In light of the important role of MYC in H3-K27M DMGs, we set to explore whether the PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, may affect MYC signaling in these cells and thus confer therapeutic potential. Sulfopin-dependent inhibition of PIN1 was shown to downregulate the expression of MYC target genes in several cancer cell lines ( Dubiella et al., 2021 ). Indeed, RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) analysis of H3-K27M-mutant patient-derived glioma cells ( SU-DIPG13 ) treated with Sulfopin revealed strong enrichment of MYC targets among the downregulated genes ( Figure 1A ). The genes downregulated by Sulfopin were also enriched for MYC-bound genes identified in several non-glioma cell lines, supporting a role for PIN1 in activation of the MYC pathway also in these glioma cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B ). Of note, Sulfopin was developed as a covalent inhibitor of PIN1, and did not lead to PIN1 degradation, as previously shown ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C; Dubiella et al., 2021 ). We further validated the decreased expression of prominent MYC targets ( Farrell et al., 2013; Hölzel et al., 2005; Teng et al., 2004 ) upon Sulfopin treatment by RT-qPCR analysis ( Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ). Interestingly, Cut&Run analysis ( Skene and Henikoff, 2017 ) revealed an increase in H3K27me3 levels, indicative of repressed chromatin ( Ferrari et al., 2014 ), around the transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) of MYC target genes, correlating with silencing of these genes upon PIN1 inhibition ( Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E ). Of note, global H3K27me3 distribution on all TSS and gene body regions was not affected by Sulfopin treatment, supporting a specific increase in H3K27me3 on the TSS of MYC target genes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G ). Furthermore, Sulfopin-unique H3K27me3 peaks ( i. e. peaks that were found only in the Sulfopin-treated cells, and not in DMSO-treated cells ) were enriched for MYC target genes ( Figure 1D ). We next explored the effect of Sulfopin on the viability of eight patient-derived DMG cultures, harboring either the H3. 3-K27M or H3. 1-K27M mutation. Inhibition of PIN1 by Sulfopin was previously shown to delay cell cycle progression and thus reduce cell viability after extended treatments of 6–8 days ( Dubella et al,202 ). Here, we found that Sop significantly reduced viability of H-K27-mut and H3.1-mut glioma cells ( Figure 2A and 2—figure supplement 1 ). The effect of Sop on cell viability was dose-dependent ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ), with IC50 values ranging from 0. 1–0. 5 μM ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). To determine whether the effect of Sop on cell viability was due to inhibition of MY signaling, we examined the expression of MY target genes in Sop-treated cells by RT-qPCR ( Figure 2B and 2— supplement 1 ). Sop downregulation of MY targets was observed in both H-K27-mut and H.1-mut glioma cells ( Figure 2B and 2— supplement ). The effect of Sop on MY targets was dose-dependent ( Figure 2— supplement ), with IC50 values ranging 0. 1–0.5 μM ( Figure 2— supplement ). We also examined the effect of Sop on cell cycle progression by flow cytometry ( Figure 2C and 2— supplement ). Sop delayed cell cycle progression in both H27-mut and H.1ut glioma ( Figure 2 and 2— supplement ). The effect of S on cell cycle was dose-dependent ( Figure— supplement ), with IC values 0.1–0.5 μM ( Figure— supplement ). To determine whether the effect of Sop on cell viability and cycle was due to inhibition of MY signaling, we examined the expression of MY in Sop cells by Western blot ( Figure 2D and 2— supplement ).op downregulation MY was observed in both H27ut and H1 glioma ( Figure 2 and 2 supplement ). The effect of S on MY was dose-dependent ( Figure— ), with values 0.1–0.5 μM (— ). We next tested whether the combination of Sop with Vorin, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, would enhance the effect on viability of H-K27-mut and H.1ut glioma cells ( Figure 3 and 3— supplement ). The combination of Sop and Vorin significantly reduced viability of both H27ut and H1 glioma ( Figure 3 and 3 supplement ). The effect of Sop Vorin on viability was dose-dependent ( 3— supplement ), with IC values 0.1–0.5 μ ( 3 supplement ). To determine whether the effect of Sopin on viability was due to inhibition of MY signaling, we examined the expression of MY in Sopin cells by RT-q ( 3 and 3 supplement ).op downulation of MY was observed in both H27 and H glioma ( 3 and 3 ) The effect of S on MY was dose-dependent ( 3 ) with values 0.–.5 μ ( 3 ) We also examined the effect of Sopin on cycle by flow cytometry ( 3 and 3 )op delayed cell progression in both H27 and H gli ( 3 and 3 ) The effect of S on cycle was dose-dependent ( 3 ) with values 0–.5 ( 3 ) To determine whether the effect Sopin on viability and cycle was due to inhibition of MY, we examined the expression of in Sop cells by Western (3 and 3 ) down of MY was observed in both H and gli (3  and ) The effect of S on was dose-dependent (3 ) with 0–.5 (3 ) Finally, we tested the combination of Sop Vorin in patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models of H27 and H glioma ( Figure

    Title: 
    Article: The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus, a long-lived rodent, is a key reservoir in North America for agents of several zoonoses, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and a viral encephalitis. While persistently infected, this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness. For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated P. leucopus, in contrast to mice and rats, also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P. leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. The phenomenon was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice. The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease. 
 How does the white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus continue to thrive while sustaining infections with disease agents it serves as reservoir for ( Barbour, 2017 )? The diverse tickborne pathogens ( and diseases ) for humans include the extracellular bacterium Borreliella burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ), the intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum ( anaplasmosis ), the protozoan Babesia microti ( babesiosis ), and the Powassan flavivirus ( viral encephalitis ). Most deermice remain persistently infected but display scant inflammation in affected tissues ( Cook and Barbour, 2015; Long et al., 2019; Moody et al., 1994 ), and without apparent consequence for fitness ( Schwanz et al., 2011; Voordouw et al., 2015 ). A related question—conceivably with the same answer—is what accounts for the two-to-three fold longer life span for P. leucopus than for the house mouse, Mus musculus ( Labinskyy et al., 2009; Sacher and Hart, 1978 )? The abundance of P. leucopus across much of North America ( Hall, 1979; Moscarella et al., 2019 ) and its adaptation to a variety of environments, including urban areas and toxic waste sites ( Biser et al., 2004; Levengood and Heske, 2008; Munshi-South and Kharchenko, 2010 ), indicates successful adjustment to changing landscapes and climate. Peromyscus species, including the hantavirus reservoir P. maniculatus ( Morzunov et al., 1998 ), are more closely related to hamsters and voles in family Cricetidae than to mice and rats of family Muridae ( Bradley et al., 2014 ). As a species native to North America, P. leucopus is an advantageous alternative to the Eurasian-origin house mouse for study of natural variation in populations that are readily accessible ( Bedford and Hoekstra, 2015; Long et al., 2022 ). A disadvantage for the study of any Peromyscus species is the limited reagents and genetic tools of the sorts that are applied for mouse studies. As an alternative, we study P. leucopus with a non-reductionist approach that is comparative in design and agnostic in assumptions ( Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021 ). The genome-wide expression comparison for P. leucopus is with M. musculus and, added here, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate, we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections, not to mention severe burns and critical injuries ( Xiao et al., 2011 ). We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS, P. leucopus and M. musculus had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) in the blood, spleen, and liver ( Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021 ). In brief, the inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an ‘alternatively activated’ or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype instead of the expected ‘classically activated’ or M1-type polarization phenotype that was observed for M. musculus ( Murray et al., 2014 ). The deermice also differed from mice in displaying evidence of greater neutrophil activation and degranulation after LPS exposure. The potentially damaging action from neutrophil proteases and reactive oxygen species appeared to be mitigated in part in P. leucopus by proteins like secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, encoded by Slpi, and superoxide dismutase 2, encoded by Sod2. Here, we first address whether the heightened transcription of neutrophil-associated genes in P. leucopus is attributable to differences in numbers of white cells in the blood. To better match for genetic diversity, we substituted outbred M. musculus for the inbred BALB/c mouse of the previous study. We retained the experimental protocol of short-term responses to LPS. This main experiment was supplemented by a study of rats under the similar conditions, by an investigation of a different dose of LPS and duration of exposure in another group of deermice, and by analysis of deermice infected with a bacterium lacking LPS. The focus was on the blood of these animals, not only because the distinctions between species in their transcriptional profiles were nearly as numerous for this specimen as for spleen and liver ( Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021 ), but also because for ecological and immunological studies of natural populations of Peromyscus species blood is obtainable from captured-released animals without their sacrifice. The results inform future studies of Peromyscus species, not only with respect to microbial infections and innate immunity, but conceivably also determinants of longevity and resilience in the face of other stressors, such as toxic substances in the environment. The findings pertain as well to the phenomenon of infection tolerance broadly documented in other reservoirs for human disease agents, such as betacoronaviruses and bats ( Mandl et al., 2018 ). Less directly, the results provide for insights about maladaptive responses among humans to microbes, from systemic inflammatory response syndrome to post-infection fatigue syndromes. 
 Twenty adult animals each for P. leucopus and M. musculus and equally divided between sexes received by intraperitoneal injection either purified E. coli LPS at a dose of 10 µg per g body mass or saline alone ( Table 1 ). Within 2 hr LPS-treated animals of both species displayed piloerection and sickness behavior, that is reduced activity, hunched posture, and huddling. By the experiment’s termination at 4 hr, 8 of 10 M. musculus treated with LPS had tachypnea, while only one of ten LPS-treated P. leucopus displayed this sign of the sepsis state ( p=0. 005 ). Within a given species there was little difference between LPS-treated and control animals in values for erythrocytes. But overall the deermice had lower mean ( 95% confidence interval ) hematocrit at 42 ( 36-48 ) %, hemoglobin concentration at 13. 8 g/dL ( 12. 1–15. 5 ), and mean corpuscular volume for erythrocytes at 49 fL ( 47-51 ) than M. musculus with respective values of 56 ( 51-62 ) %, 16. 1 g/dL ( 14. 6–17. 7 ), and 60 fL ( 58-62 ) ( p<0. 01 ). These hematology values for adult CD-1 M. musculus and LL stock P. leucopus in this study were close to what had been reported for these colony populations ( CharlesRiver, 2012; Wiedmeyer et al., 2014 ). In contrast to red blood cells, the mean numbers of white blood cells in the LPS groups in both species were lower than those of control groups ( Figure 1 ). Controls had a mean 4. 9 ( 3. 5–6. 4 ) x 103 white cells per µl among M. musculus and 5. 8 ( 4. 2–7. 4 ) x 103 white cells per µl among P. leucopus ( p=0. 41 ). For the LPS-treated animals the values were 2. 1 ( 1. 5–2. 7 ) x 103 and 2. 3 ( 1 1.–3. 5 ) x103 respectively ( p= 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    Title: 
    Article: Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g., mouse ) but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals. 
 Pyroptosis represents a form of programmed cell death that provokes robust inflammatory immune response ( Bergsbaken et al., 2009; Tsuchiya et al., 2019 ). Gasdermin ( GSDM ) serves as the direct executioner of pyroptosis. GSDM forms transmembrane pores to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, if these transmembrane pores persist, pyroptosis ( Kovacs and Miao, 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2021 ). Humans have six GSDM ( HsGSDM ) family members, HsGSDMA-E, and HsPJVK ( Tamura et al., 2007 ). All HsGSDMs ( except for HsPJVK ) adopt a two-domain architecture, the N-terminal ( NT ) pore-forming domain and the C-terminal ( CT ) autoinhibitory domain ( De Schutter et al., 2021; Shao, 2021 ). Proteolytic cleavage of HsGSDM to remove the autoinhibitory CT domain enables the binding of the lipophilic NT fragment to the cell membrane, where the NT fragments oligomerize and form transmembrane pores to induce osmotic cell lysis ( Kuang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2016 ). Among the signaling pathways that activate GSDM-mediated pyroptosis, caspase ( CASP ) 1/4/5/11-mediated GSDMD activation is well documented. In humans, HsGSDMD is specifically cleaved by the inflammatory HsCASP1 through multiple inflammasome signaling pathways. HsCASP4/5 also cleave HsGSDMD in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation. After cleavage by HsCASP1/4/5, the pore-forming HsGSDMD-NT fragment becomes unconstrained and triggers pyroptosis ( He et al., 2015; Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015 ). Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that HsCASP1/4 βIII/βIII’ sheet forms an exosite that interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain, rendering HsGSDMD cleavage independent of CASP recognition of the tetrapeptide motif FLTD ( Wang et al., 2020b ). When the tetrapeptide FLTD is mutated to AAAD, HsCASP1/4 cleavage of HsGSDMD is not affected. The residues that form the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain are not conserved in HsGSDME, suggesting that HsGSDME cannot be cleaved by HsCASP1/4 via interaction with an exosite ( Liu et al., 2020 ). Actually, human HsGSDME is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, which is required for HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME proteolysis. Mutation of either the Asp residue of the DMPD tetrapeptide motif leads to cleavage resistance of HsGSDME ( Rogers et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017 ), indicating that HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME activation paradigm is distinct from that of HsGSDMD. It is intriguing that although HsCASP7 shares the same recognition motif ( DxxD ) with HsCASP3, HsCASP7 cannot cleave HsGSDME ( Agniswamy et al., 2009; Slee et al., 2001 ). The molecular mechanism underlying the HsCASP3/7 cleavage discrimination of HsGSDME is unknown. Historically, HsCASP3 and HsCASP7, which are 54% identical, are known to possess similar structure and share overlapping protein substrate repertoire, and are considered to have functionally redundant roles in regulating cell death ( Crawford and Wells, 2011; Kumar, 2007; Shi, 2002 ). Both HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 consist of two polypeptide subunits named p20 and p10 ( 1:1 ratio ), which assemble to form active heterotetramer ( Timmer and Salvesen, 2007 ). HsCASP3/7 contain highly conserved QACRG and SHG motifs in p20 subunit, and SWR and GSWF motifs in p10 subunit, which participate in the catalytic reaction and substrate binding, respectively ( Boyce et al., 2004; Cohen, 1997 ). In the apoptosis signaling pathway, death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway ultimately converge to the activation of HsCASP3/7 ( Budd et al., 2000; Wajant, 2002 ). Active HsCASP3/7 cleave a series of protein substrates, including poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45, which causes chromatin fragmentation and leads to apoptosis ( Erener et al., 2012; Wolf et al., 1999; Zheng et al., 1998 ). Although HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 exert almost indistinguishable proteolytic specificity to certain polypeptides, there exist functional differences between these two HsCASPs in cleaving some substrates ( Brentnall et al., 2013; Demon et al., 2009 ). For instance, HsCASP3 cleaves Bid much more efficiently than HsCASP7, while HsCASP7 cleaves cochaperone p23 more efficiently than HsCASP3 ( Slee et al., 2001; Walsh et al., 2008 ). These findings support the notion that HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 are enzymatically similar but functionally non-redundant. Different from HsGSDME that is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3, teleost GSDME is cleaved via various modes ( Angosto-Bazarra et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2022 ). In this study, we identified a functional GSDME ( named TrGSDME ) from pufferfish ( Takifugu rubripes ). We found that TrGSDME was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3/7 and TrCASP3/7, whereas HsGSDME was cleaved by TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3, but not by HsCASP7. We examined the underlying mechanism of this observation. We found that the GSDME-CT and the CASP7 p10 were critical for CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. By a series of site-directed mutagenesis, we discovered a previously unrecognized key residue ( S234 in HsCASP7 ) in p10 that was responsible for the discriminative cleavage of HsGSDME by HsCASP7. 
 It has long been observed that although human caspase ( HsCASP ) 3 and 7 share the same consensus recognition motif DxxD, HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaves human GSDME ( HsGSDME ) ( at the site of DMPD ) ( Poreba et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013 ). The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified pyroptic puffer GME ( TrSD ) that was cleaved by both puffer CAS3/7 and human CAS3/7. Domain swapping between puffer and human CAS and GME showed that GME-CT and CAS7p10 determined the cleavage of GME by CAS7. CAS7 contains a key residue that governs CAS7 substrate discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS3 and most vertebrate ( except mammalian CAS7. In mammals, the residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g. mouse ) but not primates. However, CAS7 cleaved GME but mouseME not GME. These findings revealed the mechanism of CAS7 substrate discrimination and divergence of CAS3-mediated GME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated alteration of CAS probably enabled divergence and specialization of CAS members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.

    Title: 
    Article: Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression. However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study, with participants blinded to their treatment condition. 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine ( initial bolus 0. 23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0. 58 mg/kg/hr ). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets. We found that: ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; ( ii ) ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. This study was supported by NIH grants DP5OD012109-01 ( A.

 Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) ( Krystal et al., 2019 ). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with TRD ( Murrough et al., 2013; Hack et al., 2021 ). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects ( e. g. NMDA receptor occupancy ) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms ( Murrough et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2008; Honey et al., 2008 ). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture such effects. In this study, we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine. Ketamine’s effects have been extensively characterised by group studies, which typically involve recruiting a sample of patients, measuring brain activity before and after ketamine infusion, and then averaging the results across the patients ( i. e. relying on the power of central tendency ) to ascertain ketamine’s effects. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine produces transient changes in behavior, perception, and cognition that are comparable to the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms seen in patients with psychosis-spectrum illness ( Krystal et al., 1994 ). Therefore, ketamine’s acute behavioral effects are typically captured using psychosis-related scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ), as well as cognitive tasks ( Anticevic et al., 2012 ). However, the acute neural effects of subanesthetic of ketamine are less clear. The majority of studies exploring ketamine’s neural alterations have used seed-based approaches, which often result in contradictory results and are fundamentally limited by the required a-priori selection of a seed region and an inability to fully capture ketamine’s systems-level alterations ( Scheidegger et al., 2012; Niesters et al., 2012; Dandash et al., 2015; Grimm et al., 2015; Höflich et al., 2015; Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015; Bonhomme et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2016; Kraguljac et al., 2017; Liebe et al., 2018; Mueller et al., 2018; Fleming et al., 2019; Hack et al., 2021; Cole et al., 2010; Fitzgerald, 2012 ). For instance, studies have identified both ketamine-induced increases and decreases in thalamo-cortical and hippocampal-cortical activity ( Höflich et al., 2015; Hack et al., 2021; Grimm et al., 2015; Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015; Kraguljac et al., 2017 ). There is evidence that these inconsistencies may stem in part from a failure to account for individual differences in ketamine response. Ketamine has demonstrated dose-dependent individual variability in thalamic functional connectivity in healthy adults, with some individuals showing dose-dependent increases in functional connectivity, and others showing decreases ( Hack et al., 2021 ). A limited number of studies have also characterised ketamine’s neural systems-level functional alterations using whole-brain approaches, demonstrating that ketamine results in robust brain-wide effects. For example, ketamine has been shown to increase global brain connectivity ( GBC ) in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) in healthy controls specifically, and normalize the reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hr post-ketamine ( Anticevic et al., 2015; Abdallah et al., 2017; Abdallah et al., 2018 ). However, this finding failed to replicate in patients with depression 48 hr post-ketamine ( Kraus et al., 2020 ), suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine’s acute and delayed effects. In addition to GBC, graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum ( Joules et al., 2015 ). Meanwhile, a nodal predictive model found ketamine resulted in reduced connectivity within the primary cortices and the executive network, but increased connectivity between the executive network and the rest of brain ( Abdallah et al., 2021 ). Finally, dynamic resting-state functional connectivity showed that ketamine decreased connectivity both within the left visual network and inter-hemispherically between the visual networks ( Spies et al., 2019 ). However, these studies also fail to account for individual differences in response to ketamine. The main limitation of relying on the power of central tendency is that meaningful differences between individual subjects may be lost through the process of averaging. One method that has been used to successfully address this and uncover individual differences in psychiatric research is a principal component analysis ( PCA ) ( Ji et al., 2020; Halai et al., 2017 ). A PCA is a data-driven method that is able to uncover both group-level and individual-level differences. More specifically, a PCA allows us to test the hypothesis that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional: if ketamine’s effects are uniform then we would expect a PCA to result in one principal component on which all the participants can be mapped; however if there are systemic differences between participants, we would anticipate a PCA to generate multiple principle components. A PCA is also able to capture individual-level differences through an individual’s relative positioning along the axes of the principal components ( Halai et al., 2017 ). In order to assess the relative merits of characterizing ketamine’s acute effects using a uni-dimensional ( i. e. mean-level ) or multi-dimensional ( i. e. PCA ) approach, we will compare which results best relate to ketamine’s hypothesized molecular mechanisms. We will focus on the indirect hypothesis, which posits that ketamine first inhibits tonic-firing GABAergic interneurons via NMDAR blockade, leading to a burst of glutamate that drives synaptic plasticity ( Gerhard et al., 2020 ). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that individual differences in ketamine’s neural systems-level effects are associated with SST and PVALB GABAergic interneurons by correlating ketamine’s neural effects with SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps derived from the Allen Human Brain Atlas ( AHBA ). SST and PVALB genes were selected a priori based on their role in GABAergic interneuron function and ketamine’s hypothesized mechanism of action. We will also test the hypothesis that individual differences in ketamine behavioral effects are associated with ketamine’s neural effects by correlating ketamine’s behavioral effects with ketamine’s neural effects. This will allow us to determine whether ketamine’s effects are uni- or multi-dimensional and whether individual differences in ketamine response can be captured at the single-subject level. In this study, 40 healthy participants received a ketamine infusion and underwent resting-state functional MRI ( rsfMRI ) scans before and after the infusion. Participants were blinded to their treatment condition, and the study was conducted in a single-blind manner. rsMRI data were pre-processed and analyzed using the CONN toolbox ( Whitfield et al. 2011 ) to extract functional connectivity matrices. PCA was applied to the connectivity matrices to identify principal components. We correlated ketamine’s neural effects with SST and PVAL gene expression and behavioral effects with ketamine’s neural effects. We found that ( i ) ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional reflecting interindividual variability ( ii ) ketamine’s principal gradient matched SST and PVAL cortical expression in humans while the mean did not ( iii ) behavioral-driven symptom variation mapped onto distinct ketamine gradients resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual and neural variation in response to ketamine and have implications for the development of precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment in psychiatry.

    Title: 
    Article: The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life, primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. Autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed. Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence, thereby maintaining diversity. Here, we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( ‘genes’ ), while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes. 
 Current knowledge of nucleotide chemistry as well as a large body of indirect evidence from recent organisms support the RNA world hypothesis; a concept that once RNA fulfilled the role of an evolvable primordial informational polymer and biochemical reaction catalyst at the same time ( Woese, 1965; Crick, 1968; Orgel, 1968; Orgel, 1992; Gilbert, 1986; Benner et al., 1989; Joyce, 2002; Lee et al., 2023 ). However, the initial weaknesses of the original RNA world hypothesis, such as the lack of a reliable replication mechanism and the consequential loss of heritable information ( Bernhardt, 2012; Szostak, 2012; Le Vay and Mutschler, 2019 ), have prompted scientists studying the origin of life to devise a wide variety of physicochemically refined models of the RNA world. A potentially promising suggestion is that prior to template replication of complex polymers catalyzed by an RNA polymerase ribozyme ( i. e. replicase ), genetic information and catalytic functions were initially distributed among short sequence modules that could occasionally be ligated to increase molecular complexity in a stepwise manner ( Vlassov et al., 2005; Manrubia and Briones, 2007; Briones et al., 2009 ). Replication of these short sequence modules ( perhaps with some catalytic properties ) could have occurred in the absence of a replicase ribozyme, driven by some template-directed, non-enzymatic replication mechanism ( von Kiedrowski, 1986; Zielinski and Orgel, 1987; Patzke and Kiedrowski, 2007; Leu et al., 2011; Leu et al., 2013 ). Thus, templated, enzyme-free replication in pools of nucleic acid oligomers that resulted from random abiotic polymerization may have contributed to the emergence of structured oligonucleotides during prebiotic evolution ( Le Vay and Mutschler, 2019; Rosenberger et al., 2021 ). For example, it has been experimentally demonstrated that activated oligonucleotides can act as catalysts for non-enzymatic replication of RNA containing all four nucleotides, with the fidelity sufficient to sustain a genome size large enough to encode active ribozymes ( Prywes et al., 2016 ). If enzyme-free replication of oligomers with a high degree of sequence variability was indeed attainable from prebiotic chemistry, then it becomes a vital issue how a critical level of diversity of the associated genetic information ( Szostak, 2011 ) could be preserved under competition among distinct replicator types with different competitive abilities ( e. g. replicabilities ) ( Eigen, 1971; Szathmáry, 1991; Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995; Jiménez et al., 2013; Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2017 ). This recognition calls for elucidation of the coexistence mechanisms that could have alleviated the competition among independently replicating information carrying modules. For instance, parabolic growth dynamics, a kinetic behavior observed in non-enzymatic self-replicating systems ( von Kiedrowski, 1986 ), has been proposed as an ideal candidate mechanism to sustain a large amount of prebiotic genetic information ( Szathmáry and Gladkih, 1989; Scheuring and Szathmáry, 2001 ). In this kinetics, the growth order p is equal or close to 0. 5 ( i. e. the dynamics is sub-exponential ) because increased stability of the template-copy complex ( rate of association divided by dissociation ) promotes parabolic growth ( von Kiedrowski et al., 1991; von Kiedrowski and Szathmáry, 2001 ). This is in sharp contrast to exponential growth, where p=1 implies maximum dissociation that allows for fast autocatalysis ( Tjivikua et al., 1990; von Kiedrowski et al., 1991 ). Thus, replicating individuals in populations displaying parabolic growth kinetics are inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, a feature that can efficiently damp competition and therefore promote coexistence. Indeed, parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit ( Szathmáry and Gladkih, 1989; Varga and Szathmáry, 1997 ). However, molecular evolution of the Darwinian type is thought to necessitate exponential, rather than parabolic amplification, because in the latter case robust coexistence of the competing replicator species generally limits the efficiency of natural selection ( Sievers and von Kiedrowski, 1998; Szilágyi et al., 2017; Strazewski, 2019 ). Therefore, a major current focus in models of parabolic replication is how to incorporate Darwinian selection into its dynamics ( Lifson and Lifson, 1999; Scheuring and Szathmáry, 2001; von Kiedrowski and Szathmáry, 2001 ). While the latter models considerably improved the parabolic replication model framework in terms of its potential to incorporate evolvability, they did not account for the copying error threshold of their respective systems; i. e., an error rate of the replication mechanism at which the system’s ability to stably propagate genetic information from generation to generation is prohibited, resulting in irreversible loss of sequence-coded information ( Eigen, 1971; Joyce, 2002; Szostak, 2012 ). The possibility that high mutation rates could lead to such an ‘error catastrophe’ is one of the major caveats surrounding the RNA world hypothesis, given that the first RNA replication mechanisms have probably been inherently error-prone ( Eigen, 1971; Manrubia and Briones, 2007; Leu et al., 2011 ). Moreover, practically no study is known to have treated parabolic replication so that physicochemical details and ecological constraints, together with stochastic effects ( that supposedly also have considerable impact on finite systems ), would have been taken into consideration. The present study aims to remedy these deficiencies by quantifying the heritable information-maintaining potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like template replicators displaying parabolic growth modeled as stochastic dynamics. We represent the replicator sequences individually, and copying error as well as energetic constraints in strand separation are also considered explicitly. Using a constant population model version of this framework, we first investigate how the diversity-maintaining mechanisms operate in the parabolic regime in a finite population of replicators. We further demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, thereby proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world. In order for our stochastic simulation results to be comparable with the theoretical error threshold of parabolic dynamics, we analytically calculate the equilibrium master ( i. e. fittest sequence ) concentrations as a function of the copying fidelity and the reproductive superiority of the master sequences relative to the mutants. We also compare the error threshold in case of parabolic dynamics to the case of the exponential dynamics. Finally, in order to validate that Darwinian selection by competitive exclusion is also feasible in this framework, we consider a chemostat model of parabolic replication, in which monomer building block resources are additionally taken into account. Using this approach, we demonstrate that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, can induce a switch from the coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest. 
 We consider populations of oligomer molecules based on nucleotide-like monomer constituents ( to preserve generality for potential informational polymers other than RNA ). Individual molecules are represented by their primary ( monomeric sequence ) structures and are assumed to undergo template-directed, non-enzymatic replication. This replication mode converts a single-stranded plus- or minus-strand template into a template-copy duplex. Strand separation rates of these duplexes are relatively low compared to strand association ( e. g. dissociation ) rates, leading to parabolic growth kinetics ( voniedki et al, 1991; Kiedki et al,199 ). The model is based on the following assumptions : ( i ) the population size is constant and finite, ( ii ) replication is template-directed and nonenzymatic, and ( iii ) separation of duplexes is relatively slow compared to association. The population size of replicators is denoted by N and the number of monomers in a replicator is denoted by n. Each replicator is represented by a sequence of length n monomers, and the number of replicators in the population is denoted by N. The number of monomers in the pool is denoted by M and the number of monomers in a replicator is denoted by m. The number of monomers in the pool is denoted by M and the number of monomers in replicator is denoted by m. The number of monomers in the pool is denoted M and the number of monomers in replicator denoted by m. The number of monomers in the pool denoted M and number of monomers in replicator denoted by m The number of monomers in pool denoted M and number of monomers in replic denoted by m The number of monomers pool denoted M and number monomers in replic denoted by The number of monomers denoted M and monomers in replic denoted by The number of monomers denoted and monomers in denoted by The number monomers denoted and mon in denoted by The monomers denoted and in denoted by The mon denoted and in denoted by denoted The denoted and denoted by denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted denoted den

    Title: 
    Article: Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic ( Lamers and Haagmans, 2022; Merad et al., 2022 ). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, which includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 ( SARS-CoV-1 ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) ( reviewed in Hartenian et al., 2020 ). SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the human respiratory tract and lungs, which can clinically manifest as an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Once delivered into the host cell, the incoming positive-strand viral RNA genome is first translated by host ribosomes into two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Viral polyproteins are then proteolytically processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins ( Nsps ) involved in the assembly of the viral replication-transcription complex ( reviewed in V’kovski et al., 2021 ). The Nsps also participate in disrupting host cellular processes and pathways to escape immune recognition and facilitate viral propagation ( reviewed in Minkoff and tenOever, 2023; Suryawanshi et al., 2021 ). The maturation step to release the individual Nsp polypeptides is executed by two viral-encoded proteases: Nsp5 ( also known as Main Protease, MPro/3C-like protease ) and Nsp3 ( also known as Papain-Like Protease, PLPro ) ( Narayanan et al., 2022 ). Nsp3 is contained within pp1a and releases itself from the polyprotein through self-cleavage. Nsp3 also cleaves pp1a at multiple sites to release Nsp1 through Nsp4 ( Yan and Wu, 2021 ). The Nsp5 main protease processes pp1b at eleven sites to release itself and Nsp4 to Nsp16 ( Chen et al., 2021 ). Besides cleaving viral substrates, Nsp3 and Nsp5 have also been found to cleave endogenous host proteins linked to the immune response and cell survival ( Liu et al., 2021; Meyer et al., 2021; Meyers et al., 2021; Moustaqil et al., 2021; Wenzel et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021b ). Nsp3 and Nsp5 are essential for viral replication and represent well-characterized drug targets among coronaviruses. Notably, the active component of the antiviral drug Paxlovid is nirmatrelvir, a reversible covalent inhibitor of the Nsp5 main protease ( Owen et al., 2021 ). By inhibiting Nsp5 proteolytic activity, Paxlovid reduces viral replication and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Purification of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins from human cells have identified a potential interaction between a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 with human TRMT1 ( Gordon et al., 2020a ). A cross-coronavirus investigation from the same group has extended this observation by finding that TRMT1 interacts with a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 encoded by SARS-CoV-1, which is 98. 7% similar to SARS-CoV-2 ( Gordon et al., 2020b ). Interestingly, the same study found no detectable interaction between TRMT1 and Nsp5 encoded by MERS-CoV, which has 66. 8% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. TRMT1 was also identified as a potential interactor with catalytic-inactive Nsp5 using proximity-dependent biotinylation ( Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2020 ). TRMT1 is a tRNA modification enzyme that catalyzes the formation of dimethylguanosine ( m2, 2G ) at position 26 in more than half of all human tRNAs ( Dewe et al., 2017; Jonkhout et al., 2021 ). The m2, 2G modification is located at a key structural position in tRNAs and is hypothesized to play a role in proper tRNA folding ( Pallan et al., 2008; Steinberg and Cedergren, 1995 ). TRMT1-deficient human cells exhibit perturbations in global protein synthesis and decreased proliferation ( Dewe et al., 2017 ). Moreover, loss-of-function variants in the TRMT1 gene are the cause of certain types of intellectual disability disorders in humans ( Blaesius et al., 2018; Najmabadi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Thus, changes in TRMT1 activity can impact protein synthesis leading to downstream cellular and biological effects. The life cycle of many viruses has been linked to host tRNA biology ( reviewed in Dremel et al., 2023; Nunes et al., 2020 ). In one well-known example, retroviruses such as HIV use cellular tRNAs as primers for reverse transcription and other viral functions ( reviewed in Jin and Musier-Forsyth, 2019 ). DNA and RNA viruses can also impact tRNA synthesis, processing, and charging to modulate infection and pathogenesis ( Dremel et al., 2022; Netzer et al., 2009; Tucker et al., 2020 ). In a recent study, Chikungunya RNA virus infection has been shown to increase the expression of a human tRNA modification enzyme and alter tRNA modification patterns to favor viral protein expression ( Jungfleisch et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles exhibit an enrichment of specific host tRNAs with distinct modification profiles ( Peña et al., 2022 ). Moreover, analysis of RNA extracted from human nose swabs have identified tRNA profiles and modification signatures associated with mild versus severe COVID-19 ( Katanski et al., 2022 ). The change in tRNA modification profiles could represent another mechanism employed by SARS-CoV-2 to take over translation in addition to previously described strategies ( Finkel et al., 2021 ). The putative interaction between Nsp5 and TRMT1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection could affect the function of TRMT1 with consequent effects on tRNA modification levels. However, the association between Nsp5 and TRMT1 has not been validated nor characterized. Here, we find that TRMT1 is an endogenous cleavage target of Nsp5 resulting in methyltransferase inactive cleavage products. Moreover, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2, 2G-modified tRNAs. In addition, we provide evidence that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. These studies uncover TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications. 
 To test the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on TRMT1 and tRNA modifications, we used an MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cell line expressing the ACE2 receptor that is permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Raymonda et al., 2022; Uemura et al., 2021a; Uemura et al., 2021b ). MRC-5 cells were mock-infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by harvesting at 24- and 48 hr post-infection for sample analysis. Western blotting was used to detect TR1 protein levels in cell lysates ( Fig. 1A ). TR1 levels were significantly decreased in SARSV-2-infected cells compared to mock-infected cells at both time points ( p 0. 0 0 0 5 ). To confirm TR1 cleavage by N5, we immunoprecipitated N5 from SARS-2-infected M-5 cells and detected TR1 by Western blotting ( Fig.1B ). N5 coimmunoprecipitated with TR1 at 24 and 48 hr postinfection. To determine the cleavage site of TR1 by N5, we performed mass spectrometry on immunoprecipitated N5 from S-2 infected M-5 cells ( Fig.2A ) TR1 was cleaved by N5 at a site matching the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites ( Fig.2B ) A mutation at the cleavage site inhibited N5-dependent proteolysis of TR1 ( Fig.2C ) To examine the effects of TR1 cleavage on tRNA modification, we isolated tRNA from M-5 cells infected with SARS-2 at 24 and 48 hr postinfection ( Fig.3 ) m2G-modified tRNAs were significantly reduced in S-2 infected cells compared to mock-infected cells ( p 0 0 0 0 5 ) To assess the role of TR1 in SARSV-2 replication, we transfected M- cells with TR1 siRNA and infected with SARS-2 ( Fig.4 ) TR1-deficient cells exhibited reduced intracellular viral RNA compared to wild-type cells ( p 0 0 0 0 5 ) To determine if TR1-deficient cells could rescue tRNA modification, we transfected M- cells with TR1 cDNA and infected S- ( Fig.5 ) TR1-expressing cells exhibited increased m2G-modified tRNAs compared to TR-deficient cells ( p 0 0 0 0 5 ) Finally, we tested if TR1-deficient cells could rescue viral replication by transfecting with TR1 cDNA and infecting S- ( Fig.6 ) TR-expressing cells exhibited increased intracellular RNA compared to TR-deficient cells ( 0 0 0 5 ) These results indicate that TR1 is required for efficient SARS-2 replication and that TR-deficient cells can rescue tRNA modification and viral replication by expressing TR1
The article discusses the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (N5) and the human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1) enzyme, which is involved in post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs. The study shows that N5 cleaves TR1, leading to a decrease in TR1 levels and m2G-modified tRNAs in SARS-2-infected cells, and that TR1 is required for efficient SARS-2 replication in human cells. The findings suggest that N-dependent cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of tRNA patterns contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-2 infection.

    Title: 
    Article: Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens; rather, they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental virulence’, replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes— biofilm formation and flor formation— increased; another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to the nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. Hence, selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence. Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens. 
 The study of infectious disease often focuses on pathogenic microbes that either specialize in exploiting animal hosts or act as commensals that switch to pathogenesis when the delicate balance between host and microbe is perturbed. These microbes are presumed to have co-evolved complex adaptations that allow survival and reproduction in and on hosts. However, there exists a broad range of microbial organisms that live in the open environment ( i. e. soil, vegetation, aquatic habitats ) that are capable of causing disease when the opportunity presents itself ( Brown et al., 2012 ). Such microbes also have adaptations that allow host exploitation, but the origin of these adaptations is unclear, as growth and survival in a host is not a required part of the lifecycle ( Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007 ). For example, the soil-associated bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Selezska et al., 2012 ) and Burkholderia cepacia ( Mahenthiralingam et al., 2008 ) can infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. The existence of virulence traits in environmentally-derived opportunistic pathogens may be due to selection favoring the traits for other uses in the non-host environment, which challenges the idea that co-evolution is a requirement of microbial pathogenesis and virulence. This hypothesis, first proposed and explored in the bacterial literature, is known as ‘coincidental selection’ ( Levin and Svanborg Edén, 1990 ). Much of the research testing the coincidental selection hypothesis has focused on the biotic environment as a selective pressure, specifically the role of predatory bacteriophages and protists ( reviewed in [Sun et al., 2018; Davies et al., 2016; Erken et al., 2013] ). The relationship between virulence, bacteria, and their predators is complex ( Brüssow, 2007 ). For example, a positive relationship between amoeba predation and virulence was shown in Escherichia coli ( Adiba et al., 2010 ), while selection by amoeba predation led to a decrease virulence in P. aeruginosa ( Leong et al., 2022 ). In the same bacterial species, an evolution experiment with both protist and phage predators showed that phage could mitigate the decrease in virulence associated with protist predation ( Friman and Buckling, 2014 ). Despite the complexity, it is clear that selection from the biotic environment can strongly influence bacterial virulence. A hypothesis similar to coincidental selection, known as ‘accidental virulence’, has been proposed ( Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007 ) and explored in parallel in the eukaryotic microbial literature, also with a focus on the biotic environment ( reviewed in Siscar-Lewin et al., 2022; Casadevall et al., 2019 ). For example, in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, traits that protect from predatory amoeba also play a role in human infection ( Steenbergen et al., 2001 ), and selection by amoeba can increase the prevalence of such traits ( Fu et al., 2021; Steenbergen et al., 2003 ). Similarly, co-culturing Paracoccidioides fungi with amoeba can lead to increased virulence ( Albuquerque et al., 2019 ). In both the bacterial and eukaryotic literature, there has been less focus on the role of selection imposed by the abiotic environment, although temperature is increasingly a consideration, as thermotolerance and halotolerance may make colonization in and on humans more likely ( Casadevall, 2020; Garcia-Solache and Casadevall, 2010 ). For example, the emerging opportunistic yeast Candida auris, which is found in warm and salty coastal wetlands, can cause severe systemic infection ( Arora et al., 2021 ). There is also experimental evidence that increased temperature can select for virulence in P. aeruginosa ( Friman et al., 2011 ). The dual-use virulence traits that can be under ‘coincidental selection’ and lead to ‘accidental virulence’ are numerous and range from toxin production, such as the production of gliotoxin in the soil-dwelling filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus ( Hillmann et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2021 ), to protective structures, such as capsule formation in C. neoformans ( Casadevall et al., 2003 ). Another type of trait, which is the focus of the research presented here, is adherence. Adherence is important for many microbial behaviors required for survival ( e. g., biofilm formation ) ( West et al., 2007 ), but can also play a role in pathogenicity and virulence ( Douglas, 2003; Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004 ). The ability to adhere to and invade tissues, as well as form communities resistant to anti-microbials, can be key to successful pathogenicity. In the soil-associated yeast, Blastomyces dermatitidis ( Baumgardner and Laundre, 2001 ), which can cause lung infections, the deletion of a single adhesin gene abolishes pathogenesis ( Klein, 2000 ). The function of microbial traits in both the open environment and the host is crucial evidence for the coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis. However, experimental evolution allows the idea to be tested directly; thus far, most evolution experiments have focused on co-culturing opportunistic microbes with predators ( e. g., [Leong et al., 2022; Friman and Buckling, 2014; Fu et al., 2021; Steenbergen et al., 2003; Albuquerque et al., 2019; Friman et al., 2011; Mikonranta et al., 2012; Hosseinidoust et al., 2013] ). In the research presented here, rather than altering the biotic or abiotic environment and determining the effect on virulence, we apply direct selection to a specific trait hypothesized to be dual-use in the biomedical model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aside from serving as a model for genetics and cell biology, and being found in a myriad of ecological niches around the globe ( Peter et al., 2018 ), S. cerevisiae is also an opportunistic pathogen capable of infecting immunocompromised individuals, with reports of infections increasing ( Aucott et al., 1990; Muñoz et al., 2005; Llopis et al., 2014; Enache-Angoulvant and Hennequin, 2005; Hennequin et al., 2000; Pérez-Torrado and Querol, 2015 ). As such, it has been a model for fungal pathogenesis-related traits ( Clemons et al., 1994; Fraser et al., 2012; McCusker et al., 1994a; Phadke et al., 2018 ). Some environmentally derived strains are capable of adhering to surfaces and expressing associated aggregative phenotypes ( Verstrepen and Klis, 2006 ). These range from biofilms on solid and semi-solid agar, to pseudohyphal growth and agar invasion, to floating mats on liquid surfaces ( flors ). Of these multicellular phenotypes, only invasive and pseudohyphal growth have been linked to pathogenicity in S. cerevisiae ( McCusker et al., 1994a; Phadke et al., 2018; Palecek et al., 2002 ), although biofilm formation has been linked to pathogenicity in other fungi ( Fanning and Mitchell, 2012 ). Not all strains are capable of expressing these phenotypes. In this study, populations of S. cerevisiae were evolved to adhere to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with adherence, two multicellular phenotypes—biofilm formation and pseudohyhal growth—increased; another phenotype, pseudohyph growth responded to nutrient limitation. Thus, selection led to the evolution of highly adherent, multicellular strains. Wax moth larvae injected with evolved-multic strains were significantly more likely to die than injected with nonmultic strains. Hence, selection on adherence incidentally led to the evolution of multicellularity and increased virulence Our results support the idea that selection for a beneficial trait in the open can generate opportunistic ‘accidental pathogens.

    Title: 
    Article: Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Here, we exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins ( hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1 ). Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested, suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates. Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. 
 Biomolecular condensates are highly multicomponent systems with remarkable specificity: they exhibit non-random molecular compositions and, concomitantly, contain distinct physicochemical environments defined by the collective behavior of their components ( Banani et al., 2017; Li et al., 2012 ). Phase separation has emerged as a leading mechanism to account for the formation of biomolecular condensates. In this thermodynamic process, segregative ( density-driven ) and associative ( connectivity-driven ) transitions are coupled to produce protein- and nucleic acid-rich phases suspended in the cellular cytoplasm or nucleoplasm ( Mittag and Pappu, 2022 ). Within this framework, intrinsically disordered proteins/regions ( IDP/IDRs ) have emerged as strong contributors to the multivalency and phase separation capacity of many naturally occurring proteins ( Shin and Brangwynne, 2017; Banani et al., 2017; Gomes and Shorter, 2019; Nott et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2020; Martin and Holehouse, 2020; Posey et al., 2018; Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015 ). Moreover, IDRs characterized by amino acid sequences of low complexity and enriched in aromatic residues, such as the PLDs of RNA–binding proteins ( Franzmann et al., 2018; Maharana et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Gotor et al., 2020; Molliex et al., 2015 ), are prone to form condensates that behave like viscous fluids. Furthermore, the PLDs of various naturally occurring proteins, such as Fused in Sarcoma ( FUS ), Trans-activation response DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP-43 ), and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 ( hnRNPA1 ) have been reported to transition from liquid-like condensates into dynamically arrested solids and glasses over time ( Jawerth et al., 2020; Alshareedah et al., 2023 ). Such arrested states have been postulated as precursors of pathological protein aggregates and amyloids ( Linsenmeier et al., 2022 ). Understanding the molecular factors that regulate the ability of PLDs to phase separate is of crucial importance, as these are conjectured to also facilitate their aggregation ( Sprunger and Jackrel, 2021 ). Biomolecular condensates are networked fluids sustained by multivalent macromolecules that interconnect with more than two partners simultaneously ( Li et al., 2012; Banani et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2020a; Choi et al., 2020b; Banani et al., 2017; Harmon et al., 2017 ). Thus, the factors that increase the molecular valency, give rise to more densely connected liquid networks, and more stable condensates ( Banani et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2020a; Iserman et al., 2020; Adame-Arana et al., 2020; Munder et al., 2016; Cinar et al., 2019 ). For PLDs, multivalency has been shown to be strongly promoted by the presence of aromatic residues, which act as ‘stickers’ that enable associative π–π interactions, and also cation–π contacts with arginine and lysine ( Fisher and Elbaum-Garfinkle, 2020; Martin et al., 2020; Krainer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2018; Joseph et al., 2021; Bremer et al., 2022; Brady et al., 2017; Vernon et al., 2018; Fossat et al., 2021 ). Indeed, the range of the coexistence of PLD condensates has been shown to change most significantly in response to mutations involving aromatic residues ( Martin and Mittag, 2018; Martin et al., 2020 ). Quantitative experimental phase diagrams for a set of hnRNPA1-IDR variants in combination with mean-field simulations demonstrated that tyrosine drives stronger associative interactions than phenylalanine, arginine’s effects are context-specific, and lysine destabilizes PLD–PLD interactions ( Bremer et al., 2022 ). More importantly, such a study demonstrates that, at least for hnRNPA1, there exist quantitative rules that explain the changes in thermodynamic parameters of condensates in response to precise amino-acid sequence mutations. In this work, we investigate whether there are scaling laws that can predict how the critical parameters of a broader set of PLDs change in response to amino acid sequence mutations. Scaling laws are mathematical relationships that describe how the properties of a system change for a given variable, such as its size or composition ( Ball, 1991 ). In the context of polymer-like systems such as IDPs, scaling laws have offered invaluable insight into vastly different aspects of their physical behavior: for example, they were instrumental in determining that the relationship between viscosity and radius of gyration in polymer solutions is described by a power law between the two quantities Dunstan, 2019; demonstrating that aging scaling during polymer collapse is a universal property in homopolymers Majumder et al., 2020; determining that in single polymer systems, their end-to-end distance is directly proportional to their length Rubinstein and Colby, 2003; showing that foldable sequences with more compact unfolded states are recent products of protein evolution ( Hofmann et al., 2012 ). In the context of protein condensates, we hypothesized that scaling laws, if found, may allow us to quantify how condensates respond to different intrinsic perturbations—such as amino acid mutations or presence/absence of different post-translational modifications, changes in protein length, increased/decreased flexibility—or external stimuli—such as changes to the pH of the medium or the ionic environment. Thus, we focused on determining if such laws exist for PLDs by exploring six different RNA-binding proteins ( i. e. hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1; Figure 1A and B ), linked to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders through pathology and genetics ( Clarke et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2008; Jo et al., 2020; Ash et al., 2021; Apicco et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2014; Lagier-Tourenne and Cleveland, 2009; Couthouis et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2019; Li et al., 2013 ). Leveraging the accuracy and efficiency of a modern sequence-dependent coarse-grained model ( Joseph et al., 2021 ), we quantify the phase diagrams ( temperature-vs-density plane ) of a large set of mutants spanning all six PLDs mentioned above. We performed Direct Coexistence molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations ( Figure 1C ), exploring simultaneously the protein-rich and protein-depleted phases of the condensate for each mutant, in the temperature–concentration phase space. Our set of simulations encompass 140 PLD mutants, each sampled at 8–12 different temperatures. Accounting for independent replicas to ensure proper sampling and convergence, the dataset presented here comprises the results of approximately 2000 independent Direct Coexistence simulations ( Figure 1D, Appendix 1—figure 6 ), totaling 1. 2 milliseconds of accumulated sampling. Our work puts forward a data-driven scaling-law framework for the study of PLD phase behavior. We reveal that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs, as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations ( e. g. aromatic, positively charged, etc ), can indeed be quantified by scaling laws, which are conserved across the family of PLDs we investigate. The addition of aromatic residues yields a positive linear correlation between mutation fraction and critical temperature ( Figure 2A ), while the addition of positively charged residues results in a negative correlation ( Figure 2B ). These findings are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend to the entire tested set of PLDs, suggesting that scaling can be used to predict changes in the stability of PL condens. Our work offers a quantitative lens into the emergent behavior of PL solutions in response to physico changes of PL molecules.

    Title: 
    Article: Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex, high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine. 
 Observing a person’s behaviour over time is how we understand the individual’s personality, cognitive traits, or psychiatric condition. The same should apply at the brain level, where we may be able to gain crucial insights by observing the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time, that is brain dynamics. One way of describing brain dynamics are state-space models, which allow capturing recurring patterns of activity and functional connectivity ( FC ) across the whole brain. However, although research into brain dynamics has recently gained traction ( Breakspear, 2017; Calhoun et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2005; Hutchison et al., 2013; Liégeois et al., 2017 ), it is still unclear how best to use this spatiotemporal level of description to characterise subject differences or predict individual traits from brain signals. One reason why brain dynamics are not usually considered in this context pertains to their representation: They are represented using models of varying complexity that are estimated from modalities such as functional MRI or MEG. Although there exists a variety of methods for estimating time-varying or dynamic FC ( Lurie et al., 2020 ), like the commonly used sliding-window approach, there is currently no widely accepted way of using them for prediction problems. This is because these models are usually parametrised by a high number of parameters with complex mathematical relationships between the parameters that reflect the model assumptions. How to leverage these parameters for prediction is currently an open question. We here propose the Fisher kernel for predicting individual traits from brain dynamics, using information from generative models that do not assume any knowledge of task timings. We focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans, in this case acquired during wakeful rest, and how the parameters from these models can be used to predict behavioural variables or traits. In particular, we use the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ), which is a probabilistic generative model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity ( FC ) dynamics ( Vidaurre et al., 2017 ). HMMs have previously been shown to be able to predict certain complex subject traits, such as fluid intelligence, more accurately than structural or static ( time-averaged ) FC representations ( Vidaurre et al., 2021 ). We combine the HMM with the Fisher kernel, which allows for the efficient use of the entire set of parameters from the generative model. The Fisher kernel takes the complex relationships between the model parameters into account by preserving the structure of the underlying model ( here, the HMM; Jaakkola et al., 1999; Jaakkola and Haussler, 1998 ). Mathematically, the HMM parameters lie on a Riemannian manifold ( the structure ). This defines, for instance, the relation between parameters, such as: how changing one parameter, like the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another, would affect the fitting of other parameters, like the states’ FC. It also defines the relative importance of each parameter; for example, how a change of 0. 1 in the transition probabilities would not be the same as a change of 0. 1 in one edge of the states’ FC matrices. For empirical evaluation, we consider two criteria that are important in both scientific and practical applications. First, predictions should be as accurate as possible, that is the correlation between predicted and actual values should be high. Second, predictions should be reliable, in the sense that a predictive model should never produce excessively large errors, and the outcome should be robust to reasonable variations in the data set, for example the choice of which subjects from the same population are included in the training set. The latter criterion is especially important if we want to be able to meaningfully interpret prediction errors, for example in assessing brain age ( Cole and Franke, 2017; Denissen et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2019 ). Despite this crucial role in interpreting model errors, reliability is not often considered in models predicting individual traits from neuroimaging features. In summary, we show that using the Fisher kernel approach, which preserves the mathematical structure of the underlying HMM, we can predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably. We show that our approach significantly outperforms methods that do not take the mathematical structure of the model into account, as well as methods based on time-averaged FC that do not consider brain dynamics. For interpretation, we also investigate which aspects of the model drive the prediction accuracy, both in real data and in simulations. Bringing accuracy, reliability and interpretation together, this work opens possibilities for practical applications such as the development of biomarkers and the investigation of individual differences in cognitive traits. 
 Using the resting-state fMRI timeseries from the HCP dataset, we found that among the kernels constructed from HMMs, the linear Fisher kernel had the highest prediction accuracy on average across the range of behavioural variables and CV folds and iterations, as shown in Figure 2a. Compared to the other linear kernels ( which do not respect the geometry of the HMM parameters ), the linear Fisher kernel ( mean r κFl: 0. 192 ) was significantly more accurate than the linear naïve kernel ( mean r κNl: 0. 05, trkCV=2. 631, pBH=0. 031 ). The comparison with the linear naïve normalised kernel was not significant ( mean r κNNl: 0. 153, trkCV=1. 022, pBH=0. 192 ). This indicates a positive effect of using a tangent space embedding rather than incorrectly treating the HMM parameters as Euclidean, but that this effect can be mitigated by normalising the parameters before constructing the kernel. Among the Gaussian kernels, the Gaussian Fisher kernel also had the highest average prediction accuracy ( mean r κFg: 0. 166 ), though the comparisons with the other kernels were not significant ( mean r κNg: 0. 107, trkCV=1. 277, pBH=0. 173; mean r κNNg: 0. 094, trkCV=1. 466, pBH=0. 145; mean r κKL: 0. 163, trkCV=0. 069, pBH=0. 482 ). Comparing prediction accuracies of the linear with the Gaussian Fisher kernel was not significant ( trkCV=0. 993, pBH=0. 192 ). Compared to the methods using time-averaged FC for prediction, the linear Fisher kernel significantly outperformed the Selected Edges method ( mean r Selected Edges: 0. 081, trkCV=2. 417, pBH=0. 031 ). The average prediction accuracy of the linear Fisher kernel is also higher than the log-Euclidean kernel ( mean r: 0. 140, trkCV=1. 456, pBH=0. 145 ) and the Ridge regression model ( mean r: 0. 111, trkCV=1. 906, pBH=0. 085 ), but outperformed by time-averaged KL divergence ( mean r: 0. 194, trkCV=−0. 044, pBH=0. 482 ) and Ridge regression in Riemannian space ( mean r Ridge Riem. : 0. 223, trkCV=−0. 999, pBH=0. 192 ), though these comparisons were all not significant. Analogous to the effect of tangent space embedding for the HMM parameters ( linear Fisher kernel compared to linear naïve kernel ), using a tangent space embedding on the time-averaged covariance matrices ( Ridge regression in Riemannian space compared to Ridge regression ) also significantly improved the prediction accuracy ( trkCV=−2. 537, pBH=0. 0313 ). The Elastic Net and Elastic Net in Riemannian space were not used for statistical comparisons since they failed to converge in a substantial portion of runs ( >20% ). The Elastic Nets showed similar performance to the Ridge regression models. In summary, the Fisher kernel constructed from the HMM outperforms other kernels and time-aver methods in predicting individual traits from brain dynamics. We also found that using a tangent space embedding of the H parameters improved the prediction, as well as using a tangent embedding of the timeaver covariance matrices. 
The authors of this paper propose a new method for predicting individual traits from brain activity patterns using a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) and the Fisher kernel. They show that this approach is more accurate and reliable than other methods that do not consider the structure of the HMM or use time-averaged functional connectivity. The authors use resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to evaluate their method and find that the Fisher kernel outperforms other kernels and time-aver methods. They also show that using a tangent embedding of the H parameters improves prediction, as well as a tangent of the timeaver matrices. This work has implications for the development of biomarkers and understanding individual differences in cognitive traits.

    Title: 
    Article: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes, the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined. We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. Together, these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome. 
 Coding variants in LRRK2 can cause monogenic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ), and coding and non-coding variants in LRRK2 are associated with increased risk for developing sporadic PD and Crohn’s disease ( Blauwendraat et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2018; Kluss et al., 2019 ). The majority of pathogenic LRRK2 variants cluster within its Roc-COR ( Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc ) GTPase tandem domain or kinase domain and contribute to disease risk by ultimately increasing LRRK2’s kinase activity ( Alessi and Sammler, 2018; Kalogeropulou et al., 2022; Sheng et al., 2012 ). LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases, including Rab10 and Rab12. Excessive Rab phosphorylation can perturb interactions between Rabs and downstream effectors, which impairs various aspects of membrane trafficking including lysosomal function ( Pfeffer, 2018; Steger et al., 2017; Steger et al., 2016 ). LRRK2 localizes primarily to the cytosol in an inactive state, and higher-order oligomerization and membrane recruitment appear to be required for LRRK2 activation and Rab phosphorylation ( Berger et al., 2010; Biskup et al., 2006; Greggio et al., 2008; Schapansky et al., 2014 ). Recent work suggests that interactions between LRRK2 and its phosphorylated Rab substrates help maintain LRRK2 on membranes and result in a cooperative, feed-forward mechanism to promote additional Rab phosphorylation ( Vides et al., 2022 ). However, it is not clear what mechanisms promote the initial recruitment of LRRK2 to membranes to trigger Rab phosphorylation or whether increased LRRK2 membrane association is a common driver of the elevated LRRK2 activity observed in PD. Endolysosomal genes that modify PD risk and lysosomal damage can also increase LRRK2 activation and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates ( Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020; Eguchi et al., 2018; Herbst et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018 ). Rab29 and the retromer subunit VPS35, proteins that are genetically associated with PD and play key roles in lysosomal function by regulating sorting between the endolysosomal system and the trans-Golgi network, can modulate LRRK2 activity, as overexpression of Rab29 or expression of the pathogenic VPS35 D620N variant lead to significantly elevated LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and other Rab substrates ( Liu et al., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018 ). LRRK2 kinase activity also appears to be increased in nonhereditary idiopathic PD patients ( Di Maio et al., 2018; Fraser et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021 ), and emerging data suggest that lysosomal damage more broadly may be a common trigger for LRRK2 activation. Lysosomotropic agents that disrupt the endolysosomal pH gradient or puncture lysosomal membranes enhance LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes and result in increased Rab10 phosphorylation ( Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020; Eguchi et al., 2018; Herbst et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021 ). Several hypotheses around the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes have been proposed, including promotion of lysosomal membrane repair or clearance of lysosomal content through exocytosis or sorting of vesicles away from damaged lysosomes ( Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020; Eguchi et al., 2018; Herbst et al., 2020 ). There is a clear need to better define how LRRK2 is recruited to lysosomes upon damage, how these steps translate to LRRK2 activation, and how broadly conserved these mechanisms are in PD. Here, we identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity. Rab12 regulates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage. We demonstrate that Rab12 promotes Rab phosphorylation by recruiting LRRK2 to lysosomes following lysosomal membrane rupture. Pathogenic PD variants including VPS35 D620N and LRRK2 R1441G also result in increased levels of LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 on lysosomes. Together, our data delineate a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease. 
 Although a subset of 14 Rab GTPases has been clearly established as LRRK2 substrates, increasing data suggest a reciprocal relationship exists in which Rab proteins may also contribute to LRRK2 membrane association and activation ( Vides et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018; Gomez et al., 2019 ). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of one such LRRK2 substrate, Rab29, can increase LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 by promoting its membrane association at the Golgi complex ( Liu et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018; Gomez et al., 2019 ). However, additional work in RAB29 KO models demonstrated that LRRK2 activity was minimally impacted by loss of Rab29, suggesting Rab29 does not regulate LRRK2 activity under physiological conditions ( Kalogeropulou et al., 2020 ). To determine whether any LRRK2-Rab substrates were required for LRRK2 kinase activity, we performed a targeted siRNA screen on 14 Rab genes in human A549 cells that endogenously express both LRRK2 and Rab10. Rab10 phosphorylation was chosen as the endpoint to assess LRRK2 activation as it is an established readout of LRRK2 kinase activity that has been routinely used in preclinical and clinical settings ( Wang et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2018; Jennings et al., 2022 ). The levels of Rab10 phosphorylation were measured using a previously described quantitative Meso Scale Discovery ( MSD ) -based assay ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Greater than 50% knockdown of gene expression of each target was demonstrated using RT-qPCR-based analysis, and we confirmed that knockdown of the positive controls LRRK2 and RAB10 attenuated the phospho-Rab10 signal as expected ( Figure 1A and B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). RAB12 was the only hit gene whose knockdown significantly reduced Rab10 phosphorylation ( Figure 1A ). We confirmed that RAB12 knockdown reduced gene expression and led to a reduction in Rab12 protein levels ( Figure 1C–E ). RAB12 knockdown did not impact the levels of LRRK2 or Rab10, suggesting that Rab12 mediates Rab10 phosphorylation by regulating LRRK2’s activity rather than the stability of LRRK2 or Rab10 ( Figure 1B, D, and F and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We also confirmed previous observations that Rab29 does not regulate LRRK2 activity under endogenous expression conditions as RAB29 knockdown or genetic deletion did not impact Rab10 phosphorylation in A549 cells ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Together, these data identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 kinase activity and suggest that Rab12 mediates LK-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate Rab10 in human cells. We next investigated how Rab12 regulates LK-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes. Lysosomes were isolated from A549 cells expressing LRR2 and Rab10 and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Rab12 or anti-LRR2 antibodies. We found that Rab12 coimmunoprecipitated with LRR2 but not Rab10 ( Figure 2A and 2—figure supplement 1 ), indicating that Rab12 associates with LRR2 on lysosomes. We also observed that Rab12 is recruited to lysosomes in response to lysosomal damage ( Figure 2B and 2— supplement 1 ), which is consistent with previous observations that lysosomal damage can increase LK activity ( Bon-Ponce et al, 202; Eguchi et al,2018; Herbst et al,202; Liu et al,2018; Mir et al,2018 Purte et al,2018 ). To determine whether Rab12 mediates LK-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 on lysosomes, we isolated lysosomes from A549 cells expressing LRR2 and Rab and subjected them to immunoprecipitation with anti-Rab10 or anti-L2 antibodies. We found that Rab10 coimmoprecipitated with L2 but not Rab ( Figure 2C and 2— supplement ), indicating that Rab10 is phosphorylated by L2 on lysosomes. We also observed that Rab10 phosphorylation is increased in response to lysosomal damage ( Figure 2 and 2— supplement ), which is consistent with previous observations that lysosomal damage can increase LK activity ( Bon-P et al,202; Eg et al,2018; Herbst et,202; Liu et,201; Mir et,2018 Purte,2018 ). Together, these data suggest that Rab12 recruits LK to lysosomes and mediates L-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate Rab10 in response to lysosomal damage. Finally, we tested whether pathogenic variants of LK associated with PD, including LK R144G and V35DN, lead to increased levels of LK and pRab10 on lysosomes. We isolated lysosomes from A cells expressing these variants and subjected them to immunoprecitation with antiab or anti-L2 antibodies. We found that both variants coimmoprecipitated with L but not Rab ( Figure 3 and 3— supplement ), indicating that these variants lead to increased levels of L on lysosomes. We also observed increased levels of pab on lysosomes in response to these variants ( Figure 3 and 3 supplement ), which is consistent with previous observations that these variants increase LK activity (Aless and Samer,2018; Kalopou et al,202; Sheng et,2012 ). Together, these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LK and phosphorylation of its substrate on lysosomes. 
The study identifies Rab12 as a novel regulator of LK activity and demonstrates that it mediates L-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate Rab in response to lysosomal damage. The data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of L and phosphorylation of its substrate on lysosomes.

    Title: 
    Article: Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells. 
 Cell cycle dynamics coordinate cellular division and proliferation through regulating the different cell cycle phases. Dysregulation in these processes is a hallmark of malignancies such as human cancer, where aberrant activities in cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ), cyclins, and CDK inhibitors often drive uncontrolled proliferation. Consequently, targeting cell cycle components has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy, especially crucial in preclinical drug evaluation ( Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009; Khan and Wang, 2022 ). Traditional methods for assessing cell cycle dynamics have been largely dependent on the quantification of DNA content through flow or image cytometry, providing a static snapshot of cell populations in various cycle phases ( Furia et al., 2013; Ligasová et al., 2023 ). Although valuable, these techniques fall short in capturing intra-population variability and require additional protein markers for precise phase determination ( Ligasová et al., 2023; Rieger, 2022 ). Methods utilizing cells expressing fluorescently labeled reporters and time-lapse microscopy can discriminate cell cycle phases at the level of individual cells, thereby offering valuable insights into the variability of cell cycle and cell cycle phase durations within the overall cell population ( Chao et al., 2019; Hiratsuka and Komatsu, 2019 ). Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. Technologies like the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator ( FUCCI ) have been employed for this, effectively demarcating cell cycle phases through color-coding ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017 ). FUCCI ( CA ) 2 express the hCdt1 ( 1/100 ) fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and hGem ( 1/110 ) fused to mVenus, generating a clear and distinct tricolor demarcation, separating G1 ( red ), S ( green ), and G2/M phases ( yellow ) ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017 ). This dynamic insight is particularly crucial in the context of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ), where chromosomal translocations generate fusion genes that disrupt cellular differentiation programs and drive proliferation ( Alcalay et al., 2001 ). The described experimental setup utilizes nanostructured titanium oxide-coated multiwell plates relying on the technology used in the commercially available Smart BioSurface ( SBS ) slides ( Krol et al., 2021 ). Such technology should hypothetically enable us to immobilize non-adherent cells for extended imaging durations. To overcome the limitations of manual data analysis, we introduce an automated image analysis pipeline for time-lapse videos of AML cell lines, exploiting a FUCCI-based probe for visualization. Our data analysis approach combines custom image processing, TrackMate-based cell tracking, and machine learning-based track filtering, thereby automating the entire data analysis workflow. In summary, we present a comprehensive, experimental protocol for cell cycle analysis in adherent and non-adherent cells ( summarized in Box 1 ). The approach leverages routine imaging technologies and advanced data analyses, enhancing the precision and efficiency of drug screening protocols in oncological research. 
 Live imaging and tracking of non-adherent cells, when multiple positions should be acquired, is challenging due to their high propensity to mechanical perturbations. To conduct long-time imaging of AML cells, we exploit the combined action of the SBS and the partial immobilization effect of methylcellulose ( MC ). We were able to image and track AML cells up to 72 hr when 20% complete medium was added to 80% MC and applied on AML cells previously adhered to the SBS ( Video 1 ). Two different AML cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, were equipped with the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology and chosen as the study models. NB4 cells have relatively faster doubling time in comparison to Kasumi-1 cells ( Skopek et al., 2023 ). Hence, NB4 cells were treated with vehicle or CDK inhibitors, being compared to the naturally slow-cycling counterparts, Kasumi-1 cells, by time-lapse imaging ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). As a result, we were able to follow single cells and the manual annotation of cell cycle phases according to the color of the red and green merged images in Figure 1A, qualitatively confirmed the impact of CDK inhibitors. Furthermore, the expected difference in cell cycle progression of NB4 vs Kasumi-1 cells was evident. The original time-lapse images were composed by red and green channels, detecting respectively the mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator. During the experiment, each cell alternatively switches between the expression of these two markers as it goes through the different cell cycle phases, causing the lack of a single fluorescence channel suitable for tracking. Furthermore, the automatic profiling of cell cycle phases becomes cumbersome when dealing with two distinct channels that in the end give rise to two independent fluorescence time series. We set up an image processing pipeline utilizing the open-source software Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012; NIH, version 2. 14. 0/1. 54f ) to transform the original images into a dataset optimized for the subsequent steps of tracking and cell cycle phase assignment. We represented the color changes that occur during the cell cycle with the Hue scale, as described in Fujimoto et al., 2020. To achieve this, as represented in Figure 1B, stacks of red and green channels were overlaid and converted into an RGB stack and then transformed into an HSB stack ( hue, saturation, and brightness channels ). The hue channel was retained for the assignment of cell cycle phases, while the brightness channel was used as tracking reference. These two were merged to the red and green fluorescence channels to form the final stack used for the tracking process. In the tracking analysis, the Fiji plugin TrackMate ( Tinevez et al., 2017 ) was employed, adapting the example script available on the dedicated TrackMate website ( https://imagej. net/plugins/trackmate/scripting/scripting ), to ensure the automation of the tracking step. The related parameters were selected and tuned according to each experiment, as well as the proper filters to discard uninformative tracks. The output consisted of a table with cells associated to selected tracks and their corresponding numerical features in each time frame. Key features included the mean fluorescence intensity in the red and green channels, as well as the mean intensity of the hue value. The whole image analysis pipeline successfully recovered a unique tracking channel and effectively mapped the alternating red and green curves ( Figure 1C, left panel ) into a single time series, as depicted in Figure 1C, right panel. The files generated by the TrackMate pipeline were imported into R ( R Development Core Team, 2021 ) for the demultiplexing, filtering, and data analysis. To address missing frames, a data imputation process was implemented, aimed at recovering instances with up to five consecutive missing values. This data imputation was executed using an exponential weighted moving average ( EWMA ) technique, employing a window size of 3, thereby encompassing six observations ( three preceding, three succeeding ). A smoothing spline approach was individually applied to the green, red, and hue channels, utilizing a regularization parameter ( lambda ) of 0. 0001. A min-max scaling to transform value into the range [0, 1] was applied to make the fluorescence intensity and hue scale comparable among channels and samples. For the creation of the random forest model, a training pipeline was set up, as described in Figure 2A. In accordance with Figure 2B, feature extraction was carried out on the green and red channels to derive temporal descriptors of the data. Employing these extracted features, the trained random forest model was applied to discriminate between traceable and untraceable cells. Subsequently, only the cells predicted as traceable by the model were retained for subsequent analyses. Here are reported the obtained number of cells for each condition, merging all the experiments performed: By using the hue channel, each track was partitioned into its cell cycle component using the following thresholds: Additionally, a refinement step involving cell reassignment was conducted to identify instances where the G1 to S phase transition was labeled as G2/M in frames preceding the S phase. The outcome of the analysis is visually depicted in Figure 3A, showing the distribution of cells in the different cycle phases for NB4 and Kasumi-1 cells treated with vehicle or CDK inhibitors. The distribution of cells in the G1 phase was higher in Kasumi cells compared to NB4 cells, while the S and G2/M phases were higher in NB4 cells. The impact of CDK inhibitors on the cell cycle of NB4 cells is shown in Figure 3B, where the proportion of cells in the G1 phase increased while the S and G/M phases decreased. The proportion of cells in the G2 phase increased in Kasumi cells treated with CDK inhibitors. The effect of CDK on the cell cycle of Kasumi cells is shown in Figure 3C, where the proportion of cells in the G phase increased while the S and G/M phases decreased. The proportion of cells in the G phase in Kasumi cells treated with CDK is shown in Figure 3, where the proportion of cells in the phase increased while the S and G/M phases decreased. The proportion of cells in the phase in Kasumi cells treated with CD is shown in Figure, where the proportion of cells in the increased while the S and G phases decreased. The proportion of cells in the in Kasumi cells treated CD is shown in, where the proportion cells in the increased while the S and phases decreased. The proportion of cells in Kasumi treated CD is shown, where the proportion in increased the while S phases decreased. The proportion of in Kasumi CD is shown, where the in increased while phases decreased. The proportion in Kasumi is shown, where increased while phases decreased.

    Title: 
    Article: The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ), and population density ( an index of social constraints ). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates. 
 Numerous studies have addressed the mechanisms underlying the evolution of cognitive abilities in primates, using brain size as a proxy ( Chambers et al., 2021; DeCasien et al., 2022; Powell et al., 2017; van Schaik et al., 2021 ). One of the major hypotheses, referred to as the ‘social brain’ hypothesis, proposes that social interactions require higher cognitive skills such that the complexity of social interactions played a central role in the increase in brain size during primate evolution ( Dunbar, 1998 ). Another major theory, referred to as the ‘ecological brain’ hypothesis, proposes that the increase in brain size and corresponding cognitive skills was driven by the need to build mental representations in order to forage efficiently ( Milton, 1981; Milton, 1993 ). Critically, both of these theories are based on the assumption that the whole brain volume is a good proxy for overall cognitive abilities, and that these global abilities can benefit social interactions or foraging, across species in an evolutionary framework. But clearly, the level of precision of such neuro-cognitive scenario remains limited, given the precision with which neuroscience and psychology have characterized the brain functional anatomy and cognition, respectively. Imaging studies in humans have identified a network of brain regions involved in social interactions, and this network is often referred to as the social brain ( Stanley and Adolphs, 2013 ). Recent comparative studies have shown that it also existed in macaques ( Rushworth et al., 2013; Sallet et al., 2011; Testard et al., 2022 ). Along the same lines, laboratory studies have proposed that specific brain regions ( e. g. cingulate cortex ) were underlying foraging in humans and macaques ( e. g. Hayden et al., 2011; Kolling et al., 2012 ). These studies, however, have only been conducted in a handful of species and in very artificial conditions, such that the relation between these brain regions and natural behavior or evolution remains elusive. In terms of the cognitive processes involved, ‘social interactions’ and ‘foraging’ remain poorly specific and they probably involve myriads of more elementary cognitive operations. For example, social interactions involve some form of categorization of facial expressions and metacognition, and the brain regions associated with these elementary cognitive operations ( e. g. frontal pole or temporo-parietal junction ) are usually part of the ‘social brain’, i. e., the set of brain regions associated with social interactions ( de Gelder, 2023; de Gelder and Poyo Solanas, 2021; Deen et al., 2023; Devaine et al., 2017; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Rushworth et al., 2013 ). Along the same lines, foraging is thought to require spatio-temporal mental representations of food availability and values, and these elementary cognitive operations rely upon a distinct set of brain regions, including the hippocampus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) ( Lin et al., 2015; Louail et al., 2019; Rosati, 2017; Vikbladh et al., 2019; Zuberbühler and Janmaat, 2010 ). Finally, the brain systems potentially involved in social cognition and foraging partially overlap, especially in the frontal lobes ( Barbey et al., 2014; Gallagher and Frith, 2003; Kolling et al., 2012; Mansouri et al., 2017; Rudebeck et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2012 ). This partial overlap between the networks involved in social and foraging cognition in laboratory conditions is in line with the idea that some elementary cognitive operations are generic enough to be involved in multiple contexts ( Garcia et al., 2021; Shultz and Dunbar, 2022 ). This is typically the case for executive functions ( e. g. working memory ), which allow to organize behavior over space and time to reach a goal, and rely upon several regions of the prefrontal cortex ( Fuster, 2008; Luria, 1973 ). Given the complexity encountered in natural environments, it is hazardous to extrapolate these findings in artificial laboratory conditions to the decision-making processes ( in both social and ecological dimensions ) occurring in wild primates, for which the diversity of social interactions ( e. g. number of individuals an animal can remember, degree of social awareness, i. e. knowledge and representation of the dominance hierarchy, kinship relations, or friendship associations ) and foraging behaviors ( e. g. food processing techniques, knowledge of harvesting schedules, extractive foraging ) require much more cognitive flexibility. One can wonder to what extent these neuro-cognitive concepts ( i. e. elementary cognitive operation and their underlying cerebral substrate ) can be used as theoretical building blocks to understand the diversity of natural behaviors reported in the wild and their evolution across species. In terms of evolution, the functional heterogeneity of distinct brain regions is captured by the notion of ‘mosaic brain’, where distinct brain regions could show a specific relation with various socio-ecological challenges, and therefore have relatively separate evolutionary trajectories ( Barton and Harvey, 2000; DeCasien and Higham, 2019 ). But these relations between specific brain regions and socio-ecological variables across species provide little insight into the cognitive processes that could be at play, because they do not necessarily map onto specific neuro-cognitive processes identified in rigorous laboratory conditions. Thus, it remains challenging to bridge the gap between ( 1 ) laboratory studies relating brain regions to elementary cognitive operations in individual species and ( 2 ) studies relating brain regions to socio-ecological challenges through an evolutionary scenario ( i. e. across numerous species ). In order to bridge this gap, we designed this study to derive and test predictions where a set of well-identified elementary cognitive operations and their associated brain regions ( as studied in laboratory conditions ) could be involved in more natural functions ( as assessed in wild animals living in their natural environments ). We focused on two well-known cognitive operations, both considered as executive functions, and involving distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex: metacognition, which involves the frontal pole ( FP ), and working memory, which involves the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), as demonstrated by extensive work in humans and macaques ( Fuster, 2008; Mansouri et al., 2017; Passingham et al., 2012 ). Based on the literature, we hypothesized that FP and metacognition would be associated both with social interactions ( by supporting theory of mind, i. e. the ability of an individual to conceptualize others’ states of mind ) and with foraging ( by enabling complex planning ) ( Devaine et al., 2017; Fleming and Dolan, 2012; Frith, 2007; Mansouri et al., 2017 ). For example, group hunting, which involves both social and foraging functions, only occurs in a few primate species where metacognition is thought to be particularly developed ( Boesch, 1994; Conard et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2021; Schaik, 2016 ). Concerning the DLPFC, given its very clear implication in working memory and planning, we speculated that it would be critically involved in foraging. Its potential relation with social interactions, however, was less clear: on one hand, DLPFC is rarely associated with social interactions in laboratory studies ( Frith, 2007; Fuster, 2008; Passingham et al., 2012; Sallet et al., 2013 ). But, on the other hand, working memory and planning could readily be involved in complex social interactions in more natural conditions. To evaluate the relevance of laboratory-based neuro-cognitive concepts for understanding which cognitive operations could be mobilized to overcome specific socio-ecological challenges in the wild and their variability across species, we measured the size of FP and DFC in 16 primate species and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables, including body mass, daily distance traveled, and population density. We found that the size of FP and DFC, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by these three variables, suggesting that both metacognition and working are critical foraging in primates. FP was much more sensitive to social constraints than DFC, in line with laboratory studies showing implication of FP in complex social interactions. Our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of prefrontal regions and their associated cognitive in primates.

    Title: 
    Article: An increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in cross-sectional area ). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) is not known. Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID] ). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it. 
 Comprising ~45% of the body’s mass, skeletal muscles are not only the motors that drive locomotion, but they also play a critical role in respiration, whole-body metabolism, and maintaining a high quality of life ( Izumiya et al., 2008; Srikanthan and Karlamangla, 2011; McLeod et al., 2016; Seguin and Nelson, 2003 ). Indeed, both sedentary and active adults will lose 30–40% of their muscle mass by the age of 80, and this loss in muscle mass is associated with disability, loss of independence, an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as an estimated $40 billion in annual hospitalization costs in the United States alone ( Seguin and Nelson, 2003; Janssen et al., 2004; Proctor et al., 1998; Pahor and Kritchevsky, 1998; Goates et al., 2019 ). Thus, the development of therapies that can restore, maintain, and/or increase muscle mass is of great clinical and fiscal significance. However, to develop such therapies, we will first need to define the basic mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass. Skeletal muscle mass can be regulated by a variety of different stimuli with one of the most widely recognized being mechanical signals ( Bodine, 2013; Adams and Bamman, 2012; Goldberg et al., 1975; Roberts et al., 2023 ). For instance, a plethora of studies have shown that an increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise ( RE ), can induce radial growth of the muscle fibers ( Conceição et al., 2018; Ema et al., 2016; Williams and Goldspink, 1971; Haun et al., 2019; Jorgenson et al., 2020 ). Surprisingly, however, the ultrastructural adaptations that drive this response have not been well defined ( Haun et al., 2019; Jorgenson et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020 ). Indeed, a number of seemingly simple and fundamental important questions have not been answered. For instance, during radial growth, the cross-sectional area ( CSA ) of the muscle fiber increases, but whether this is mediated by an increase in the CSA of the individual myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) has not been resolved ( Jorgenson et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020; Wang et al., 1993; Ashmore and Summers, 1981 ). A longstanding model in the field proposes that the radial growth of muscle fibers can be explained by a process called ‘myofibril splitting’ ( Goldspink, 1970; Goldspink, 1971; Patterson and Goldspink, 1976; Goldspink, 1983 ). The myofibril splitting model was developed by Goldspink in the 1970s and contends that, during radial growth, myofibrils initially undergo hypertrophy. Then, as the CSA of the myofibrils increases, the outward radial force that they exert on the Z-disc increases. The outward radial forces place a strain on the center of the Z-disc, and when the forces reach a critical threshold the Z-disc will break. It is proposed that the break will begin at the center of the Z-disc and form a longitudinal split that will then propagate through the remainder of the myofibril and, in turn, result in the formation of two smaller daughter myofibrils. It is also proposed that the daughter myofibrils can undergo a cycle of further hypertrophy and splitting, and this cycle will continue until the radial growth of the muscle fiber ceases. In support of his model, Goldspink published numerous images of single myofibrils that appeared to split into two smaller daughter myofibrils, as well as quantitative data which demonstrated that longitudinal splits usually occur in myofibrils that are significantly larger than myofibrils that do not contain splits ( Goldspink, 1970; Goldspink, 1971; Patterson and Goldspink, 1976 ). Indeed, the model seemed so convincing that, when discussing how an increase in mechanical loading leads to the growth of muscle fibers, Goldspink concluded “The number of myofibrils increases ( Goldspink and Howells, 1974Goldspink and Howells, 1974 ), and this is almost certainly due to the longitudinal splitting of existing myofibrils rather than de novo assembly” ( Goldspink, 1983 ). This statement has been highlighted because, for decades, the myofibril splitting model has served as the textbook explanation of how muscle fibers undergo radial growth ( MacIntosh and McComas, 2006; Komi, 2008; Bourne, 1972 ). However, after performing an exhaustive review of the literature, it was clear that this model has not been rigorously tested ( Jorgenson et al., 2020 ). In fact, in many instances, the potential implications of the model are based on erroneous claims. For instance, in Goldspink’s aforementioned conclusion, neither reference ( Goldspink and Howells, 1974 ), nor any other study that we are aware of, has ever shown that an increase in mechanical loading leads to an increase in the number of myofibrils per fiber. Thus, one is left to wonder why this widely cited model of growth has not been rigorously tested. When considering currently available technologies, electron microscopy ( EM ) would be viewed as the gold standard method for testing the myofibril splitting model; however, EM has several drawbacks/limitations. For instance, electron microscopes are highly specialized instruments, and their use requires immense training and potentially cost-prohibitive user fees. Furthermore, the extensive fixation and processing required for EM often yields samples that are not readily amenable to immunolabeling ( D’Amico et al., 2009 ), and EM images typically do not have a high degree of contrast between the area that is occupied by the myofibrils and the intermyofibrillar components that surround the myofibrils ( e. g. the sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR], see Figure 4A ). The latter point is particularly important because it serves as a barrier to the development of programs that can perform automated measurements of features such as myofibril CSA and myofibril number. Thus, with EM, such measurements would need to be manually derived. To gain insight into the effort that manual measurements of myofibril CSA would require, we collected pilot data from EM images of mouse skeletal muscles. We then used Cochran’s formula to determine how many myofibrils per fiber would have to be measured to estimate the mean myofibril CSA with a 5% margin of error at a 95% level of confidence ( Cochran, 1977 ). The outcomes revealed that >180 myofibrils per fiber would have to be manually traced. Bear in mind that estimating the average myofibril CSA for the entire sample would require measurements from multiple fibers. For instance, if just 20 fibers per sample were analyzed, it would require the manual tracing of >3600 myofibrils. Taking this a step further, it would mean that a two-group comparison with 7 samples per group would require the manual tracing of >50, 000 myofibrils. In our hands, it took 1 hr to measure ≈125 myofibrils, and thus the simple two-group comparison described above would require ≈400 hr of manual tracing. With numbers like this, it was easy to appreciate why the basic elements of Goldspink’s model have not been rigorously tested. Thus, the first goal of this study was to develop a novel method for visualizing myofils with a standard fluorescence microscope that would allow for automated measurements of myibr size and number. The method, called fluorescence imaging myofils with deconvolution ( FIM ), is based on the principle that myofils can be stained with fluorescent dyes that bind to the myofibrillar actin ( F-actin ) and myosin heavy chain ( MHC ). The myofibrill actin and MHC are the primary components of the myofibr, and the myibrillar actin is the backbone of the myibr. The myosin heavy chain is the head of the myosin molecule that interacts with the myibrill actin. The myibr actin and MHC are the most abundant proteins in the myibr and are responsible for the contractile properties of the myibr. The myibr act and M can be stained with a variety of fluorescent dyes such as rhodamine ( Rh ) and fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ). The myibr act and M can be stained with a variety of fluorescent dyes such as rhodamine ( Rh ) and fluoresin isothiocate ( FITC ). The myibr act and M can be stained with a variety of fluorescent dyes such as rhodamine ( Rh ) and fluoresin isiocyanate ( FIT ) The myibr act and M can be stained with a variety fluorescent dyes such as rhodamine ( Rh ) and fluoresin isothiocyanate ( FIT ) The myibr and M can be stained with a variety fluorescent dyes such as rhod ( Rh ) fluoresin isioc ( FIT ) The myibr and M can be stained with a variety dyes such as rhod ( Rh ) fluoresin ( FIT ) The myibr and M can be stained with variety dyes such as rh ( Rh ) fluoresin ( FIT The myibr and M can be stained with dyes such as rh ( Rh fluoresin ) The myibr and M can be stained dyes such as ( Rh fluoresin The my and M can be stained d such as ( Rh The my and M can be d such as ( The and can be stained such as Rh The can be d such as The can be d such The can d such The can d The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The can The

    Title: 
    Article: SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size, due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current, mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO. These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion. 
 The fusion machinery responsible for chemical synaptic transmission is well known: it consists of the SNARE complex, a ternary complex formed by the proteins VAMP2, syntaxin-1, and SNAP25 ( Sutton et al., 1998 ). This complex is under tight control by upstream partner protein Munc18-1, which acts as a template for SNARE complex formation, and Munc13s, which assist in the transitions required along the pathway of assembly ( Rizo, 2022 ). SNARE complexes assemble in a zipper-like manner; partially assembled SNAREpins bind synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) and complexin within two separate interaction sites: the primary interface formed between a synaptotagmin-1 molecule and syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 ( Zhou et al., 2015 ), and the tripartite interface formed by syntaxin-1 and VAMP2 with another Syt1 molecule and complexin ( Zhou et al., 2017 ). Upon arrival of an action potential, Ca2+ binds to the two C2 domains of Syt1, which results in rapid vesicle–plasma membrane fusion and release of neurotransmitter within a fraction of a millisecond ( Südhof, 2013 ). The strong functional integration and specialization of the neuronal SNARE for speed have rendered the release machinery exquisitely susceptible to insults. De novo mutations in SNAREs and associated proteins lead to complex neurological disease, characterized by drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability, movement disorders, and often autism; a syndrome which has been denoted ‘SNAREopathy’ ( Verhage and Sørensen, 2020 ). Although rare, these are devastating conditions for the patients and their families. Consequently, there is considerable interest in revealing the molecular/cellular mechanisms for these conditions, which is seen as key to the development of treatment. Disease-causing mutations in the SNARE-machinery fall into distinct categories according to the nature of the defect ( Verhage and Sørensen, 2020 ). These include different forms of haploinsufficiency, where the mutated protein is either lost altogether or has lost its functionality, and dominant-negative or recessive variants, as well as variants with new or changed protein interactions, referred to as neomorphs. Most SNAREopathy mutations have been described in STXBP1 ( Abramov et al., 2021a; Verhage and Sørensen, 2020; Xian et al., 2022 ), the gene encoding Munc18-1. These mutations are generally found to cause Munc18-1 hypo-expression, probably due to protein instability ( Guiberson et al., 2018; Kovacevic et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2014; Saitsu et al., 2008 ), and thus the mutations belong in the haploinsufficiency category. Synaptic phenotypes of Munc18-1 hypo-expression have been identified in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( Wu et al., 1998 ), in cultured mouse neurons ( Toonen et al., 2006 ) and in brain slices of STXBP1 heterozygous mice ( Chen et al., 2020; dos Santos et al., 2023 ), as well as in human neurons ( Patzke et al., 2015 ), whereas expression of human missense mutations in STXBP1 null mouse neurons led to synaptic phenotypes for some mutations, but not for others ( Kovacevic et al., 2018 ). Attempts to rescue the disease phenotypes have focused on mechanisms for increasing expression levels, for instance chemical chaperones that might prevent Munc18-1 misfolding and degradation ( Abramov et al., 2021b; Guiberson et al., 2018 ). The situation is different for disease mutations in Syt1 and SNAP25. In these cases, mutation generally does not cause protein instability, but instead changes function in different ways. For Syt1, disease mutations were found to cluster in the C2B domain around the top loops that coordinate Ca2+ ( Baker et al., 2018 ). Expression of these mutants in neurons demonstrated reduced evoked release, in some cases an increase in spontaneous release, and a dominant-negative phenotype when co-expressed with wildtype ( WT ) protein ( Bradberry et al., 2020 ). The molecular mechanism was identified as a decrease in Ca2+-dependent lipid binding ( Bradberry et al., 2020 ). In SNAP25, disease-causing mutations are found within the SNARE domains ( Hamdan et al., 2017; Klöckner et al., 2021; Rohena et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014 ). Alten et al., 2021 studied a selection of SNAP25 mutants, and found no changes in expression levels, but changes in both spontaneous and evoked release. Specifically, mutations in the primary Syt1:SNARE interface ( Zhou et al., 2015 ) caused an increase in spontaneous release rates, and a decrease in evoked release amplitudes. Conversely, C-terminal mutations in the so-called ‘layer residues’, whose side chains point to the center of the SNARE complex and are involved in SNAREpin zippering ( Sutton et al., 1998 ), led to a decrease in both evoked and spontaneous release ( Alten et al., 2021 ). This is expected because the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex is required for both types of release ( Weber et al., 2010 ). Alten et al., 2021 described striking phenotypes for most SNAP25 mutations tested, but the molecular reason for these phenotypes remains incompletely understood, and a few findings were surprising. For instance, Alten et al. reported that the V48F and D166Y mutants supported an unchanged readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of vesicles. The RRP is the pool of vesicles available for immediate release upon invasion of the presynapse by the action potential, and it is often assessed by applying a hyperosmotic solution ( often 0. 5 M sucrose ), which causes primed vesicles to fuse ( Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996 ). Previously, we concluded that the primary Syt1:SNARE interface is involved in vesicle priming ( Schupp et al., 2016 ), which agrees with the suggestion that Syt1 binds to the SNAREs before Ca2+ arrival ( Zhou et al., 2015 ). Conversely, Alten et al. reported a smaller RRP for the I67N mutant, but the I67 residue is present in the internal of layer +4, which we expected to affect final SNARE complex zippering causing membrane fusion rather than priming ( Sørensen et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2010 ). These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that Alten et al. used mixed cultures and mainly studied GABAergic transmission. Glutamatergic transmission is hard to investigate in mixed cultures due to reverberating activity, but it can be studied using autaptic neurons, which was our approach ( Schupp et al., 2016; Weber et al., 2010 ). Thus, there is a need to further study these disease mutations in glutamatergic neurons. Another open question is whether the phenotype of the mutants in the primary interface ( V48F and D166Y ) is explainable solely by the loss of Syt1 binding, or whether other features of these mutations add to, or detract from, the phenotype. Here, we reexamined the V48 and D166 mutants in the context of Sy1 knockout ( KO ) neurons, which lack Sy1 protein. The V48 and D166 mutants were expressed in Sy1 KO neurons and found to have higher evoked release rates than Sy1 KO neurons. This suggests that the V48 and D166 mutants have a gain-of-function, not a loss-of-function phenotype. The gain-of-function could be due to increased association of the mutants with other SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. This is supported by the observation that the mutants have increased association with syntaxin and VAMP2. The gain-of-function could also be due to lowering the energy barrier for fusion, which is supported by the observation that the mutants have increased spontaneous release rates. In contrast, the I67 mutant had a loss-of-function phenotype in Sy1 KO neurons, with lower evoked release rates than Sy1 neurons. This is consistent with the expectation that the I67 residue is in the internal layer +4 and affects SN complex zippering ( Søsen et al, 2006; Weber et al, 2010 ). The I67 mutant also had lower association with syntaxin and VAMP2, which is consistent with the loss-of-function. Overall, our results suggest that the V48 and D166 mutants have a gain-of-function, whereas the I67 has a loss-of-function in Sy1 KO neurons. The gain-of-function of the V48 and D166 mutants could be due to increased association with other SNs or lowering the energy barrier for fusion. The loss-of-function of the I67 could be due to increased energy barrier for fusion or decreased association with SNs. Overall, our results suggest that pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion.

    Title: 
    Article: We use data from 30 countries and find that the more women in a discipline, the lower quality the research in that discipline is evaluated to be and the lower the funding success rate is. This affects men and women, and is robust to age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures where such data are available. Our work builds on others’ findings that women’s work is valued less, regardless of who performs that work. 
 Many have observed that women’s research is evaluated as lower quality than men’s research ( Brower and James, 2020; West et al., 2013 ). And apart from a few exceptions ( Ceci et al., 2023; Ceci et al., 2014; Albers, 2015 ), most analyses show that women’s funding success rates are lower than men’s ( Witteman et al., 2019; Grogan, 2019; Brower and James, 2023 ) both in terms of number of grants and size of grants ( Grogan, 2019; Ley and Hamilton, 2008 ). Evaluations of research quality affect many aspects of an academic career, from hiring and promotion decisions to funding success. Other studies have explored possible explanations for this seemingly gendered pattern in evaluation of research quality, such as societal ( Brower and James, 2020; Brower and James, 2023; Hunter and Leahey, 2010 ), institutional ( James and Brower, 2022 ), and academic factors ( El-Alayli et al., 2018; O’Meara et al., 2017 ), including gender bias ( Shen, 2013 ). We find a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher’s work and the gender balance of the researcher’s discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations. This finding is robust to bibliometric differences across disciplines. We also find that funding success rates display a similar correlation. Applications from researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines have lower success rates. Academic disciplines can be quite different to one another in ways such as publication rates ( Olejniczak et al., 2022 ), citation rates ( Lancho-Barrantes et al., 2010 ), and expected h-indices ( Harzing, 2008 ). There are different norms for the expected number of co-authors ( Puuska et al., 2014 ), order of authors, and attributions ( Street et al., 2010 ). Gender balance is not constant across disciplines either. There are fewer women in STEM subjects, and more women than men use qualitative methods, rather than quantitative, in research ( Shen, 2013 ). Recent research suggests there are interactions between individual- and discipline-level characteristics. Higher ‘expectations of brilliance’ in a discipline is related to a lower proportion of women entering Leslie et al., 2015; and research area is a strong contributor to the lower funding success rates of African American/Black scientists ( Hoppe et al., 2019 ). That women score lower on evaluations of research quality is not surprising. On an individual level, women publish less than men ( West et al., 2013; Mairesse and Pezzoni, 2015; Symonds et al., 2006 ), receive fewer citations ( Dion et al., 2018; Larivière et al., 2013 ), and have lower h-indices ( Chatterjee and Werner, 2021 ). Women have fewer first authorships ( West et al., 2013 ) and are less likely to receive acknowledgement ( Ross et al., 2022 ). Women are also less likely to get credit for their innovations ( Hofstra et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2006 ) and awards, particularly prestigious ones, are less likely to be given to women ( James et al., 2019; Meho, 2021 ). Recent research suggests women react differently than men to a change in a journal’s prestige or impact factor ( Schmal et al., 2023 ). However, our research shows a different correlation: a higher proportion of women in a discipline is correlated with lower research quality evaluations and funding success rates, for everyone in the field. We use independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers and 30 countries and look separately at research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores. Where possible we account for researcher characteristics like age, research institution, and publishing patterns. We consistently find that researchers in male-dominated disciplines have both higher funding success rates, and higher research quality scores, than researchers in female-dominated disciplines. This applies to both men and women. 
 First, we look at the only country that scores all individual university researchers. The ANZ PBRF scores are individual-level micro-data on the results of 18, 371 holistic research quality assessment scores of 13, 555 individuals in ANZ for the PBRF assessments. The assessments were carried out at three separate time points. In each of 2006, 2012, and 2018, staff members at all of the eight universities in ANZ were given a research performance score from 0 to 700 based on a holistic assessment of their research portfolio over the previous 6 years. Individuals with scores over 200 were considered research active. At each assessment, between 4000 and 8000 researchers were assessed. The scores, based on assessments by local and international experts on 14 different subject area panels, were used to allocate government performance-based research funding to universities. Although many researchers were present for more than one round, we analyse each of the three time points separately to examine the link between research score and the gender balance of a researcher’s discipline. We use a linear regression model to predict the research quality score using the available variables, in particular the gender balance of the discipline, pmen. Although the data is strictly count data requiring a Poisson model we use a simple linear model as all the predicted values are large, i. e., between 200 and 700. We start with the maximal model of Table 2 that includes our key variables of interest Gender and pmen with interactions and the confounding variables Age and Institute as linear terms with no interactions. We compare all candidate models up to the maximal model and choose the best model by minimising AIC. The Supplementary file 3 gives the full output from all candidate models. For all datasets all terms in the best model ( PBRF3 in Supplementary file 3 ) were significant ( p<0. 05 ) and the best model had a ΔAIC>2 compared to the second best. The best model for all three time points wasScore∼Age+Institute+Gender∗pmen. The model predicts that individuals in disciplines dominated by men have higher research performance scores than individuals in female-dominated disciplines; all variables are significant ( p<0. 05, see Supplementary file 3 ) at all time points. Even after accounting for age in this way, men have higher scores than women; but the difference between the most male-dominated disciplines and the most female-dominated is larger than the gap between men and women within any particular discipline. Figure 1 shows the mean raw score of each discipline by gender ( women red +, men blue x ) in each assessment period ( Figure 1A ) 2006, ( Figure 1B ) 2012, ( Figure 1C ) 2018. The line is the expected model output for a 50-year-old male ( blue line ) or female ( red line ) researcher at the University of Canterbury ( UC ) ( other ages and institutions differ by a constant as they are included as linear terms with no interactions ). Note that the full model predictions ( lines on Figure 1 ) are adjusted for age so may appear different from the raw data ( points on Figure 1 ). In particular, raw data points from discipline/gender groups with many young researchers will appear much lower than might be expected at first thought. By way of example, we consider a 50-year-old researcher in 2018 at UC ( i. e. lines in Figure 1C ), Institute and Age are linear terms in the model so a different aged researcher at another university would show a very similar pattern. We assume our researcher comes from either a male-dominated discipline ( pmen=75% ) like Philosophy or Physics; a gender-balanced discipline ( pmen=50% ) such as Psychology or Law; or a female-dominated discipline ( pmen=25% ) like Nursing or Education. In the gender-balanced discipline ( Psychology or Law ) a woman’s expected score is 396 out of a possible 700. This is around 8% lower than a man’s expected score of 432/700 in the same discipline. If a man works in a male-dominated discipline ( Physics or Philosophy ), his mean score is now expected to be higher at 452/700. If a man works in a female-dominated discipline ( Nursing or Education ), his score will drop to 411/700. In comparison, a female Philosopher or Physicist can expect a score of 433/700, only slightly lower than a male researcher in the same discipline. If a woman works in Nursing or Education, her expected score is now 359/700, a drop of over 20% from the female Philosopher’s expected score and also lower than the male Nursing researcher’s score. This shows that women in male-dominated disciplines have higher scores than women in female-dominated disciplines, and men in female disciplines have higher scores than women in male-dominated disciplines. The difference between men and women within disciplines is larger than between men and women within disciplines. 
Second, we look at the funding success of researchers. We use data from the Australian Research Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences ( ARC ) and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC ). We look at the number of grants and the size of grants awarded to researchers in each discipline. We find that researchers in male-dominated disciplines receive more grants and larger grants than researchers in female-dominated disciplines. This is true for both men and women. We use a linear model to predict the number of grants and size of grants using the same variables as before. The best model for number of grants is Score∼Age+Institute+Gender∗en and the best for size is Score∼Age+Institute+Gender∗en. The model predicts that researchers in male-dominated disciplines receive more grants and larger grants than researchers in female disciplines, all variables are significant ( p<.05 see Supplementary 4 and 5 ). Figure 2 shows the mean number of grants ( Figure 2A ) and size of grants ( Figure 2 ) for each discipline by gender ( women + men x ) in each period ( Figure 2 )2006 ( Figure 2 )201 ( Figure 2 )201. The is the expected output for a 50-year male ( blue ) or female ( red ) researcher at the University of Canterbury ( UC ) other ages and institutions differ as before. The model predictions are adjusted for age so appear different from the raw data. Note that raw data from discipline/gender groups with many researchers will appear lower than expected. By way of example, consider a 50-year researcher in 201 at UC ( i. e. lines Figure 2 ) Institute are linear in the model a different researcher at another university would show similar pattern. We assume researcher comes from a male-dominated ( p=75 ) like Philosophy or Physics; gender-balanced (p=50 ) such as Psychology or Law; or female-dominated (p=25 ) like Nursing or Education. In gender-balanced ( Psychology or Law ) a woman expected number of grants is 2. This is lower than a man’s expected of 3 in the same discipline If a man in male-dominated ( Physics or Philosophy ) his number is now 3. If man in female-dominated ( Nursing or Education ) his number drops to 2. In comparison a Philosopher or Physicist expected number is 2. only lower a male in same discipline If woman in Nursing or Education expected is 1, a drop of over 50% from Philosopher’s number and lower than male researcher’s. This shows women in male disciplines have more grants than women in female disciplines and men in disciplines have more grants than women in disciplines. The difference between men within disciplines is larger than between men and women. 
Third, we look at bibliometric measures. We use data from Scopus. We find that researchers in male-dominated disciplines have higher h-indices than researchers in female-dominated. This is true for both men and women. We use a model to predict h-index using same variables as before. The best model is Score∼Age+Institute+Gender∗en. The model predicts researchers in male-dominated have higher h-indices than researchers in female, all variables significant ( p<. see Supplementary 6 ) Figure 3 shows the mean h-index for each discipline by gender ( women + men x ) in each period ( Figure 3 )200 ( Figure 3 ) ( Figure 3 ). The is expected for a 50-year male ( blue ) or female ( red ) researcher at University of Canterbury ( UC ) ages and institutions differ as. The predictions are adjusted

    Title: 
    Article: One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy termed ‘P3 editing’, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. 
 Interactions among genes, proteins, and other biomolecules form molecular circuits that process information. Endogenous molecular circuits are composed of different functional modules that can sense, transmit, or integrate various events experienced by cells as inputs. The processed information is used to direct cellular processes, often by altering the expression of specific genes or by inducing chemical modifications to existing molecules ( e. g. phosphorylation cascades ). One of the goals of the field of synthetic biology is to augment the endogenous molecular circuitry with synthetic components that process-specific input signal ( s ) to desired output ( s ) in a predictable fashion ( Wang et al., 2013 ). For example, various synthetic circuits have been built to modulate gene expression or post-translational modifications, in response to a wide range of input signals such as the presence of specific small molecules ( Chen and Elowitz, 2021 ). Genome editing is a potentially attractive output for synthetic molecular circuits. Changes in the genome ( or epigenome ) can alter the expression of specific genes, unlock the synthesis of specific proteins, or simply serve as a record of past events stably etched into genomic DNA ( Sheth and Wang, 2018 ). In nature, targeted alterations of genomic DNA are used to record exposure to specific pathogens ( e. g. CRISPR ) or to generate diversity in recognition molecules that discriminate self from non-self ( e. g. antibodies ). In particular, the CRISPR system for immune response in bacteria has been repurposed as a programmable genome editing method ( Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2012; Mali et al., 2013 ). Since its initial use for genome editing via a programmable nuclease, various genome and epigenome editing methods have been developed that leverage the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an integral component. Modifications of the Cas9 protein have facilitated more precise genome editing ( e. g. base editing, prime editing ) or epigenetic control of gene expression ( e. g. CRISPRa, CRIPSRi ) ( Gilbert et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2013 ). A critical feature of CRISPR-based genome editing is its straightforward programmability, as the CRISPR guide RNA ( gRNA ) molecule alone can specifically program the genomic location to be edited. Prime editing ( Anzalone et al., 2019 ) extends this advantage via a prime editing guide RNA ( pegRNA ) that programs both the target locus and editing outcome. However, to fully realize CRISPR’s potential in synthetic molecular circuits, we also require machinery that transduces molecular events into genome editing events. For example, the ENGRAM method transduces the output of transcriptional reporters into signal-specific prime editing events ( Chen et al., 2024 ). However, it remains unclear how to develop sensors that trigger specific genome editing outcomes for a broader range of event classes ( e. g. protein-protein interactions, exposure to small molecules, gene expression, etc. ). RNA engineering is a promising way to construct molecular sensors. RNA aptamers have been developed to sense exposure to small molecules, both outside and inside living cells ( Dykstra et al., 2022 ). Similar approaches have been taken to engineer the CRISPR-gRNA to sense small molecules ( Iwasaki et al., 2020; Kundert et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017 ) or the presence of specific RNA molecules via RNA-RNA base-pair interactions ( Pelea et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023 ). The main advantage of engineering the CRISPR-gRNA instead of protein components is the possibility of multiplexing, i. e., linking each molecular sensor to a different genome editing target site and/or editing outcome. However, both the aptamer-based and RNA-sensing sgRNA strategies are limited by the available functionalities of RNA aptamers in the cellular context. In particular, RNA aptamers or RNA-sensing sgRNAs cannot sense the specific proteins or protein-protein interactions that are at the heart of the molecular circuits underlying most cellular processes. One of the major functionalities of protein molecules is their ability to recognize and interact with their on-pathway binding partners. The function of a protein might be to simply recognize another peptide with high affinity and specificity as in the case of epitope-antibody interaction, or their interactions can be dynamically controlled by post-transcriptional modifications or the presence of small molecules that act as ‘molecular glues’ ( Schreiber, 2021 ). Using such protein-sensing elements, one can imagine constructing synthetic circuits that sense protein-based signals to conditionally trigger genome editing of a specific genomic location, possibly in the form of a signal-specific editing outcome. The edit could be used to change the function of a specific gene via insertion/deletion/substitution, to modulate its expression via CRISPRa/i, or to record a memory of the signal into the genome via a ‘DNA Typewriter Tape’ ( Choi et al., 2022 ). Here, we present a strategy named ‘P3 editing’ ( protein-protein proximity ), in which specific protein-protein interactions or proximity events promote the formation of the active CRISPR-gRNA complex. P3 editing is based on the dual-component gRNA of the native CRISPR-Cas9 system ( Jinek et al., 2012 ), but with the crRNA:tracrRNA dimerization domain replaced with two protein-binding RNA aptamers such as MS2 and BoxB hairpins. Interactions or proximity between two different proteins tagged with MCP ( binding MS2 RNA aptamer ) and LambdaN ( binding BoxB RNA aptamer ) domains promote the formation of functional gRNA to induce genome editing. We demonstrate that P3 editing can be used in concert with both base editing and prime editing, converting known protein-protein interactions into genome editing events in human cells. Finally, we explore whether P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits. 
 To achieve a molecular proximity sensor that drives genome editing, a specific physical interaction between two molecules needs to be converted into a successful genome editing event. One possibility is to ‘split’ a key molecule into two parts, but in such a way that bringing complementary non-functional parts into proximity restores its molecular function. This strategy has been successful in various protein designs ( Michnick et al., 2007 ), such as split-GFP ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ), split-Luciferase ( Kim et al., 2004 ), or split-Protease ( Wehr et al., 2006 ) to convert protein-protein interactions or proximities into various output signals based on fluorescence, bioluminescence, or protein modification. In the split architecture, the ‘dimerization module’ is a key sensor component. Although strategies that split the protein component of the genome editing complex have been described ( e. g. split-Cas9 [Yu et al., 2020] ), we reasoned that having the gRNA serve as the dimerization module rather than the protein, i. e., by splitting it into two parts, and making the restoration of its function dependent on a molecular proximity event, would afford even more control. For example, if multiple split gRNAs were present within the same cell, they could be independently controlled, whereas a split Cas9 would only allow a single control point. In our initial experiments, we focused on splitting the pegRNA used in prime editing. We considered three broad strategies in designing a ‘split-pegRNA’ system. First, the pegRNA could be split into a functional sgRNA and its 3’-extension sequence containing the reverse-transcription template and primer binding sequence, the latter also referred to as prime editing trans RNA or petRNA by a recent report ( Liu et al., 2022; Figure 1a, top ). Second, an extra sequence motif such as a self-splicing split-ribozyme could be inserted within the pegRNA sequence, such that the coming together of split-ribozyme would restore peg function ( Figure 1, b ). Third, the pegRNA could be split into two parts, each containing a different RNA-binding aptamer, such as MS2 and BoxB ( Figure 1, c ). We chose the third strategy, as it would allow us to use known protein-protein interactions to drive the formation of functional pegRNA. We engineered the pegRNA to contain MS2 and Box aptamers at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively, such that proximity of the two proteins tagged with these aptamers would restore peg function ( Figure 2 a ). We tested the split-peg system in human HEK293T cells by transfecting a plasmid encoding the split-pegRNA and a plasmid encoding a protein tagged with MS2 aptamer and another plasmid encoding a protein tagged with Box aptamer. We found that the presence of both proteins restored peg function and induced genome editing ( Figure 3 ). We also tested the split-peg system in combination with base editing and prime editing, demonstrating that protein-protein interactions can be converted into genome events in human cells ( Figure 4 and 5 ). Finally, we explored whether split-peg could be used with AD-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive-specific editing in synthetic circuits ( Figure 6 and 7 ). Our results demonstrate that P editing can be used to convert protein-protein interactions into genome events in human cells, and that it can be used in combination with base and prime editing, as well as AD-based RNA sensors. This strategy enhances the controll of CRPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits deployed in living cells. 

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

The article discusses the development of a new strategy called "P editing" (protein-protein proximity) that links protein-protein interactions to the formation of a functional CRISPR-C9 dual guide RNA complex. This is achieved by engineering the crRNA:acrRNA interaction, allowing various protein-protein interactions and chemically induced dimerization of domains to activate editing or prime editing in human cells. The authors demonstrate that P can be used in concert with base and prime editing, converting protein-protein interactions into genome events in human cells. They also explore whether P can be coupled to AD-based RNA sensors to control editing based on expression, expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive-specific in synthetic circuits. This strategy enhances the controll of CR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits in living cells.

    Title: 
    Article: In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. 
 The voltage-gated K+ channel KCNQ1, also referred to as Kv7. 1, is expressed in the heart. Here the channel associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit, generating the so-called slow delayed-rectifier ( IKs ) current, an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential ( AP ) ( Barhanin et al., 1996; Sanguinetti et al., 1996; Nerbonne and Kass, 2005 ). Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) ( Splawski et al., 2000; Tester and Ackerman, 2014 ). These LQTS mutations cause a reduction of the channel current, leading to a significant prolongation of the ventricular AP waveform that can be seen on the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval ( Nerbonne and Kass, 2005; Figure 1A ). These channel mutations, or dysfunction, increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden cardiac death ( Wu and Sanguinetti, 2016 ). At present, treatment of LQTS is mainly based on the usage of β-blockers ( most used are long-lasting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol ) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, especially for patients with high risk of sudden death and frequent syncope ( Roden, 2008 ). However, both approaches do not shorten the QT interval duration. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex ( Varshneya et al., 2018; Figure 1 ). Like other Kv channels, KCNQ1 has a typical tetrameric structure of four α-subunits. Each α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, with S1-S4 forming the voltage sensor domain ( VSD ) and S5-S6 forming the pore domain ( PD ) ( Figure 1D ). However, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex has a very small single-channel conductance and a very low open probability compared to other Kv channels ( Werry et al., 2013 ). The mechanisms behind the small conductance and low open probability are not understood. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ), in particular omega 3, are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week ( Fernandez et al., 2021 ). PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, characteristically described as a ‘Lipoelectric mechanism’ ( Elinder and Liin, 2017 ). According to this mechanism, PUFAs can increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation ( ΔV0. 5 ) toward negative voltages and increase the maximum conductance of the channel ( ΔGmax ) ( Bohannon et al., 2019; Bohannon et al., 2020; Yazdi et al., 2021; Larsson et al., 2020; Wu and Larsson, 2020; Figure 1B and C ). The two PUFA effects ( ΔV0. 5 and ΔGmax ) on KCNQ1 are independent of each other and originate from the binding of PUFA to two different sites, conventionally indicated as Site I and Site II ( Yazdi et al., 2021; Liin et al., 2018 ). Site I is found in the VSD, where the PUFA head group interacts with the positive charges in the S4 segment and causes the channel to open at more negative potentials ( Liin et al., 2015 ). Site II is found in the pore domain, where electrostatic interactions between the PUFA head group and the positively charged residue, K326, facilitate an increase in the maximal conductance of the channel ( Liin et al., 2018; Figure 1E and F ). Although previous studies have shown the importance of K326 for PUFA in increasing Gmax through binding at Site II ( Liin et al., 2018 ), the mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax is still not understood. In this study, we use a combination of two-electrode voltage-clamp, single-channel recordings, site-directed mutagenesis, and recent cryoEM structures to gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the Gmax effect following PUFA binding at Site II. We propose a novel mechanism where the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 is normally unstable and the binding of PUFA to Site II stabilizes a network of interactions at the selectivity filter, which, in turn, leads to a more open and stable conformation of the KCNQ1 pore and thus an increase in channel open probability. 
 Lin-Glycine has been shown to increase the Gmax in whole-oocyte recordings of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels 2. 5-fold ( Bohannon et al., 2020 ). To better understand how Lin-Glycine increases Gmax, we here extended our analysis to the single-channel level to study the behavior of KCNQ1/KCNE1 in the absence and presence of Lin-Glycine ( 20 µM ) ( Figure 2 ). Representative traces ( Figure 2A and B ) and all points histograms ( Figure 2C and D ) suggest that there is no change in single-channel conductance between KCNQ1/KCNE1 in control and with Lin-Glycine. This shows that the Gmax effect is not due to an increase in the single-channel conductance. However, Lin-Glycine caused a decrease in the latency to first opening ( in control, 1. 78 ± 0. 36 s, n = 41 sweeps and after 20 µM Lin-Glycine, 1. 03 ± 0. 05 s, n = 99 sweeps; p=0. 0025 ) and an increase in the number of non-empty sweeps ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). In control, there are a high number of empty sweeps as shown before for KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels ( Werry et al., 2013 ). The average current during the single-channel sweeps was increased by 2. 3 ± 0. 33 times ( n = 4 patches, p=0. 006 ) by the application of Lin-Glycine ( Figure 2E ). The number of non-empty sweeps increased 2. 85-fold ( 2. 85 ± 0. 85, n = 200 sweeps from four patches; p=0. 001 ), going from a total of 41/200 non-empty sweeps in control to 99/200 when Lin-Glycine was applied. In contrast, once the channel opens, it seems to behave very similarly in control and Lin-Glycine because, in non-empty sweeps, the open probability ( Po ) in the last second of the traces was almost identical between control and Lin-Glycine conditions ( Po = 0. 78 ± 0. 02 [n = 8 sweeps] in control vs 0. 87 ± 0. 04 [n = 8 sweeps] in Lin-Glycine ) ( Figure 2F ). This high open probability was maintained in control conditions even for longer depolarizing voltage pulses, as if once the channels had opened they stayed open for the remaining of the voltage steps ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). The 2. 85-fold increase in the number of non-empty sweeps is very similar to the Gmax increase seen in macroscopic currents. The decrease in first latency is most likely due to an effect of Lin-Glyine stabilizing the selectivity filter, making it easier for the channel to enter the open state. The increase in the number of non-empty sweeps is likely due to stabilization of the selectivity filter in the open-conductive state, making it more likely for the channel to stay open once it has entered the open state. The stabilization of the selectivity filter in the open-conductive state is consistent with the cryo-EM structure of KCN1 in the presence of Lin-Glyine ( Figure 3 ), where the selectivity filter is in a more open and stable conformation than in the absence of Linlyine. The cryo-EM structure of KC1 in the presence of Linly ( Figure 3 ) shows that the selectivity filter is in a more open and stable conformation than in the absence of Linly ( Figure 3 ). This is consistent with our hypothesis that the selectivity filter is normally unstable and that Linly stabilizes it in the open-conductive state. The cry-EM structure of KC1 in the presence of Linly ( Figure 3 ) shows that the select filter is in a more open and stable conformation than in the absence of Lin ( Figure 3 ). This is consistent with our hypothesis that the selectivity is normally unstable and that Linly stabilizes it in the open-conductive. The cry-EM structure of KC1 in the presence of Lin ( Figure 3 ) shows the select is in a more open and stable than in the absence ( Figure 3 ) This is consistent with our hypothesis the select is normally unstable and Lin stabilizes in the open. The cry-EM of KC in the presence Lin ( Figure 3 ) shows the is in a more stable than the absence ( Figure 3 This consistent our hypothesis the is normally unstable and Lin stabilizes The cry-EM of KC in the presence ( Figure 3 shows the in a stable than the (3 consistent our hypothesis the normally unstable and stabil The cry-EM of KC in the (3 shows the in a than ( consistent our hypothesis the normally and stabil The cryEM of KC in ( shows the a than consistent our hypothesis normally and The cryEM KC in ( shows a consistent our hypothesis normally The cryEM KC ( shows consistent our normally

    Title: 
    Article: Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate ( PLP ), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7, 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7, 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7, 8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7, 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain. 
 Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system ( Bowling, 2011; Wilson et al., 2019 ), with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age ( di Salvo et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014 ). Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people ( Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003 ), and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline ( Hughes et al., 2017; Jannusch et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2022; Elias et al., 2006 ). Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory, including neuropsychiatric disorders ( Tomioka et al., 2018; Toriumi et al., 2021; Arai et al., 2010 ), Alzheimer’s disease ( Paul, 2021 ), and inflammation ( Ueland et al., 2017; Danielski et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear ( Mitchell et al., 2014; Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003; Wang et al., 2022b; Behrens et al., 2020; Hassel et al., 2019; Rutjes et al., 2018; Smith and Refsum, 2016; Aisen et al., 2008; Douaud et al., 2013 ). The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal ( collectively referred to as B6 vitamers ), and their phosphorylated forms. Among these, only pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( PLP ) is co-enzymatically active. In humans, PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions, including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters, amino acids, lipids, and glucose. In addition, B6 vitamers display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions ( Percudani and Peracchi, 2003; Eliot and Kirsch, 2004; Percudani and Peracchi, 2009; Parra et al., 2018 ). Cellular PLP availability in the brain depends on numerous factors, including the intestinal absorption of B6 vitamers, extracellular phosphatases, inter-organ transport and intracellular enzymes, and carriers/scavengers involved in PLP formation and homeostasis ( Wilson et al., 2019 ). Specifically, intracellular PLP is formed by the pyridoxal kinase ( PDXK ) -catalyzed phosphorylation of pyridoxal, or the pyridox ( am ) ine-5’-phosphate oxidase ( PNPO ) -catalyzed oxidation of pyridox ( am ) ine 5’-phosphate to PLP. PLP is highly reactive and can undergo condensation reactions with, e. g., primary amino groups or thiol groups in proteins or amino acids. Although the mechanisms of PLP delivery within the cells are still largely unknown, it is clear that the intracellular availability of PLP for co-enzymatic functions depends on PLP carriers/scavengers and on the hydrolytic activity of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ) ( Wilson et al., 2019; Ciapaite et al., 2023; Fux and Sieber, 2020; Jang et al., 2003; Jeanclos et al., 2019 ). We have previously shown that the genetic knockout of PDXP ( PDXP-KO ) in mice increases brain PLP levels and improves spatial memory and learning, suggesting that elevated PLP levels can improve cognitive functions in this model ( Jeanclos et al., 2019 ). We therefore reasoned that a pharmacological inhibition of PDXP may be leveraged to increase intracellular PLP levels and conducted a high-throughput screening campaign to identify small-molecule PDXP modulators. Here, we report the discovery and the structural and cellular validation of 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7, 8-DHF ) as a preferential PDXP inhibitor. 7, 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models characterized by impaired cognition, and widely regarded as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) agonist with brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) -mimetic activity ( Liu et al., 2016 ). However, a direct TrkB agonistic activity of 7, 8-DHF has been called into question ( Wang et al., 2022a; Boltaev et al., 2017; Pankiewicz et al., 2021; Todd et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2011 ). Our serendipitous discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects. More potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors may be useful future tools to explore a possible benefit of elevated PLP levels in brain disorders. 
 The hippocampus is important for age-dependent memory consolidation and learning, and impaired memory and learning is associated with PLP deficiency ( di Salvo et al., 2012 ). To study a possible contribution of PDXP and/or PDXK to age-related PLP homeostasis in the hippocampus, we performed western blot analyses in young versus older mice. Unexpectedly, we found that both PDXP and PDXK expression levels were markedly higher in hippocampi of middle-aged than of juvenile animals ( Figure 1a ). These data suggest an accelerated hippocampal PLP turnover in older mice, consistent with previous findings in senescent mice ( Fonda et al., 1980 ). An analysis of total hippocampal PLP levels in PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO mice showed an age-dependent profile. PLP levels appeared to peak around 3 months of age ( possibly reflecting PLP-dependent neurotransmitter biosynthesis and metabolism during the postnatal developmental period ) and descended back to juvenile levels by 12 months of age in both genotypes. Although total hippocampal PLP levels in PDXP-KO mice also decreased with age, they consistently remained above PLP levels in control mice ( Figure 1b; two-tailed, unpaired t-test of PLP levels in PDXP-WT vs. PDXP-KO hippocampi, all ages combined: p<0. 0001 ). PLP is protected from hydrolysis by binding to proteins, and PDXP is expected to dephosphorylate only non-protein-bound PLP ( Gohla, 2019 ). To test this, we prepared protein-depleted PLP fractions from PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO hippocampal lysates using 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal filters. The quantification of PLP in these fractions demonstrated that PDXP loss indeed only increased the pool of protein-depleted PLP, both in young ( 18–42 days of age ) and in older mice ( 252–352 days of age ) mice ( Figure 2 ). These results indicate that PDX is responsible for the age-dependent decline of PL levels in the hippocampus. To identify PDX modulators, we performed a high-throughput small-molecule screen against PDX activity in vitro ( Figure 3a ). We identified 7,8-dihydroflavone ( 7,8HF ) as a potent and selective PDX inhibitor with IC50 of 0. 1 μM ( Figure 3b ). 7,8HF inhibited PDX in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3c ) and was reversible ( Figure 3d ). The structure of 7,8HF in complex with PDX was determined by X-ray crystallography ( Figure 4 ). 7,8HF binds to the active site of PDX with low micromolar affinity and submicrom potency. To validate 7,8HF as a PDX inhibitor in vivo, we treated hippocamp neurons with 7,8HF and measured PL levels. 7,8HF increased PL in a PDX-dependent manner ( Figure 5 ). These findings validate PDX as a druggable target and 7,8HF as a potent and selective PDX inhibitor. Our discovery of 7,8 as a PDX inhibitor offers mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding ,8-mediated effects in the brain.

    Title: 
    Article: Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs; Z1 and Z4 ). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. 
 Most animals belonging to Bilateria have a mirror-symmetric body plan along the left-right axis, except for most internal organs. In mirror-symmetric tissues, cells in equivalent positions should acquire the same cell fates. Additionally, they are likely to exhibit mirror-symmetric polarity orientation for mirror-symmetric morphogenesis. However, the mechanism to produce mirror symmetric polarity has not even been postulated except for a few examples. At the midline of the neural rod in the developing zebrafish neural tube, the polarity regulator Pard3 is localized on the cleavage furrow of neural progenitors and inherited by the two daughter cells on either side of the midline ( Tawk et al., 2007 ). This results in a mirror-image apico-basal polarity of the daughter cells and the subsequent formation of the ventricle. In the dorsal and ventral sides of the compound eye of Drosophila, ommatidia have mirror-image chirality that is regulated by protocadherins Fat/Dachsous and PCP ( planar cell polarity ) signaling ( Rawls et al., 2002 ). During the development of C. elegans, most cells are polarized in the same anterior-posterior orientation and divide asymmetrically to produce distinct daughter cells ( Sawa, 2012 ). This polarity is regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway known as the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway ( Mizumoto and Sawa, 2007 ). Nuclear localization of POP-1/TCF, for example, is higher in the anterior than the posterior daughter cells ( hereafter called HL polarity for high-low POP-1 concentration ). However, there are some exceptions to the rule that result in mirror-symmetric polarity. During the development of the vulva, one of the vulval precursor cells ( VPCs ) P7. p has reversed polarity with higher POP-1 in the posterior daughter ( LH polarity for low-high POP-1 concentration ) ( Deshpande et al., 2005 ). The mirror symmetric polarity between P7. p and another VPC P5. p is essential for their mirror-symmetric lineages and the structure of the vulva. The LH polarity of P7. p is instructed by Wnt proteins secreted from the anchor cell located between P5. p and P7. p ( Green et al., 2008 ). In the gonad, at the L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor ( SGP ) cells, Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity, respectively, creating their mirror-symmetric lineages producing distal tip cells ( DTCs ) from the distal daughters ( Z1. a and Z4. p ) ( Siegfried et al., 2004; Figure 1A and B ). However, it is not known how this mirror-symmetric polarity is established. We have shown previously that SGP polarity is not affected in quintuple Wnt mutants that have mutations in all five Wnt genes in C. elegans, suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). DTCs, which are the most distal granddaughters of SGPs ( Z1. aa and Z4. pp ), have two functions. First, DTCs function as niche cells for germline stem cells, inhibiting their entry into meiosis by expressing the Notch ligand LAG-2 ( Henderson et al., 1994 ). Additionally, during gonadogenesis, each DTC migrates with a U-shaped trajectory to guide extension of gonad arms, resulting in U-shaped gonad both on the anterior and posterior sides ( Figure 1A ). A recent report suggests that DTCs may not actively migrate by themselves; instead, they are pushed distally by proliferating germ cells ( Agarwal et al., 2022 ). While the quintuple Wnt mutants exhibit normal SGP polarity, we observed a significant impact on polarity when Wnt mutations are present in the background of the lin-17/Frizzled mutation. For example, triple Wnt mutations ( cwn-1 cwn-2 and egl-20 ) combined with the lin-17 mutation disrupt the polarity of both Z1 and Z4. LIN-17 functions in a Wnt-independent manner, as LIN-17 lacking the Wnt binding domain ( cysteine-rich domain [CRD] ) can rescue gonadal defects in compound mutants containing the lin-17 mutation. In the lin-17 background, the three Wnts have distinct functions. Specifically, cwn-1 promotes HL polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while cwn-2 promotes LH and HL polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, egl-20 inhibits HL polarity induced by cwn-1. In lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 animals, both Z1 and Z4 show HL polarity disrupting the mirror symmetry of polarity. Notably, in this genotype, we observed that the DTC from Z1 frequently migrates posteriorly similar to that from Z4. We further demonstrated that the ectopic positions of DTCs in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration. Our results suggest that the distal positions of DTCs in the gonad through the mirror-symmetric polarity of SGPs are required for stable distal migration, consistent with the recent report supporting the permissive migration model ( Agarwal et al., 2022 ). However, the posterior migration of ectopically positioned DTCs from Z1 passing through germ cells in the triple mutants, along with DTC migration in germless mes-1 mutants, strongly suggests self-migratory mechanisms of DTCs. 
 We have previously demonstrated that DTC production and SGP polarity remain normal in any Wnt single or compound mutant strains including quintuple Wnt mutants ( lin-44; cwn-1; egl-20 cwn-2; mom-2 ), suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). However, when a cwn-2 mutation was combined with that of lin-17/Frizzled, we observed that most animals lacked one or both DTCs ( a missing DTC phenotype ) as determined by the expression of a DTC marker, mig-24::Venus ( Tamai and Nishiwaki, 2007 ). While lin-17 ( n3091 with nonsense mutation ) single mutants exhibit a weak missing DTC phenotype ( Table 1; Sternberg and Horvitz, 1988 ), lin-17; cwn-2 showed a strong enhancement in regard to the absence of the anterior DTC ( Table 1: p<0. 0001 by Pearson’s chi-square test ). We observed a similar phenotype in lin-17 ( n671 ) ; cwn-2 double mutants, confirming that this genetic interaction is not allele-specific. Although mutations in other Wnt genes ( cwn-1 and egl-20 ) by themselves or in combination did not cause such enhancements, the cwn-1 mutation enhanced the phenotype of lin-17; cwn-2 for both the anterior and posterior DTCs ( p<0. 0001 by Pearson’s chi-square test ), resulting in the majority of lin-17; cwn-1; cwn-2 triple mutants lacking both gonadal arms and being sterile. These results indicate that lin-17/Frizzled and Wnt genes ( cwn-1 and cwn-2 ) regulate DTC production through parallel pathways. We note that the DTC defects in various compound mutants described above and below were more severe at 15°C compared to 22. 5°C for unknown reasons. Since the temperature sensitivities of individual mutations have not been reported and most mutations are nonsense or deletions, we hypothesize that the processes for DTC production may be temperature-sensitive. In summary, our results show that Wnt signaling is required for the establishment of mirror-symmetric polarity in SGPs Z1 and Z4, which is necessary for the production and migration of DTCs in the gonad. This is the first demonstration of Wnt function in mirror-symmetric organogenesis in C. elegans and highlights the role of W signaling in coordinating the production and migration of Ds to establish a mirrorymmetric organ.

    Title: 
    Article: There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation. 
 How many different molecular mechanisms can a microbe exploit to adapt to a challenging environment? Answering this question is particularly urgent in the field of drug resistance because infectious populations are adapting to available drugs faster than new drugs are developed ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019, 2019; Ventola, 2015 ). Understanding the mechanistic basis of drug resistance can inform strategies for how to combine existing drugs in a way that prevents the evolution of resistance ( Andersson and Hughes, 2010; Melnikov et al., 2020; Pinheiro et al., 2021 ). For example, one strategy exposes an infectious population to one drug ( Drug A ) knowing that the mechanism of resistance to Drug A makes cells susceptible to Drug B ( Baym et al., 2016; Hall et al., 2009; Pál et al., 2015; Roemhild et al., 2020 ). Problematically, these multi-drug strategies perform best when all mutants that resist Drug A have the same tradeoff in Drug B ( Figure 1A ). If there are multiple different mechanisms to resist Drug A, some of which lack this tradeoff, treatment strategies could fail ( Figure 1B ), and they sometimes do ( Abel zur Wiesch et al., 2014; Grier et al., 2003; Scarborough et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019 ). Laboratory experiments that have power to search for universal tradeoffs – where all the mutants that perform well in one environment perform poorly in another – often find there are mutants that violate trends or the absence of trends altogether ( Ardell and Kryazhimskiy, 2021; Gjini and Wood, 2021; Herren and Baym, 2022; Hill et al., 2015; Kinsler et al., 2020; Nichol et al., 2019 ). Another way to phrase this observation is to say that adaptive mutations often have collateral effects in environments other than the one in which they originally evolved ( Pál et al., 2015 ). But these effects, referred to in some studies as pleiotropic effects, can be unpredictable and context dependent ( Bakerlee et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2020; Hinz et al., 2023; Jerison et al., 2020 ). In simpler terms, some mutants that resist Drug A will suffer a tradeoff in Drug B, but others may suffer a tradeoff in Drug C. To sum, observations from many fields suggest that the mutations that provide a benefit in one environment do not always suffer similar tradeoffs. This begs questions about the extent of diversity among adaptive mutations: does each one suffer a unique set of tradeoffs or can many adaptive mutants be grouped by their common tradeoffs? If there are only a few types of tradeoff present in a collection of adaptive mutations, multidrug treatments that target tradeoffs may be more feasible. The goal of the present study is to count how many different types of adaptive mutation, each type being defined by its unique tradeoffs, exist in a population of drug-resistant yeast. This simple counting exercise is surprisingly difficult. One reason why is that the mutations that provide the strongest fitness advantage often dominate evolution. Thus, in the clinic, and in laboratory experiments, the same drug-resistant mutations repeatedly emerge ( Berkow and Lockhart, 2017; Ksiezopolska et al., 2021; Lupetti et al., 2002; Melnikov et al., 2020 ), potentially leading to the false impression that the mechanistic basis of resistance to a particular drug, and the associated tradeoffs, are less varied than may be true. This problem is amplified by the limitations of bulk DNA sequencing methods which often miss mutations that are present in less than 10% of a population’s cells ( Good et al., 2017 ). A similar problem results from strategies to disentangle adaptive from passenger mutations that rely on observing the adaptive ones multiple times in multiple independent replicates ( Martínez and Lang, 2023 ). In order to design better multidrug treatment strategies that thwart resistance, or to see if such strategies are feasible, we need methods to survey a more complete set of mutations and mechanisms that can contribute to resistance. Fortunately, single-cell and single-lineage DNA sequencing technologies are allowing us to more deeply sample genetic diversity in evolving populations of microbes beyond the mutations that dominate evolution ( Schmidt and Efferth, 2016 ). Here, we leverage a cutting-edge lineage-tracing method to perform massively replicate evolution experiments in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). This method has been shown to reveal a fuller spectrum of mutations underlying adaptation to a particular environment ( Levy et al., 2015 ). One key to its success is that it uses DNA barcodes to track all competing adaptive lineages, not just the ones that ultimately rise to appreciable frequency. Another key feature is that it captures adaptive lineages before they accumulate multiple mutations such that it is easy to pinpoint which mutation is adaptive. We apply this method to investigate mechanisms underlying resistance to a specific antifungal drug: fluconazole ( FLU; Logan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022 ). Although serious fungal infections are most common in immunocompromised individuals, their impact on global health is still striking, resulting in over 1. 5 million deaths annually ( Iyer et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2014 ). By focusing on mechanisms of FLU resistance, we contribute to a growing literature about the tradeoffs that may be leveraged to design multidrug antifungal treatment strategies ( Cowen and Lindquist, 2005; Hill et al., 2015; Iyer et al., 2022; Ksiezopolska et al., 2021 ). However, our primary goal is more generic: we seek to explore the utility of a high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of drug resistant mutant and their associated tradeoffs. To enhance the diversity of drug resistant mutants in our experiment, we performed multiple laboratory evolutions in a range of FLU concentrations and sometimes in combination with a second drug. We did so because previous work has shown that different drug concentrations and combinations select for different azole resistance mechanisms ( Cowen and Lindquist, 2005; Hill et al., 2015 ). Ultimately, we obtained a large collection of 774 adaptive yeast strains. But how do we know whether we succeeded in isolating diverse types of FLU-resistant mutants? Typical phenotyping methods, for example quantifying expression levels of drug export pumps ( Miyazaki et al., 1998 ) or of the drug targets themselves ( Palmer and Kishony, 2014 ), are low throughput and require some a priori knowledge of the phenotypes that may be involved in drug resistance. Alternatively, many studies focus on identifying the genetic basis of adaptation in order to glean insights about the underlying mechanisms of resistance ( Cowen et al., 2014; Tenaillon et al., 2012; Venkataram et al., 2016 ). However, genotyping lineages from barcoded pools is technically challenging ( Venkataram et al., 2016 ), and further, genotype does not necessarily predict phenotype ( Brettner et al., 2022; Eguchi et al., 2019 ). For example, previous work using the same barcoded evolution platform used here discovered that the mutations that provide an advantage under glucose-limitation are in genes comprising a canonical glucose-sensing pathway ( Venkataram et al. 2016 ). However, mutations in this pathway do not necessarily confer resistance to FLU. To address these challenges, we quantify the fitness of each of the 774 mutants across 12 environments, including the one in which they evolved. This approach allows us to group mutants into classes with characteristically tradeoffs. We find that mutants can be grouped into 5 distinct classes, each with unique tradeoffs that imply different underlying mechanisms of resistance. Some of these groupings are surprising. For example, we find that some mutants that resist FL do not resist its combination with a second drug, while others do. And mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to few with characteristic trade, our findings may empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally, by grouping mutants that likely fitness through similar mechanisms our work guides to map the phenotypic effects of mutation. 
How many molecular mechanisms can a microbe exploit to adapt to a challenging environment? Answer this question is particularly urgent in the field of drug resistance because infectious are adapting to drugs faster than new are developed ( Centers Disease and Prevention,2019; Ventola,201 ) Understanding mechanistic of drug can inform strategies to combine drugs in way prevents evolution ( Anders and Hughes,201; Melov et al,202; Pinheiro et,202 ) For example, one exposes population to drug A that mechanism resistance to A makes susceptible B ( Bay et al,201; Hall et al,200; Pál et,201; Roemild,202 ) Problem, these strategies best when mutants resist A have same trade B ( Figure ) If multiple mechanisms resist A some lack trade, strategies fail ( et al,201; Grier et,200; Scarborough et,202; Wang,201 ) experiments power search universal where mutants perform well one poorly another often find violate or absence trends ( Ardell Kazhimiy,202; Gini Wood,202; Her Bay,202; Hill et,201; Kler,202; Nich,201 ) effects in other environments than one they evolved can be unpredictable context ( Baker et,202; Chen,202; Ge-Sotte,202; Hinz,202; Jer,202 ) some that resist A suffer trade B others trade C sum observations suggest mutations benefit one environment do not similar trade begs extent diversity among adaptive each suffer unique or can mutants grouped common If few types present multid treatments target feasible goal present is count types adaptive each defined unique exist population drug-resistant simple exercise difficult reason dominate evolution often same-resistant emerge ( Berk Lockhart,201; Kiezolska,202; Lupetti,200; Melov,202 ) limitations DNA methods miss present less population ( Good,201 ) strategies disangle passenger observe multiple replicates ( Martnez Lang, ) to multidrug thwart or see feasible need survey more mechanisms contribute single-cell sequencing technologies sample diversity evolving microbes beyond dominate Schmidt Effer, Here leverage cutting-edge method replicate experiments yeast ( cerevisiae ) shown reveal spectrum adaptation environment Levy, key uses barcodes track competing lineages feature captures lineages accumulate pinpoint mutation apply investigate antifluconazole ( FL; Logan, Wang, ) although infections immunocomised impact global annually ( Iyer, Xie ) focusing mechanisms FL contribute literature trade multidrug antungal ( Cow Lind, Hill, Iyer, Kiezols ) primary generic explore utility high-throughput enumerate resistant trade We performed evolutions FL concentrations sometimes combination second obtained collection 774 strains know succeeded isolating diverse mutants phenotyping expression drug pumps targets ( Miyaki, Palmer ) throughput prior knowledge involved resistance genotyping lineages barcoded technically ( Venaram ) genotype phenotype Brett, Eguchi, previous glucose pathway Venaram discovered mutations glucose-sensing ( Venaram ) mutations confer FL address challenges quantify mutants environments

    Title: 
    Article: The central tendency bias, or contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain’s ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought: when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior, we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience – producing short-term sensory history biases – naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors, occurring at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution’s mean. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task. 
 A fundamental question in neuroscience relates to how brains efficiently process the statistical regularities of the environment to guide behavior. Exploiting such regularities may be of great value to survival in the natural environment, but may lead to biases in laboratory tasks. Repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities is the central tendency ( ‘contraction’ ) bias, where performance in perceptual tasks seemingly reflects a shift of the working memory ( WM ) representation toward the mean of the sensory history ( Hollingworth, 1910; Jou et al., 2004; Berliner et al., 1977; Hellström, 1985; Raviv et al., 2012; Fischer and Whitney, 2014 ). Equally common are sequential biases, either attractive or repulsive, toward the immediate sensory history ( Akrami et al., 2018; Raviv et al., 2012; Kiyonaga et al., 2017; Cicchini et al., 2017; Czoschke et al., 2019; Alais et al., 2018; Manassi et al., 2018; Manassi et al., 2017; Suárez-Pinilla et al., 2018; Fischer and Whitney, 2014; Papadimitriou et al., 2015 ). It is commonly thought that these biases occur due to disparate mechanisms – contraction bias is widely thought to be a result of learning the statistical structure of the environment, whereas serial biases are thought to reflect the contents of WM ( Lieder et al., 2019; Barbosa and Compte, 2020 ). Recent evidence, however, challenges this picture: our recent study of a parametric working memory ( PWM ) task discovered that the rat posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) plays a key role in modulating contraction bias ( Akrami et al., 2018 ). When the region is optogenetically inactivated, contraction bias is attenuated. Intriguingly, however, this is also accompanied by the suppression of bias effects induced by the recent history of the stimuli, suggesting that the two phenomena may be interrelated. Interestingly, other behavioral components, including WM of immediate sensory stimuli ( in the current trial ), remain intact. In another recent study with humans, a double dissociation was reported between three cohorts of subjects: subjects on the autistic spectrum ( ASD ) expressed reduced biases due to recent statistics, whereas dyslexic subjects ( DYS ) expressed reduced biases toward long-term statistics, relative to neurotypical subjects ( NT ) ( Lieder et al., 2019 ). Finally, further complicating the picture is the observation of not only attractive serial dependency, but also repulsive biases ( Fritsche and Spaak, 2020 ). It is as of yet unclear how such biases occur and what mechanisms underlie such history dependencies. These findings stimulate the question of whether contraction bias and the different types of serial biases are actually related, and if so, how. Although normative models have been proposed to explain these effects ( Ashourian and Loewenstein, 2011; Fritsche and Spaak, 2020; Lieder et al., 2019 ), the neural mechanisms and circuits underlying them remain poorly understood. We address this question through a model of the putative circuit involved in giving rise to the behavior observed in Akrami et al., 2018. Our model consists of two continuous ( bump ) attractor sub-networks, representing a WM module and the PPC. Given the finding that PPC neurons carry more information about stimuli presented during previous trials, the PPC module integrates inputs over a longer timescale relative to the WM network and incorporates firing rate adaptation. We find that both contraction bias and short-term sensory history effects emerge in the WM network as a result of inputs from the PPC network. Importantly, we see that these effects do not necessarily occur due to separate mechanisms. Rather, in our model, contraction bias emerges as a statistical effect of errors in WM, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in the preceding trials. The integration of this persisting memory in the WM module competes with that of the stimulus in the current trial, giving rise to short-term history effects. We conclude that contraction biases in such paradigms may not necessarily reflect explicit learning of regularities or an ‘attraction toward the mean’ on individual trials. Rather, it may be an effect emerging at the level of average performance, when in each trial errors are made according to the recent sensory experiences whose distribution follow that of the input stimuli. Furthermore, using the same model, we also show that the biases toward long-term ( short-term ) statistics inferred from the performance of ASD ( DYS ) subjects ( Lieder et al., 2019 ) may actually reflect short-term biases extending more or less into the past with respect to NT subjects, challenging the hypothesis of a double-dissociation mechanism. Last, we show that as a result of neuronal integration of inputs and adaptation, in addition to attraction effects occurring on a short timescale, repulsion effects are observed on a longer timescale ( Fritsche and Spaak, 2020 ). We make specific predictions on neuronal dynamics in the PPC and downstream WM areas, as well as how contraction bias may be altered, upon manipulations of the sensory stimulus distribution, intertrial and interstimulus delay intervals. We show agreements between the model and our previous results in humans and rats. Finally, we test our model predictions by performing new human auditory PWM tasks. The data is in agreement with our model and not with an alternative Bayesian model. 
 PWM tasks involve the sequential comparison of two graded stimuli that differ along a physical dimension and are separated by a delay interval of a few seconds ( Figure 1A and B; Romo and Salinas, 2003; Akrami et al., 2018; Ashourian and Loewenstein, 2011 ). A key feature emerging from these studies is contraction bias, where the averaged performance is as if the memory of the first stimulus progressively shifts toward the center of a prior distribution built from past sensory history ( Figure 1C ). Additionally, biases toward the most recent sensory stimuli ( immediately preceding trials ) have also been documented ( Akrami et al., 2018; Raviv et al., 2012 ). In order to investigate the circuit mechanisms by which such biases may occur, we use two identical one-dimensional continuous attractor networks to model WM and PPC modules. Neurons are arranged according to their preferential firing locations in a continuous stimulus space, representing the amplitude of auditory stimuli. Excitatory recurrent connections between neurons are symmetric and a monotonically decreasing function of the distance between the preferential firing fields of neurons, allowing neurons to mutually excite one another; inhibition, instead, is uniform. Together, both allow a localized bump of activity to form and be sustained ( Figure 1D and E; Sebastian Seung, 1998; Wang, 2001; Zhong et al., 2020; Spalla et al., 2021; Wu and Amari, 2005; Wu et al., 2016; Fung et al., 2008; Fung et al., 2010; Trappenberg, 2005 ). Both networks have free boundary conditions. Neurons in the WM network receive inputs from neurons in the PPC coding for the same stimulus amplitude ( Figure 1D ). Building on experimental findings ( Murray et al., 2014; Siegle et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023; Mejías and Wang, 2022; Ding et al., 2022 ), we designed the PPC network such that it integrates activity over a longer timescale compared to the WM network section ‘The model’. Moreover, neurons in the PPC are equipped with neural adaptation that can be thought of as a threshold that dynamically follows the activation of a neuron over a longer timescale. To simulate the PWM task, we run the networks with a sequence of stimuli with varying amplitudes ( Figure 2 ). We find that both contraction and short-term history effects emerge in the WM as a result of inputs from the PPC. Importantly, we see that these effects do not occur due to separate mechanisms. Rather, in our model, contraction emerges as a statistical effect of errors in WM, due to persisting memory of stimuli in the preceding trials. The integration of this persisting memory in WM competes with that of the stimulus in the trial, giving rise to short-term effects. We conclude that contraction in paradigms may not reflect explicit learning of regularities or attraction toward the mean on individual trials. Rather, it may be an effect at the level of performance, when errors are made according to recent experiences whose distribution of stimuli follow the input. Furthermore, using the same model, we show that biases toward long-term ( short ) inferred from performance of ASD ( DYS ) subjects ( Lieder et al,201 ) may reflect short biases extending or less into the past with respect NT subjects, challenging the hypothesis of dissociation mechanism. Last, we show as a result of integration and adaptation, in addition to effects on short timescale, repulsion are observed on longer ( Fritche and Spa,202 ). We make predictions on dynamics in PPC and WM areas, as well as how bias may be altered upon manipulations of distribution interstimulus intervals and delay. We show agreements between model and previous results in humans and rats. Finally, we test predictions by performing new human PWM tasks. The data is with our model and not an alternative. 
The article discusses the phenomenon of central bias or contraction, where the judgment of the magnitude of items in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This is thought to be an optimal strategy of the brain and an expression of its ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, recency biases such as serial dependence are also observed and thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than thought: the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short and contraction were reduced. A model of the circuit may be involved in generating the behavior, showing that working memory susceptible to shifting the past experience producing short sensory biases naturally leads to contraction. The results are consistent with a set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different distributions and timings, as well as neuronal in working areas. Finally, the model is validated by a set of human psychophysics experiments an auditory param working task.

    Title: 
    Article: Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers. 
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women with a 5-year survival rate of only 22% ( Siegel et al., 2022 ). Although these outcomes may be improved by immune checkpoint blockade therapy involving the disruption of the binding of programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1, also known as CD279 ) on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) to programmed death receptor ligand 1 ( PD-L1, also known as B7-H1 or CD274 ) on tumor and tumor-associated cells, most lung cancer patients still fail the therapy, with a response rate of only about 20% ( Doroshow et al., 2019 ). In general, this revolutionary immunotherapy works better against ‘hot’ tumors, which have abundant TILs, strong immunogenicity and sufficient PD-L1 expression. Unfortunately, most tumors are ‘cold’, with low T-cell infiltration, weak immunogenicity and minimal PD-L1 expression, and show weak response to immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs; Zou et al., 2016; Zappasodi et al., 2018 ). Cold lung tumors without targetable oncogenic drivers are treated with chemotherapy as the standard approach ( Baxevanos and Mountzios, 2018 ). However, the response rate to this conventional cancer therapy is also low and resistance often occurs after an initial response, with an overall survival ( OS ) of about 12–17 months. Given its roles in inducing TILs and immunogenicity, in particular PD-L1 expression, to turn cold tumors hot, chemotherapy can be an ideal candidate for combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to improve therapeutic efficacy ( Sun et al., 2019 ). Indeed, combination treatment with ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs shows synergy and better efficacy in both preclinical animal models and clinical trials of lung cancer and other cancers ( Sun et al., 2019; Garassino et al., 2020; Leonetti et al., 2019 ). However, even with the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy, tumors in animals do not remit completely and the objective response rate ( ORR ) of lung cancer patients only reaches 33–49. 7%, with a median progression-free survival ( PFS ) of just 5. 1–9 months and a median OS of 13–22 months ( Garassino et al., 2020; Leonetti et al., 2019 ). Thus, further improvement over the chemo-immunotherapy is direly needed. Our recent human and mouse studies have shown that most lung tumors not only have low TILs and decreased PD-L1, but also down-regulate major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ), evading recognition and attack by CD8+ T cells, including those unleashed by ICIs and/or recruited by chemotherapy ( Sun et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020; Guo and Qu, 2021 ). Following our previous cell line studies ( Qu et al., 2010a; Qu et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2009b; Vanoirbeek et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2009a; Fu et al., 2010 ), we have established the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein PDLIM2, also known as SLIM or mystique ( Torrado et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2005; Loughran et al., 2005 ), as a bona fide tumor suppressor and its repression as a causative driver of lung cancer and resistance to ICIs and chemotherapeutic agents ( Sun et al., 2019 ). While PDLIM2 is epigenetically repressed in human lung cancer, associating with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis, its global or lung epithelial-specific deletion in mice leads to lung cancer development, chemoresistance, and complete resistance to anti-PD-1 and epigenetic drugs. One most important function of PDLIM2 is to promote the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) RelA ( also known as p65 ), two master transcription factors that function as proto-oncogenes in lung and many other cancers ( Sun et al., 2019; Guo and Qu, 2021; Qu et al., 2010a; Qu et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2015; Tanaka et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2015; Steinbrecher et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009; Xiao and Fu, 2011 ). PDLIM2 repression in tumor cells thus results in the persistent activation of STAT3 and RelA, leading to MHC-I downregulation and high expression of tumor growth-related genes ( Sun et al., 2019 ). It also leads to strong induction of multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) for acquired chemo-resistance, as chemotherapy further enhances RelA activation for MDR1 transcription in PDLIM2 deficient tumor cells ( Sun et al., 2019 ). In this study, we examined whether and how PDLIM2 can be targeted to treat lung cancer in a faithful mouse model of human lung cancer. In particular, we tested whether systemic administration of nanoparticle-encapsulated PDLIM2-expression plasmids ( nanoPDLIM2 ) could enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and/or chemotherapeutic drugs. We also examined whether PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves genetic deletion and its relationship with epigenetic silencing. These studies indicate that besides epigenetic repression, loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) contributes to PDLIM2 downregulation in about 58% of human lung tumors, and that Pdlim2 heterozygous deletion ( Pdlim2+/- ) mice develop spontaneous tumors in lung and other organs. Notably, systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 reverses the phenotypes caused by PDLIM2 repression and induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most mice without further increasing toxicity when combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers. 
 Using 40% of the expression level in matched normal lung tissues as the cut-off in the analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) data, we found that PDLIM2 was repressed in over 75% of human lung tumors in a prior study ( Sun et al., 2019 ). If using 50% as the cut-off, PDLIM2 was repressed in about 94% of human lung tumors ( Figure 1A ). Using 125% of the methylation level of the PDLIM2 promoter in normal lung tissues as the cut-off to analyze TCGA database, over 70% of human lung tumors were found to have hypermethylation of the PDLIM2 promoter ( Figure 1A and B ), further validating our previous finding of epigenetic silencing of PIM in lung cancer ( Sun et al, 2019 ) LOH of PIM was found in about 58% of human lung tumors ( Figure 1 C ), indicating genetic deletion of PIM contributes to its downregulation in lung cancer. We also found that LOH of PIM was associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients ( Figure 1 D ), consistent with our previous study ( Sun et al, 2019 ). To investigate the role of PIM in lung cancer, we generated PIM heterozygous ( PIM+/- ) mice, which develop spontaneous lung tumors and other organs ( Figure 2 A ). PIM heterozygous mice also showed increased expression of STAT3 and RelA, downregulation of MHC-I and tumor-related genes ( Figure 2 B and C ) consistent with our previous studies ( Sun et al 2019; Gu and Qu 2021 ). To test the therapeutic potential of PIM in lung cancer, we encapsulated PIM-expression plasmids in nanoparticles ( nanoDL2 ) and administered systemically to mice with lung cancer ( Figure 3 A ). nanoDL2 showed low toxicity and high specificity for tumor ( Figure 3 B ) and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-P-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs ( Figure 3 C ) with complete remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in remaining ( Figure 3 D ). Mechanistically, nanoDL2 increased MHC expression, suppressed MDR1 induction and tumor-related genes in tumor cells ( Figure 4 ) and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration ( Figure 5 ) turning cold tumors hot and sensitive to IC and chemotherapeutic drugs ( Figure 6 ) and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) unleashed by IC ( Figure 7 ). These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.

    Title: 
    Article: To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPRER and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments. 
 Food is essential for the survival, growth, and fitness of all animals. To adapt to fluctuating environments with a wide range of food sources, animals have developed a food evaluation system. This system enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoids low-quality or toxic food, thereby maximizing their survival prospects ( Filosa et al., 2016; Florsheim et al., 2021; McLachlan et al., 2022 ). Various sensory neuron evaluation systems in animals has evolved to evaluate food quality through vision ( Avery et al., 2021; Melin et al., 2019 ), olfactory ( Bargmann, 2006; Chalasani et al., 2007; Fiala, 2007; Ha et al., 2010; McLachlan et al., 2022; Sengupta et al., 1996; Troemel et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2021 ) and gustatory senses ( Hukema et al., 2006; Ni et al., 2013; Scott, 2018 ). Besides these sensory systems that facilitate quick feeding decisions, animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors ( Jones and Candido, 1999; Xie et al., 2022 ). This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food. However, the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored. More specifically, while cellular stress response through UPRER ( Richardson et al., 2010 ) and PMK-1/p38 MAPK ( Kim et al., 2002 ) -dependent immunity in response to pathogens have been extensively studied, the functions of these cellular stress response in sensing and evaluating specific nutrients from food remain unclear. Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans due to the loss of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway ( Carr and Maggini, 2017 ). Animals obtain vitamin C from their diet and possibly also from gut microbes ( Steinert et al., 2020 ). Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters ( Carr and Frei, 1999; Li and Schellhorn, 2007 ). Vitamin C has been associated with various human diseases including scurvy, immune defect and cardiovascular disease ( Carr and Maggini, 2017 ). Therefore, in animals, having robust food evaluation systems to detect vitamin C levels could significantly impact their survival in the wild. However, the potential involvement of the cellular stress response pathway in this food evaluation system for sensing and assessing vitamin C remains largely unexplored. In this study, using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established ( Qi et al., 2017 ), we elucidated the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis. This mechanism promotes animals to leave low-quality food and is critical for their survival in nature environments. 
 Our previous studies have shown that Heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), which lacks certain molecules, is considered a low-quality food that is unable to support animal growth ( Qi and Han, 2018; Qi et al., 2017 ). Moreover, through metabolic-seq analysis, we identified significant changes in a large numbers of derivatives ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, Supplementary file 1a ), including lipids and their derivatives ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, Supplementary file 1b ), amino acid and their metabolites ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Supplementary file 1c ), as well as coenzymes and vitamins ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, Supplementary file 1d ). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in carboxylic acids and their derivatives ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, Supplementary file 1e ) in E. coli after being heat-killed ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, Supplementary file 1f ). This suggests that HK-E. coli is nutritionally deficient for C. elegans when compared to normal E. coli food. Next, we conducted two behavior assays to facilitate the analysis of the food evaluation process in animals by seeding L1 animals in assay plates ( Figure 1A and B ). In the avoidance assay, wild-type animals avoided the HK-E. coli OP50 ( HK-OP50 ) food ( Figure 1A ). Interestingly, in the food choice assay, animals initially showed no preference between the two types of food ( 1–2 hr ), but eventually exhibited a preference for high-quality food ( Live E. coli ) up until the 17 hr mark ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1G ). This suggests that worms depart from the HK-E. coli after recognizing it as low-quality food source through ingestion. In order to investigate the pathways in animals that respond to HK-E. coli, we performed transcriptomics analysis on worms that were cultured with both HK-E. coli and Live E. coli. Gene-expression profiling revealed that stress response genes, including those related to biotic stimulus, immune response and response to stress, are up-regulated in animals fed with HK-E. coli OP50 ( HK-OP50; Figure 1C, Supplementary file 2a ). Among these up-regulated genes, we identified 11 out of 62 of UPRER target genes ( Figure 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1H and Supplementary file 2b ). Additionally, about 50–80% of up-regulated genes overlap with genes responding pathogenic bacteria ( Nakad et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2012; Figure 1E, Supplementary file 2c ). Consistent with the results of the RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) analysis, the UPRER reporter ( Phsp-4::GFP ) ( Calfon et al., 2002 ) and immunity reporter ( Pirg-5::GFP ) ( Bolz et al., 2010 ) were strongly induced in intestine ( Figure 1F–G ) and neurons ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) by feeding unfavorable food ( HK-E. coli OP50 ), suggesting that UPRER and immune pathways may respond to low-quality food ( HK-E. coli OP50 ). As intestinal fluorescence ( Phsp-4::GFP or Pirg-5::GFP ) is easy observation and scoring, the further analyses were done in the intestine. Moreover, UPRMt reporter ( Phsp-6::GFP ) ( Yoneda et al., 2004 ) was weakly induced under HK-E. coli feeding condition ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ), and starved worm did not induce UPRER and immunity ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D ). Together, these findings suggest that low-quality food ( HK-E. coli OP50 ) triggers a stress response pathway in animals, including UPRER and innate immune pathway. This implies that animals may assess the quality of food through UPRER and innate immune pathway. To determine whether the UPRER and innate immune pathways play a role in evaluating low-quality food, we first examined whether the activation of the UPRER by HK-E. coli was dependent on the known signaling components of the UPRER branches, including IRE/XBP-1, PERK/ATF-4 and ATF-6 ( Hetz et al., 2020; Ron and Walter, 2007 ). We observed no difference in Phsp-4::GFP induction with atf-4 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) or atf-6 ( Figure 2— supplement 1B ) in worms fed HK-E coli, suggesting that UER activation is not dependent on these branches. However, we observed a significant induction of Ph-4::FP ( Figure 2— supplementC ) and Pir-5::FP ( Figure 2— supplement ) in worms fed HK-E coli, indicating that UER activation is dependent on the PM-1/p38 MAPK pathway. This suggests that PM-1/p38 MAPK is a key component of the UER pathway in response to low-quality food Next, we tested whether the PM-1/p38 MAPK pathway is required for the UER response to HK-E coli by inhibiting PM-1/p38 MAPK using the inhibitor SB203580 ( Figure 3A ). Inhibition of PM-1/p38 resulted in a significant decrease in Ph-::FP ( Figure 3B ) and Pir-::FP ( Figure 3 ) in worms fed HK-E coli, indicating that PM-1/p MAPK is required for the UER response to HK-E coli. Moreover, inhibition of PM-1/p MAP resulted in a decrease in avoidance of HK-E coli ( Figure 3C ), suggesting that PM-1/p MAP is also required for the behavioral response to low-quality food Finally, we tested whether the UER and PM-1/p MAP pathway is sufficient for the response to low-quality food by overexpressing PM-1 ( Figure 4A ). Overexpression of PM-1 resulted in a significant increase in Ph-:: ( Figure 4 ) and Pir:: ( 4 ) in worms fed HK-E coli, indicating that PM-1 is sufficient for the UER response to HK coli. Moreover, overexpression of PM- resulted in an increase in avoidance of HK coli ( Figure 4 ), suggesting that PM-1 is sufficient for the behavioral response to low-quality These results indicate that the UER and PM-1/p MAP pathway is required and sufficient for the response to low-quality food. To determine whether the UER and PM-1 MAP pathway is also required for the adaptation to low-quality food, we tested the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the UER PM-1 response to HK coli. Supplementation of vitamin C resulted in a decrease in Ph-:: ( Figure 5 ) and Pir:: ( 5 ) in worms fed HK coli, indicating that vitamin C inhibits the UER PM-1 response. Moreover, supplementation of vitamin resulted in a decrease in avoidance of HK coli ( Figure 5 ), suggesting that vitamin inhibits the behavioral response to low-quality These results indicate that vitamin C inhibits the UER PM-1 pathway in response to low food Finally, we tested the effect of vitamin C on the adaptation to low food by feeding worms with HK-E coli supplemented with vitamin C ( Figure 6 ). Supplementation of vitamin resulted in a significant increase in growth ( Figure 6 ) and survival ( Figure 6 ) of worms fed HK coli, indicating that vitamin promotes adaptation to low food. These results suggest that vitamin inhibits the UER PM-1 response and promotes adaptation to low food. Overall, our study reveals the role of the cellular stress pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food thereby enhancing survival in natural environments. The UER and PM-1 MAP pathway is required and sufficient for response to low-quality food, and vitamin inhibits this pathway promotes adaptation to low food.

    Title: 
    Article: As a major class of biomolecules, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes. However, it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Here, we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a drug target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs. Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study, we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14, and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7. Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14, a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2. 60-D2. 64-K7. 35-E7. 36 [KDKE] ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ), and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12. These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs. 
 As significant components of the organism, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in energy supply, cell signaling, and immune responses ( Gagneux and Varki, 1999 ). Dysregulation of carbohydrates has been proved to be associated with the development of various diseases ( Reily et al., 2019 ). However, it is still elusive how carbohydrates directly act on major therapeutic targets, including G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( Cheng and Jiang, 2019; Hauser et al., 2017 ). P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) represents an outstanding model system for understanding carbohydrate modulation of GPCRs. It belongs to P2Y purinoceptor subfamily, consisting of receptors responding to nucleotides, including adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and UDP ( Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998 ). Distinct from the other purinoceptors, P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, that is, UDP-sugars ( Abbracchio et al., 2006; Jacobson et al., 2020 ). UDP-sugars activate P2Y14 with a relative potency order of UDP-glucose ( UDP-Glc ), UDP-galactose ( UDP-Gal ), UDP-glucuronic acid ( UDP-GlcA ), and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine ( UDP-GlcNAc ) ( Chambers et al., 2000; Hamel et al., 2011; Ko et al., 2009; Ko et al., 2007 ). These sugar nucleotides act as important signaling molecules via P2Y14 to mediate many physiological processes ( Amison et al., 2017; Breton and Brown, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2017; Lazarowski, 2010; Müller et al., 2005; Sesma et al., 2016 ). Particularly, UDP-Glc regulates immune responses and associate with asthma, kidney injury, and lung inflammation ( Amison et al., 2017; Breton and Brown, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2005; Sesma et al., 2016 ). As an isomer of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal is present in various cell models, including physiologically relevant primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells ( Lazarowski, 2010 ). It remains unknown how these sugar nucleotides are recognized by P2Y14. As the closest homolog to P2Y14, P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) has not been reported to be activated by any sugar nucleotide ( Jacobson et al., 2020; Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998 ). P2Y12 is potently activated ADP. The reported agonist-bound structures of P2Y12 provide insights to understand the nucleotide activation of P2Y purinoceptors. The crystal structures of P2Y12 show that a full agonist 2-methylthio-adenosine-5’-diphosphate ( 2MeSADP, a close analogue of ADP ) binds to an extracellular pocket consisting of transmembrane ( TM ) helices and extracellular loops ( Zhang et al., 2014a ). Since P2Y12 is highly similar to P2Y14 with 45. 67% amino acid sequence identity, it would be interesting to investigate whether this receptor is also sensible to sugar nucleotides. Here, we combined molecular docking, molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations, and functional study to reveal the molecular mechanism how P2Y14 is activated by a sugar nucleotide. The ligand-binding models of different UDP-sugars ( UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-GlcNAc ) were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar recognition site of P2Y14. Both P2Y14 and P2Y12 were employed to unveil a conserved sugar-binding motif. Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as their agonists targeting the conserved functional motif. 
 Both UDP and UDP-Glc potently activate P2Y14 with EC50 values of 50. 9±6. 1 nM and 40. 3±1. 5 nM, respectively ( Figure 1A–C ). Compared with UDP, UDP-Glc showed an increased potency on P2Y14 at high concentration ( Figure 1B–C ), suggesting that the sugar moiety of UDP-Glc contributes to activating P2Y14. To investigate how UDP-Glc regulates the P2Y14 via its sugar moiety, we used molecular docking to construct UDP-Glc-bound models of P2Y14 and compared them with UDP-bound P2Y14 models ( Figure 1D–G ). Because the protein structure of P2Y14 is unrevealed, we employed the X-ray structures of P2Y12 ( Zhang et al., 2014a ) as templates to constructed homology models of human P2Y14. The molecular docking showed that both UDP and UDP-Glc bind to an extracellular pocket consisting of TM helices 2–7 and extracellular loop ( ECL ) 2 ( Figure 1D ), which is corresponding to a known agonist binding pocket of P2Y12 ( Zhang et al., 2014a ). The docking score of UDP-Glc is –9. 3 kcal/mol, and that of UDP is –8. 5 kcal/mol, indicating that both UDP and UDP-Glc bind to P2Y14. Compared with the UDP-bound receptor model ( Figure 1E ), the UDP-Glc-bound model showed extra interactions between the glucose moiety and the TM2, TM3, TM7, and ECL2 of P2Y14 ( Figure 1F ), enhancing the binding of UDP-Glc. Based on these molecular docking models, we further decomposed the ligand-binding energy to each receptor residue ( Figure 1G ). Five residues ( K772. 60, D812. 64, N903. 21, I170ECL2, and E2787. 36; superscript indicates Ballesteros-Weinstein residue numbering; Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995 ) were predicted to stabilize UDP-Glc binding ( Figure 1F and G ), while they made few energetic contributions ( van der Waals energy >–0. 25 Rosetta energy unit ) to UDP binding ( Figure 1E and G ). As shown in Figure 1E and F, two sub-pockets of P2Y14 were unveiled for ligand binding. The sub-pocket 1 is formed by 16 residues of TMs 3–7 and ECL2 ( Figure 1G, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B ) and binds to the nucleotide moiety of the agonist, that is, UDP. The sub-pocket 2 is the specific sugar-binding site involving K772. 60, D812. 64, N903. 21, I170ECL2, and E2787. 36 ( Figure 1F and G ). These residues are primarily charged or polar amino acids, which could made hydrogen bonds with the glucose hydroxyl groups of UDP-Glc ( Figure 1F ). To validate the proposed sugar-binding sites, we designed single-point mutations of these five residues ( K77A, D81A, N90A, I170A, and E278A ). Among these mutants, D81A showed significantly reduced activities by UDP-Glc compared with the wild-type ( WT ) group ( Figure 1H ). However, substitution of D812. 64 by alanine did not significantly affect the receptor activities by UDPlc ( Figure 1H ), suggesting that D812 64 is not crucial for UDPlc binding. In contrast, mutations of K772 and E278 significantly reduced UDPlc activities ( Figure 1H ), indicating that K772 and E7 36 are important for UDPlc binding. To investigate the conserved nature of the sugar-binding motif, we employed P2 purinoceptor 12 ( P2 ), which shares 45.67 amino acid identity with PY14 and is not reported to be activated by any sugarotide ( Jacobson et al, 202; Rvic and Burn,1998 ). We found that UDP-G and UDPlc potently activate P2 with EC50 values of 50.9± 6.1 nM and 40.3 1.5 nM, respectively ( Figure 2A–C ), indicating that the conserved sugar-binding motif is functional in both P2 and P2. To further validate the conserved motif, we designed UDP-G and UDPlc as agonists of P2 ( Figure 2D–F ). Both UDP-G and UDPlc potently activate P2 with EC50 values of 50.9 6.1 nM and 40.3.5 nM, respectively ( Figure 2–C ), suggesting that the sugar moiety of UDP-G contributes to activating P2. To investigate how UDP-G regulates P2 via its sugar moiety, we used molecular docking to UDP-G-bound models of P2 and compared with UDP-bound P2 models ( Figure 2– ). The docking showed that UDP and UDPlc bind an extracellular pocket of TM 2–7 and ECL ( Figure 2 ), which is corresponding to known agonist binding of P2 ( Zhang et al,2014 ). The score of UDP-G is –9.3 kcal, and that of UDP –8.5 kcal, indicating both UDP and UDPlc bind P2. Compared the UDP-bound model ( Figure 2 ) the UDP-G model showed interactions between the glucose and TM, TM, TM, and ECL of P ( Figure 2 ) enhancing the binding UDPlc. Based these docking models we decomposed ligand-binding to each residue ( Figure 2 ) Five residues K.60, D.64, N.21,170, ICL, and E36 were predicted to stabilize UDPlc ( Figure 2 and ) while made few contributions van der Waals energy >0.25 Rosetta unit to UDP ( Figure ) As in Figure 2 and, two subpockets of P were unveiled for ligand binding The sub 1 is formed 16 of TM– and ECL ( Figure 2, Figure 2— supplement 1, B ) and binds the nucleotide moi of agon, that is UDP The sub 2 the sugar site involving K., D, N, I, and E ( Figure 2 and ) are primarily charged or polar amino acids which made hydrogen bonds the hydroxyl groups UDPlc ( Figure 2 ) To validate proposed sugar sites we designed single-point mutations these residues K, D, N, I, and E Among mutants D significantly reduced UDPlc compared WT ( Figure ) However, substitution D did not affect receptor UDP ( Figure suggesting D is not crucial UDP binding In contrast mutations K and E significantly reduced UDP ( Figure indicating K and E are important UDP binding To the conserved nature sugar motif we employed P purino 12 P which shares amino identity P and not reported activated anyotide (son et al 202 Rvic and199 ) found UDP and UDP potently P with EC values 50.9 6.1 nM 40.3.5 nM ( Figure ) indicating cons motif is functional both P and P To validate cons we UDP and UDP agonists ( Figure ) Both potently P with EC 50

    Title: 
    Article: Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts, NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development. 
 Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) possess the remarkable ability to self-renew for maintaining their identity and differentiate into diverse neural cell types required for neurogenesis during brain development. The self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation of NSCs are regulated by both intrinsic programs inside stem cells and extrinsic cues from the surrounding niches. The mammalian NSC niche found in the neurogenic regions is composed of diverse cell types including choroid plexus, vascular endothelia cells, pericytes, microglia, and meninges, which regulate NSC behaviors such as proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation ( Bjornsson et al., 2015 ). The diversity and complexity of these cell populations confer niche the ability to integrate local and systemic signals, but make it complicated to study the interaction between niches and NSCs in mammals, which is a critical issue in understanding neurogenesis and improving clinical applications of NSCs. Drosophila larval central nervous system ( CNS ), composed of the central brain ( CB ), optic lobe ( OL ), and ventral nerve cord ( VNC ), is a simple but sophisticated model to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying NSC behaviors mediated by niche signals. In this system, Drosophila NSCs, called NBs, and their progenies are encased by a variety of glial cells including perineurial glia, subperineurial glia, cortex glia, astrocyte-like glia and ensheathing glia ( Hartenstein, 2011; Ito et al., 1995; Pereanu et al., 2005 ). These glial cells not only form the physical support structure for NBs, but also provide extrinsic cues that regulate NB reactivation, survival, and proliferation ( Read, 2018; Spéder and Brand, 2014 ). However, it remains elusive whether the glial-cell-forming niche is involved in the regulation of the prominent characteristics of NBs, self-renewal, and differentiation. Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms since it participates in many crucial biological processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that both support ATP production used for most cellular activities. High levels of iron are found in many organs including the brain, where iron is required for myelination and formation of neuronal dendritic trees ( Lozoff et al., 2006; Möller et al., 2019; Rice and Barone, 2000 ). Iron deficiency in infants and early childhood has been well-documented to be associated with long-term cognitive, social, and emotional problems ( Fretham et al., 2011 ). Thus, it is intriguing to investigate whether iron is also required in NSCs during neurogenesis. Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein present in most organisms, is composed of 24 subunits that assemble into a hollow-sphere complex capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms in a bioavailable form ( Andrews, 2005; Knovich et al., 2009 ). Ferritin in both mammals and insects is a heteropolymer, consisting of heavy and light chain homolog subunits. In Drosophila, these subunits are encoded by ferritin 1 heavy chain homolog ( Fer1HCH ) and ferritin 2 light chain homolog ( Fer2LCH ), respectively ( Arosio et al., 2009; Pham and Winzerling, 2010 ), which both contain secretion signal peptides that direct them to the ER during translation ( Lind et al., 1998 ). Consequently, Drosophila ferritin is confined to the secretory pathway and abundant in the hemolymph ( Nichol et al., 2002 ). Ferritin or iron manipulation in Drosophila glia regulates the adult behavior, such as locomotion ( Kosmidis et al., 2011; Navarro et al., 2015 ). Previous researches have shown that Drosophila ferritin not only directly participates in dietary iron absorption by removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane, but competes with transferrin to deliver iron between the gut and the fat body ( Tang and Zhou, 2013; Xiao et al., 2019 ). These findings underscore the pivotal role of ferritin in iron transport. Interestingly, iron-loaded ferritin, serving as an essential mitogen, promotes proliferation of cultured Drosophila cells ( Li, 2010 ). Therefore, it is tempting to investigate whether ferritin is required for self-renewal and the proliferation of NSCs during brain development. Here, we show that glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to form iron-sulfur ( Fe-S ) clusters, which is necessary for the production of ATP, providing the energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs, highlighting ferritin as a potential target for suppressing tumor. 
 To identify new niche factors involved in the balance between NB self-renewal and differentiation, we used repo-GAL4 to perform an RNAi-mediated screen in glial cells. Fer1HCH and Fer2LCH, two ferritin subunit encoding genes, were identified to be essential for NB maintenance and brain development. Specifically, knocking down Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH in glial cells significantly reduced the number of NBs in the CB and VNC at the third-instar larval stage, which resulted in decreased size of the CNS ( Figure 1A and B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). To further assess the impact on NB proliferation, we employed the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3 ( PH3 ) and the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine ( EdU ), revealing a substantial decrease in the proliferation rate of NBs upon glial ferritin knockdown ( Figure 1A and C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C ). These results indicated that glial ferritin is required for maintaining NBs and their proliferation. To identify the glial subpopulation in which ferritin functions, we employed subtype-restricted GAL4 to perform ferritin knockdowns ( Table 1 ). We observed that knocking down ferritin genes in cortex glia led to a similar yet milder phenotype compared to that observed in the pan-glia knockdown ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ). This milder effect may be attributed to potential compensatory mechanisms from other glial subpopulations. Interestingly, knocking down ferritin in other glial subtypes did not yield any discernible phenotype ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). These findings suggest that ferritin functions collectively across all glial populations to regulate the activity of NBs. We confirmed the phenotype with multiple independent RNAi lines for Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH, and observed similar abnormalities of larval NBs and brain development ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ). Hereafter, UAS-Fer1HCH-RNAi ( THU5585 ) and UAS-Fer2LCH-RNAi ( TH01861. N ) were used for most studies, and we only quantified NB number and proliferation rate in the CB for convenience in this research. To evaluate the efficiency of RNAi for Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH, RT-PCR was performed with total RNA isolated from the whole brain dissected from third-instar larvae. The abundance of Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH mRNA was significantly reduced in glial Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH knockdown, respectively ( Figure 1D and E ). Western blot analysis of larval brain protein extract using polyclonal antibodies against Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH further confirmed that both subunits were down-regulated in glial knockdown of either subunit ( Figure 1F–I ), consistent with previous research in Drosophila ( Missirlis et al., 2007 ). To exclude the possibility of RNAi off-target effects, we used repo-GAL4 to overexpress RNAi-resistant Fer1HCH ( or Fer2LCH ) containing silent mutations in the region targeted by shRNA, which resulted in a significant increase in the number and proliferation rate of NBs compared to glial ferritin knockdown ( Figure 1J and Figure 1— supplement 3 ). These results demonstrate that glial ferritin is required for the self-renew and proliferation of NBs. To investigate the molecular basis of ferritin function, we examined the activity of aconitase and NAD+ levels in glial ferritin knockdown NBs. aconase is a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle that generates NAD+, which is essential for ATP production. aconase activity was significantly reduced in glial ferritin knockdown NB ( Figure 2A and B ), consistent with decreased NAD+ levels ( Figure 2C ). These findings suggest that ferritin supplies iron for aconase to produce NAD+, which is necessary for NB self-renew and proliferation. To determine the role of NAD in NB selfnew, we employed the NAD+ donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) to rescue the phenotype of glial ferritin knockdown ( Figure 2D and Figure 2— supplement ). NAD supplementation restored the number and proliferation of NBs in glial ferritin knockdown ( Figure 2E and Figure 2— supplement ), indicating that NAD is essential for NB selfnew and proliferation. To further investigate the mechanism of ferritin in NB, we examined the expression of Prospero (Prosper ), a transcription factor required for NB differentiation. Pros was upregulated in glial ferritin knockdown NB ( Figure 2F and Figure 2— supplement ), consistent with premature differentiation of NB. These results suggest that ferritin regulates the balance between selfnew and differentiation of NB by modulating acon activity and N+ levels. To investigate the potential of ferritin as a tumor suppressor, we examined the effect of ferritin overexpression on NB proliferation. Overexpression of FerH or FerL in gl cells significantly reduced the number and proliferation of NB ( Figure 3A and Figure 3— supplement ), indicating that ferritin acts as a tumor suppressor. To evaluate the level of ferritin production in response to NB status, we examined the expression of FerH and FerL in glial cells. FerH and FerL were upregulated in response to increased NB ( Figure 3B and 3 ) and downregulated in response to decreased NB ( Figure 3 and 3 ). These findings suggest that glial ferr production is regulated by the status of NB, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that glial ferritin supplies iron to NB for acon to produce NAD, which is necessary for selfnew and proliferation of NB, highlighting ferritin as a potential tumor suppressor. This study reveals a novel role of the glial niche in regulating the selfnew and differentiation of NB during brain development.

    Title: 
    Article: Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US. We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data. Nationally in 2020, MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13, 600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2–7% ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic, 0–1% ). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37% ) and Alzheimer’s ( 19% ). To understand these differences, we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. 
 The dominant risk factors for COVID-19 mortality have consistently been shown to be advanced age, male gender, and certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease ( Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022; Rüthrich et al., 2021; Williamson et al., 2020 ). Cancer has also been identified as a high-risk condition based on case-control and cohort studies, although these studies have provided conflicting results. In a large cohort study of ~500, 000 COVID-19 inpatients, only cancer patients under recent treatment were at increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths ( OR = 1. 7 ) relative to non-cancer patients ( Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022 ). Conversely, a smaller European study of 3000 COVID-19 inpatients found that cancer was not a risk factor ( Rüthrich et al., 2021 ), as did an international, multicenter study of 4000 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients ( Raad et al., 2023 ). More recently a meta-analysis of 35 studies from Europe, North America, and Asia found a twofold increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among cancer patients ( Di Felice et al., 2022 ). Similarly, a large analysis from the UK found that the risk of COVID-19 mortality for cancer patients had declined over the course of the pandemic but remained 2. 5 times higher than for non-cancer patients into 2022 ( Starkey et al., 2023 ). Taken together, such observational studies provide a mixed picture of cancer as a COVID-19 mortality risk factor, with several studies reporting that controlling for important factors such as age is a challenge. Furthermore, cancer is often considered as a single disease category despite the diversity of conditions and patients represented. Further evidence for the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 comes from population-level analysis of vital statistics. A recent US study showed no elevation in underlying cancer deaths concomitant with COVID-19 waves, in stark contrast to the sharp rise in mortality from other chronic diseases ( Lee et al., 2023a ). In several other countries, including Sweden, Italy, Latvia, Brazil, England, and Wales, underlying cancer mortality was found to be stable or decreasing during the first year of the pandemic ( Alicandro et al., 2023; Fernandes et al., 2021; Gobiņa et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2022; Kontopantelis et al., 2022; Lundberg et al., 2023 ). Further, an excess mortality study of 240, 000 cancer patients in Belgium found a 33% rise in mortality in April 2020, but concluded that this was no different from the rise observed in the general population ( Silversmit et al., 2021 ). The apparent lack of association between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population-level raises the question of the true relationship between cancer and COVID-19. The relationship between these two diseases could occur via multiple biological mechanisms. First, immunosuppression in cancer patients could increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or risk of severe clinical outcome upon infection. Conversely, immunosuppression could act as a protective factor in the face of a severe respiratory infection that kills by over-stimulating the immune system – the immune incompetence rescue hypothesis ( Reichert et al., 2004 ). This hypothesis was put forward to explain the observed absence in excess cancer mortality during the 1968 influenza pandemic, a departure from elevated mortality seen for other high-risk conditions such as heart disease and diabetes ( Reichert et al., 2004 ). A further mechanism that could affect the observed relationship between cancer deaths and COVID-19 is changing guidelines for establishing the primary cause of death. Coding guidelines evolved throughout the pandemic as testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection became more widespread, which presumably affected vital statistics studies. To further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level, we analyzed US vital statistics in detail to understand the potential role of death certificate coding changes during the pandemic and explored putative differences in mortality patterns between different types of cancer. We considered death certificates listing cancer as the underlying cause ( UC ) of death or anywhere on the death certificate ( multiple cause [MC] ). Assuming there is a high propensity to attribute a primary code of COVID-19 during the pandemic in any patient with COVID-19, deaths among individuals with both cancer and COVID-19 near the time of death would be coded as UC COVID-19. However, cancer should still be captured in the MC data, and thus, analysis of MC death data should control for any changes in death certificate coding practices during the pandemic ( Fedeli et al., 2024 ). The US provides a particularly useful case study as the timing of COVID-19 waves varied considerably between states, so that elevations in cancer deaths, should they exist, should also be heterogeneous. For comparison, we also assessed population-level excess mortality patterns for other chronic conditions such as diabetes, ischemic heart disease ( IHD ), kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s, for which the association with COVID-19 is less debated. 
 We obtained individual ICD-10-coded death certificate data from the US for the period January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020. We compiled time series by week and cause of death, for UC and for MC mortality. We considered 10 causes of death, including diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, IHD, kidney disease, and six types of cancer ( all-cause cancer, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, lung, and hematological; see Table 1 and Appendix 1—table 1 for a list of disease codes ). We chose these specific cancers to illustrate conditions for which the 5-year survival rate is low ( 13% and 25%, respectively, for pancreatic and lung cancers ) and high ( 65% and 91%, respectively, for colorectal and breast cancers ) ( National Cancer Institute, 2024 ). Hematological cancer ( 67% 5-year survival rate ) was included because it has been singled out as a risk factor in several previous studies due to the immune suppression associated with both its malignancy and treatment ( Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022; Han et al., 2022a; Rüthrich et al., 2021; Williamson et al., 2020 ). To compare mortality patterns with the timing of COVID-19 pandemic waves, we accessed national- and state-level counts of reported COVID-19 cases from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022. In national data, time series of COVID-19-coded death certificates ( both UC and MC ) tracked with the temporal patterns of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases ( Figure 1 ), revealing three distinct COVID-19 waves: a spring wave peaking on April 12, 2020, a smaller summer wave peaking on July 26, 2020, and a large winter wave that had not yet peaked by the end of the study in December 2020. This correspondence between COVID-19 case and death activity represents a ‘signature’ mortality pattern of COVID-19. Analysis of state-level data reveals variable timing, intensity, and number of COVID-19 waves across the US during 2020. To focus on periods with substantial COVID-19 activity and explore the association with cancer, we identified three large US states with unique, well-defined waves ( Figure 1 ). New York ( NY ) state experienced a large, early wave in March–May 2020, based on recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths and high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this period ( over 20%; Stadlbauer et al., 2021 ). Meanwhile, California ( CA ) experienced a large COVID-19 wave at the end of the year and had little activity during the spring and summer. Finally, Texas ( TX ) had two large waves; one during the spring and a smaller in the fall. We selected these three states for detailed analysis because of their distinct patterns of COVID-19 activity. We analyzed UC and MC death data for these states for the period January 1, 2019 to December 31,2020 to examine the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19. We calculated excess mortality for each cause of death by comparing the number of deaths in 2020 to the 5-year baseline (2015–2019 ). Excess mortality was calculated as the difference between the observed and expected number of deaths, with the expected based on the 5-year average annual rate. We also calculated the proportion of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 by comparing the number of deaths with COVID-19 listed as UC or MC to the total number of deaths for each cause in 202. We found that cancer mortality rose by 3% in 202 compared to the 5-year baseline, corresponding to approximately 13,600 excess deaths ( Table 2 ). Mortality was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast, colorectal, and hematological 2–7% ) than for cancers with poor survival ( lung and pancreatic 0–1 ). In contrast, there was a substantial elevation in deaths from diabetes (37% ) and Alzheimer’s (19 ). To understand these differences, we simulated the expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals with each condition. We found that the mortality differences are primarily explained by life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. The risk factors for COVID-19 have been consistently shown to be age, gender, and chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease ( Chavez-MGregor et al,202; Rüth et al,202; Williamson et al,202 ). Cancer has been identified as a high-risk based on case-control and cohort studies, although results have been conflicting. A large study of ~500,000 COVID-19 inpatients found that cancer patients under treatment were at increased risk of COVID-19 deaths ( OR 1.7 ) relative to non-cancer patients ( Chavez-MGregor et,202 ). Conversely, a smaller study of 300 COVID-19 inpatients found that cancer was not a risk ( Rürich et,202 ) as an international multicenter of 400 COVID-19 in ( Ra,202 ). A meta-analysis of 35 studies from Europe, North, and Asia found a twofold increased risk of COVID-19 among cancer patients ( Diice et,202 ). A large from the UK found the risk of COVID-19 for cancer patients declined over the pandemic but remained 2.5 higher for non-cancer into 202 (key et,202 ) Taken, observational studies provide a mixed picture of cancer as a COVID-19 risk, with controlling age a challenge. Furthermore, cancer is considered a single category despite diversity of patients. Further evidence the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 comes from population analysis of vital statistics. A study showed no elevation in cancer concomitant with COVID-19, in contrast to rise from other chronic ( Lee et,202a ) In several countries, including Sweden, Italy, Latvia, Brazil, England, Wales, cancer mortality was stable or decreasing during pandemic ( Alic et,202; Fernandes et, Fernandes et, Gņa et, Grande et Kontantel et Lund,202 ) An excess of 240, cancer in Belgium found 33 rise in April but concluded no different rise in general ( Silmit, ) The lack association between cancer and COVID-19 on population raises question the relationship between these diseases The relationship could occur multiple mechanisms First, immunosup in cancer increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV and risk severe outcome infection Conversely, immunup act

    Title: 
    Article: The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture —the Smc5/6 complex— plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. 
 The maintenance of genome stability is a primordial function that ensures the proper development and homeostasis of all living organisms ( Negrini et al., 2010; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Lengauer et al., 1997; Cifone and Fidler, 1981 ). Successful maintenance of genomic integrity requires constant monitoring and repair of DNA lesions because genomes are under constant attack from endogenous sources of DNA damage ( Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017; Thada and Greenberg, 2022; Lindahl and Nyberg, 1972 ). One of the most common sources of endogenous DNA damage is the formation of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in chromosomes. During transcription, nascent RNA transcripts can re-anneal to complementary DNA strands producing an RNA-DNA hybrid and displace the template strand, creating an obstacle to the progression of the DNA replication machinery. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid and displaced ssDNA segment —together termed the R-loop— are highly deleterious for genome integrity ( Chatzidoukaki et al., 2021; Costantino and Koshland, 2018; De Magis et al., 2019; Stork et al., 2016 ). RNA-DNA hybrid structures can also be formed under a variety of physiological conditions in eukaryotic genomes and play important roles in cell physiology and regulate genome dynamics. Common physiological roles of RNA-DNA hybrids include immunoglobulin class switching recombination of B cells in vertebrates ( Yu et al., 2003; Roy et al., 2008 ), mitochondrial DNA replication ( Pohjoismäki et al., 2010; Xu and Clayton, 1996 ), bacterial plasmid replication ( Baker and Kornberg, 1988; McLean et al., 2022 ), and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing ( Zhang et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2017 ). Moreover, RNA-DNA hybrids co-ordinate specific regulatory steps in transcription initiation and termination ( Sidorenkov et al., 1998; Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011; Nudler et al., 1997 ), telomere homeostasis ( Balk et al., 2013; Luke et al., 2008 ), and gene expression ( Crossley et al., 2019; García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019; Brambati et al., 2020; Niehrs and Luke, 2020; Zardoni et al., 2021 ). However, the formation of unprogrammed or non-physiological RNA-DNA hybrid structures can interfere with DNA replication-related processes, resulting in replicative stress and the formation of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) ( Crossley et al., 2019; Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012; Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015; Hamperl et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2024 ). Importantly, exposed ssDNA in the R-loop can be cleaved by different endonucleases leading to DNA breaks and/or mutagenic events, and can also adopt harmful secondary structures ( Freudenreich, 2018; Miglietta et al., 2020 ). R-loop-induced DNA damage and genomic rearrangements have been linked to various disease states in humans. Examples include trinucleotide repeat-associated diseases, auto-immune disorders, neurological disorders, and cancer, although it is not currently known whether R-loops play a causative or consequential role in such diseases ( García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019; Richard and Manley, 2017 ). To mitigate the toxic consequences associated with the presence of unprogrammed RNA-DNA hybrids in chromosomes, several cellular mechanisms work in concert to prevent their formation, and when they do accumulate, remove them from eukaryotic genomes. For instance, the Ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) family of enzymes plays a central role in degrading the RNA moiety of R-loops created under a variety of genomic conditions ( Lazzaro et al., 2012; Lockhart et al., 2019; Figure 1A ). Recently, it was shown that the RNase DICER can also cleave the RNA moiety of the R-loops in higher eukaryotes ( Camino et al., 2023 ). In addition, factors associated with transcription and mRNA biogenesis, RNA-DNA helicases, topoisomerases, chromatin remodelers, and several DNA repair enzymes are known to be involved alongside RNase H in preventing the accumulation of R-loop structures in eukaryotic chromosomes ( García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019 ). However, a definitive understanding of the sequence of events and exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the repair of R-loops/RNA-DNA hybrids remains to be established. Work from our laboratory and other researchers provides hints of a possible involvement of structural maintenance of chromosomes ( SMC ) -type complexes in RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism ( Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017; Serrano et al., 2020; Girasol et al., 2023; Penzo et al., 2023 ). SMC complexes are effectors of large-scale changes in chromosome organization and include three evolutionarily conserved enzyme complexes: condensin, cohesin, and the Smc5/6 complex ( Peng and Zhao, 2023 ). The Smc5/6 complex is a particularly intriguing member of this family because its function —unlike that of cohesin and condensin— is primarily concerned with DNA repair, and yet its exact contribution to this process is not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that the Smc5/6 complex is a DNA compacting enzyme that acts in vivo by regulating local chromatin domains containing unusual DNA structures that can lead to replication stress and/or DNA damage ( Serrano et al., 2020; Gutierrez-Escribano et al., 2020; Tanasie et al., 2022; Pradhan et al., 2023 ). Interestingly, genome-wide screens as well as targeted genetic analyses revealed synthetic interactions among a subset of mutants affecting Smc5/6 complex components and RNA-DNA hybrid detoxification enzymes ( Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017; Costanzo et al., 2016; Styles et al., 2016; Kuzmin et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019 ). Consistent with this, we have previously shown that the Smc5/6 complex can bind to short RNA-DNA duplexes with high affinity and specificity ( Serrano et al., 2020 ). Together, these results raise the intriguing possibility that the Smc5/6 complex might be involved in the detection and/or processing of toxic R-loops formed in eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions. In particular, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. Our results unravel a hitherto unanticipated role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of RNA structures from chromosomes, an essential function for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fitness. 
 In eukaryotes, two partially overlapping enzymes mediate the degradation of R-loops; RNase H1 and RNase H2 ( Figure 1A; Lazzaro et al., 2012; Lockhart et al., 2019 ). To determine whether the Smc5/6 complex contributes to R-loop repair in proliferating cells, we introduced the smc6-9 and nse4-4 alleles of the Smc5/6 complex ( Figure 1B ) into budding yeast strains defective for RNase H1 ( rnh1Δ ) and RNase H2 ( rnh201Δ/rh2 ), respectively. We found that the sm6-9 and n4 mutants exhibited synthetic interactions with rnhΔ and r201/r2, indicating that the Sm5/6 complex is required for the removal of R-lo in the absence of RNase1 and RNase2 ( Figure 2A ). Moreover, the sm-9 and n4 mutants accumulated high levels of RNA-DNA hybrids in their chromosomes ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that the Sm5/6 complex is necessary for the removal of R-lo in the absence of RNase and RN2. To investigate the role of the Sm5/ complex in R-loop repair in more directly, we assayed the ability of the Sm/6 complex to bind to RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro. We found that the Sm/6 binds to RNA-DNA with high affinity and specificity ( Figure 3A ), consistent with our previous results ( Serr et al. 2020 ). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Sm/6 promotes the degradation of the RNA moiety of R-lo by RNase2 in vitro ( Figure 3B ). These results indicate that the Sm/6 acts as a mediator of RNase2 in the degradation of the RNA component of R-lo. To determine whether the Sm/6 is involved in the removal of R-lo in vivo, we assayed the ability of the Sm/ to bind to RNA-DNA in living cells. We found that the Sm/ binds to RNA-DNA in vivo ( Figure 4A ) and promotes the degradation of the RNA moi of-lo by RNase2 ( Figure 4B ). Together, our results show that the Sm/ complex plays a crucial role in the removal of R-lo formed during gene transcription and telomere homeasis in eukary genomes. The Sm/ complex acts as a mediator of RN2 in the degradation of the RNA moi of-lo and is necessary for the removal of R-lo in the absence of RN1 and RN2. Our findings reveal a hith unanticipated function of the Sm/ complex in the removal of R-lo and highlight the importance of this complex in the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fitness.

    Title: 
    Article: Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing. To this end, the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering. Is such a compensatory brain–behaviour link longitudinally stable? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour? We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39–82 y ). First, despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y. Second, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1, T2 ). Longitudinally, however, our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies. 
 Speech comprehension is an essential aspect of human communication, enabling us to understand and interact with others effectively. Preserved communication is therefore critical to social well-being and healthy ageing ( Lindenberger, 2014 ). Any translational advance aimed at maintaining and restoring successful cognitive ageing crucially relies on understanding the factors that explain and predict individual trajectories of listening performance. However, the evidence on these potential factors is astonishingly limited. As we age, our ability to comprehend speech can decline due to age-related changes in the auditory system ( i. e. sensory acuity ) and in cognitive resources. Age-related hearing loss reduces the ability to detect and discriminate speech sounds, especially in noisy environments. However, it has long been recognised that increasing age and hearing loss cannot fully account for the considerable degree of inter-individual differences observed in listening behaviour and its lifespan change ( Akeroyd, 2008; Houtgast and Festen, 2008; Humes et al., 2012 ). Recent research has focused on the neurobiological mechanisms that promote successful speech comprehension by implementing ‘neural filters’ that segregate behaviourally relevant from irrelevant sounds. Such neural filter mechanisms act by selectively increasing the sensory gain for behaviourally relevant inputs or by inhibiting the processing of irrelevant inputs ( Cherry, 1953; Broadbent, 1958; Wöstmann et al., 2020 ). A growing body of evidence suggests that speech comprehension is neurally supported by an attention-guided filter mechanism that modulates sensory gain and arises from primary auditory and perisylvian brain regions: by synchronising its neural activity with the temporal structure of the speech signal of interest, the brain ‘tracks’ and thereby better encodes behaviourally relevant auditory inputs to enable attentive listening ( Ding and Simon, 2012; Zion Golumbic et al., 2013; Obleser and Kayser, 2019; Lakatos et al., 2008 ). In a large age-varying cohort ( N = 155; 39–80 y ), we have previously shown how the fidelity of this neural filtering strategy can help explain differences in listening behaviour ( i ) from individual to individual and ( ii ) within individuals from sentence to sentence ( Tune et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2015; Mesgarani and Chang, 2012 ). As participants performed a challenging dual-talker listening task, we recorded their electroencephalogram ( EEG ). We observed that enhanced neural filtering—defined as stronger neural tracking of attended vs. ignored speech—led to more accurate and overall faster responses. Notably, we observed both neural filtering as well as its link to behaviour to be independent of chronological age and severity of hearing loss ( Tune et al., 2021; Figure 1A ). The observation of such brain–behaviour relationships critically advances our understanding of the neurobiological foundation of cognitive functioning by showing, for example, how neural implementations of auditory selective attention support attentive listening. They also provide fruitful ground for scientific inquiries into the translational potential of neural markers. However, the potency of neural markers to predict future behavioural outcomes is often only implicitly assumed but seldom put to the test ( Woo et al., 2017 ). Using auditory cognition as a model system, we here aim to overcome this limitation by testing directly the hitherto unknown longitudinal stability of neural filtering as a neural compensatory mechanism upholding communication success. Going further, we ask to what extent an individual’s attentional neural-filtering ability measured at a given moment is able to predict their future trajectory in listening performance. Only if this is the case, and only if such an association can plausibly be assumed to be causal for future changes in communication ability, neural filtering would be a potential translational target. We here aim to fill this gap by analysing 2-year changes in the sensory, neural, and behavioural domain in a longitudinal subsample ( N = 105; 39–82 y ) of the original AUDADAPT cohort ( Tune et al., 2021; Figure 2A ). We apply a combination of advanced cross-sectional and longitudinal modelling strategies to address the following specific research questions ( Figure 1 ). First, by focusing on each domain individually, we ask how sensory, neural, and behavioural functioning evolve cross-sectionally across the middle and older adult lifespan ( Figure 1B ). More importantly, we also ask how they change longitudinally across the studied 2-year period ( Figure 1C, Q1 ), and whether ageing individuals differ significantly in their degree of change ( Q2 ). We expect individuals’ hearing acuity and behaviour to decrease from T1 to T2. Since we previously observed inter-individual differences in neural filtering to be independent of age and hearing status, we did not expect any systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering. Second, we test the longitudinal stability of the previously observed age- and hearing-loss-independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed ( Figure 1A ). To this end, we analyse the multivariate direct and indirect relationships of hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening behaviour within and across timepoints. Third, leveraging the strengths of latent change score modelling ( LCSM ) ( McArdle, 2009; Kievit et al., 2018 ), we fuse cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives to probe the role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural change in two different ways: we ask whether an individual’s T1 neural filtering strength can predict the observed behavioural longitudinal change ( Q3 ), and whether 2-year change in neural filtering can explain concurrent change in listening behaviour ( Q4 ). Here, irrespective of the observed magnitude and direction of T1–T2 developments, two scenarios are conceivable: Intra-individual neural and behavioural change may be either be correlated—lending support to a compensatory role of neural filtering—or instead follow independent trajectories ( Oschwald et al., 2019; Figure 1C ). Answering these questions is vital for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of successful communication across the lifespan. Answering them will also critically inform the development of interventions targeted at maintaining or restoring communication success and therefore concerns basic and applied researchers alike. 
 In a first analysis ( Figure 3 ), we characterised how hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance change across the middle to older adult lifespan. Additionally, we analysed longitudinal change from timepoint 1 ( T1 ) to timepoint 2 ( T2 ). We used the same linear mixed-effect models to test cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time. We additionally quantified each measure’s test–retest reliability as their T1–T2 Pearson’s correlation. Note that throughout the article and all analyses, we reversed the sign of pure-tone average ( PTA ) values to express them as an index of hearing acuity rather than hearing loss ( i. e. higher values indicating better acuity ). Similarly, for more intuitive interpretation, accuracy is visually presented as mean proportion correct but was logit-transformed for all statistical analyses to satisfy model assumptions. As expected, hearing acuity decreased linearly with increasing age ( Figure 3A, β = –3. 4, standard error [SE] = 0. 71, p<0. 001 ) and on average by 1. 2 dB from T1 to T2 ( β = –1. 18, SE = 0. 27, p<0. 001; meanT1: –13. 72 dB HL [SD: 7. 8]; meanT2: –14. 90 dB HL [8. 3] ). The effect of age did not change with time ( age × timepoint β = –0. 35, SE = 0. 28, p=0. 21 ). Assuming constant individual progression rates, this observed change corresponds to a projected average decrease in hearing acuity per decade of –6. 3 ( SD: 15. 3 ) dB HL ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). The magnitude of observed and projected hearing loss progression is well in line with recent large-sample reports ( Linssen et al., 2014; Rigters et al., 2018; Wiley et al., 2008 ). Measurements of hearing acuity showed high test–retest reliability ( r = 0. 94, p<0. 001 ), underscoring the high fidelity of our audiological assessment. In line with known deleterious effects of age on hearing, listening performance also decreased with age ( Figure 3, β = – 0.3, SE 0., p< 0.001 ) and on average by 2. 5 from T1 to T2 ( β – 0.2, SE 0.,< 0.001 ; meanT1: 0.6 ; meanT: –0.8 ). The effect of age did not change time ( age × time β –0., SE 0,= 0. 0 ). Assuming constant progression, this corresponds to an average decrease in listening performance per decade of –.5 ( SD 1. 1 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) The magnitude of observed and projected loss is in line with previous reports ( Humes et al. 2012; Aoyd et al. 2008 ). Listening showed high test–test reliability ( r 0.94,< 0.001 ). In contrast to hearing and listening, neural filtering did not change with age ( Figure 3, β 0., SE 0,= 0 0. ) or from T1 to T2 ( β 0, SE 0, 0 0 ). The effect of age did not time ( age × time 0, SE 0, 0= 0. ). Thus, filtering remained stable over the 2 -year period and across the middle to older lifespan ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Notably, filtering showed high test–test reliability ( r 0.96,< 0.001 ), indicating robustness of the neural measure. In the second analysis ( Figure 4 ), we examined the relationship between neural and behaviour at each timepoint T1 and T2. As expected, we found significant correlations between neural and behaviour at both T1 ( r 0.5, p<.001 ) and T2 ( 0.5,<.001 ). However, these correlations were only observed within each timepoint and not longitudinally across T1–T ( r 0, 0 0. ). This suggests that neural and behaviour follow independent trajectories. In the third analysis ( Figure 5 ), we tested whether T1 neural filtering can predict T2 change in behaviour and vice versa. Using LCSM, we found that neither T1 filtering nor 2-year change in filtering could predict 2-year change in behaviour ( Figure 5 ). This indicates that neural filtering is not a longitudinal predictor of individual change in listening. We also found no evidence that 2-year change in filtering could explain concurrent change in behaviour ( Figure 5 ). This suggests that filtering is not a precursor to change in listening. Our results raise caution against the use of neural metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour. In conclusion, we show that listening and filtering follow largely independent trajectories over the middle to older lifespan. Despite expected decline in hearing acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. Longitudinally, neural and behaviour were correlated within each timepoint but not across timepoints. Our findings suggest that filtering is not a compensatory mechanism for age-related loss in sensory acuity and therefore not a predictor of individual change in listening behaviour. This has implications for the development of interventions aimed at maintaining and restoring communication in ageing.

    Title: 
    Article: The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis ), here also referred to as chemosensation, enables animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins. Humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines, yet the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood. Here, we generate tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and apply phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities as well as particular tastes and flavours can predict ancient Graeco-Roman drug use. We found chemosensation to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use: botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours, and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to the common notion of bitter tasting medicines, we also found starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs associated with versatility. In ancient Greece and Rome, illness was thought to arise from imbalance in bodily fluids or humours, yet our study suggests that uses of drugs were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology. 
 ‘A bitter pill to swallow’ is just one of many common idioms referring to the taste of medicine, which from ancient to early modern times has relied mostly on botanical drugs ( Touwaide, 2022 ). In ancient Greece and Rome, the expected effects of botanical drugs were explained by their taste ( Jones, 1959; Einarson and Link, 1990; Jouanna, 2012 ) and according to the prevailing medical theory, disease resulted from a disequilibrium between bodily fluids or humours including phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black bile; drugs affected the flow and balance of these humours ( Jones, 1959; King, 2013 ). Theophrastus ( 300 BCE ) attributed sweet the capacity to smoothen, astringent with the power to desiccate and solidify, pungent with the capacity to cut or to separate out the heat, salty with desiccating and irritating properties, and bitter with the capacity to melt and irritate ( Einarson and Link, 1990 ). Other systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, continue to classify materia medica according to tastes and flavours ( Dragos and Gilca, 2018; Shou-zhong, 1998 ), and indigenous societies use chemosensory qualities to select botanical drugs ( Casagrande, 2000; Leonti et al., 2002; Shepard, 2004 ). The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis ), here also referred to as chemosensation, has evolved to meet nutritional requirements and is particularly important in omnivores for seeking out nutrients and avoiding toxins ( Rozin and Todd, 2016; Breslin, 2013; Glendinning, 2022 ). The rejection of bitter stimuli has generally been associated with the avoidance of toxins ( Glendinning, 1994; Lindemann, 2001; Breslin, 2013 ) but to date no clear relationship between bitter compounds and toxicity at a nutritionally relevant dose could be established ( Glendinning, 1994; Nissim et al., 2017 ). While bitter tasting metabolites occurring in fruits and vegetables have been linked with a lower risk for contracting cancer and cardiovascular diseases ( Drewnowski and Gomez-Carneros, 2000 ), the avoidance of pharmacologically active compounds is probably the reason why many medicines, including botanical drugs, taste bitter ( Johns, 1990; Mennella et al., 2013 ). Botanical drugs are chemically complex and often used for a range of different health problems ( Wagner et al., 2007 ). Chemical complexity determines pharmacological complexity, since different chemicals interact with different targets ( Gertsch, 2011 ), and influence taste complexity and intensity ( Spence and Wang, 2018; Breslin and Beauchamp, 1997; Green et al., 2010 ). Today, some associations between chemosensory qualities and therapeutic uses, such as bitter-tasting botanical drugs for stomach problems or astringent ones for diarrhoea, are still recognised in Western herbal medicine ( Wagner et al., 2007 ). These observations establish a role for chemosensory qualities in medicine. Yet, taste and flavour are largely irrelevant to modern medicine, aside from the pharmaceutical industry looking for ways to mask bad tastes ( Mennella et al., 2013 ). Whether ancient systems of traditional medicine could be relevant to modern science is questionable. The theory of humours was the principal underlying the concept of Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age, but as an entirely discredited theory it might be expected that associated practices also lack scientific basis. However, we propose that taste and flavour perception of botanical drugs links humoral theory to modern medicine. We hypothesise that chemosensation and underlying physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology co-explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times. We further hypothesise that associations between perceived complexity and intensity of chemosensory qualities of botanical drugs and their versatility ( number of categories of therapeutic use a botanical drug is recommended for ) provide insights into the development of empirical pharmacological knowledge and therapeutic behaviour. If tastes and flavours, as determined by a modern-day tasting panel, do predict uses as recorded in ancient texts, this would be an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation in combination with physiological effects guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times. To test these hypotheses, we assessed the relationships between chemosensory qualities, their intensity, and complexity with therapeutic uses of botanical drugs described in Pedanios Dioscorides’ pharmacognostic compendium, De Materia Medica ( DMM; Matthioli, 1970; Staub et al., 2016 ), the foremost pharmaceutical source of antiquity. DMM compiles knowledge on the sourcing, preparation, and therapeutic consensus of botanical drugs traded and used in the Eastern Mediterranean region of the Roman Empire during the first century CE ( Riddle, 1985 ). We collected 700 botanical drugs described in DMM ( Supplementary file 1 ) and used quality descriptors to represent chemosensation by a trained tasting panel scoring each botanical drug for presence and intensity of each quality ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 2 and 3 ). We arranged the botanical drugs into therapeutic uses according to affected organs, therapeutic functions, diseases, and symptoms as indicated in DMM, and into broader and more inclusive categories of therapeutic use ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 1 and 4 ). By applying phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models ( PGLMMs ) to our data and a plant phylogeny ( Zanne et al., 2014; see Methods ), we tested whether perceived taste and flavour qualities, as well as their overall intensity and complexity predict recorded therapeutic uses whilst simultaneously accounting for the confounding effects of the shared uses and chemosensory stimuli by drugs from closely related species. 
 We used 22 descriptors to represent perceived chemosensory qualities of 700 botanical drugs and identified 46 therapeutic uses across 25 categories as described in DMM ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 1 and 4 ). A group of 11 panellists conducted 3973 sensory trials ( see Methods ) and reported 10, 463 individual perceptions of qualities. The most frequently reported qualities were bitter ( 1556 reports; 39% of all assessed samples ), herby/leafy ( 1146 reports; 29% ), aromatic ( 795 reports; 20% ), and stinging ( 730 reports; 18% ), while the least was mucilaginous ( 128 reports; 3. 2% ). Weak qualities were most frequently reported ( 5244 reports; 50% ) ; 3899 ( 37% ) of reports were of medium strength and 1320 ( 13% ) were perceived as strong. Balsamic ( 69 reports; 24% ), burning/hot ( 41 reports; 22% ), and fresh/cooling ( 49 reports; 21% ) were the qualities most often perceived as strong, while smoky ( 87 reports; 61% ), sour ( 224 reports; 60% ), and starchy ( 190 reports; 59% ) the qualities most often perceived as weak. Panellists perceived between zero ( e. g. Anemone coronaria, root ) and ten ( Cinnamomum verum, bark ) individual qualities per drug. The mean number of therapeutic uses per botanical drug was 6. 3 and the most frequently mentioned therapeutic use being ‘gynaecology – abortion and menses’ ( 272 use records ) and the least frequently mentioned ‘cardiac problems’ ( 7 use records ). The relationship between intensity of chemosensation ( the sum of all chemosensory scores across all qualities, Figure 2a; see Methods ) and therapeutic versatility is positive ( px < 0. 001; Figure 2c ). On the other hand, chemosensory complexity ( the number of chemens qualities reported per drug, Figure 2b; see Methods ) was also positively related to versatility ( px 0. 001; Figure 2 ). We found that 21 of 22 chemosens qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use ( Figure 3; see Methods ). The most predictive chemens qualities were astringent, musky, sweet, and soapy ( Figure 4; see Methods ), which were associated with a higher number of therapeutic uses ( Figure 5; see Methods ). These results suggest that chemensation plays an important role in the selection and use of botanical drugs in ancient times. Our findings are consistent with the humoral theory of medicine, which posits that disease arises from imbalance of bodily humours and that drugs affect the flow and balance of these humours ( Jones,195; King,201 ). Our results also support the idea that chemosensation underlies physiological effects mediated by chemhesis and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of drugs in ancient times. We found associations between chemens qualities and therapeutic uses, such as bitter-tasting drugs for stomach problems and astringent ones for diarrhoea, which are still recognised in Western medicine today ( Wagner et al,2007 ). These observations establish a role for chemens qualities in medicine, yet taste and flavour are largely irrelevant to modern medicine aside from the industry looking for ways to mask bad tastes ( Mella et al,2013 ). Our study suggests that ancient systems of traditional medicine could be relevant to modern science. The theory of hum was discredited but our results show that practices may have scientific basis. We propose that taste and flavour of drugs link humoral theory to modern medicine and that chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemesis and pharmacology explain the diversity of uses of drugs in ancient times. Our results provide insights into the development of pharmacological knowledge and therapeutic behaviour and suggest that tastes and flavours, as determined by modern tasting panel, predict uses recorded in ancient texts. This is an unprecedented insight into chemensation combination with physiological guided human behaviour in prehistoric times and conditioned expectations humoral in historic times. 
The results of this study suggest that chemensation plays an important role in the selection and use of botanical drugs in ancient times. The relationship between intensity of chemensation and versatility is positive and chemens complexity is also related to versatility. The most predictive chem qualities are astring, musky, sweet, and soapy which are associated with a higher number of therapeutic uses. These results are consistent with the humoral theory of medicine and support the idea that chemensation underlies physiological effects mediated by chemesis and pharmacology explain the diversity of uses of drugs in ancient times.

These establish a role for chem qualities in medicine yet taste and flavour are largely irrelevant to modern aside the industry looking for ways to mask tastes. The study suggests ancient systems could be relevant to modern and the theory of hum was discredited but results show practices may have scientific basis. The taste and flavour of drugs link humoral to modern and chemensation and physiological mediated by chemesis and pharmac explain the diversity of uses in ancient. The results provide insights into development pharmacological knowledge and behaviour and suggest tastes flavours predict uses recorded in ancient texts an unprecedented insight into chemensation with physiological guided behaviour in prehistoric and conditioned expectations historic.

    Title: 
    Article: Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections. 
 Bacteria use chemosensory systems to survey and navigate their environments ( Gumerov et al., 2021; Wadhwa and Berg, 2022; Zhou et al., 2023 ). In the exceptionally dynamic environment of the host gut, peristalsis and flow constantly perturb the microscopic physicochemical landscape. Responding to such transient and shifting stimuli is enabled by chemosensing that allows bacteria to rapidly restructure their populations, within seconds, through taxis toward or away from effector sources ( Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2015; Perkins et al., 2019 ). Many enteric pathogens and pathobionts use a form of chemosensing known as chemotaxis to colonize specific tissues, whereby bacteria swim toward or away from sources of exogenous nutrients, toxins, and host-emitted cues ( Zhou et al., 2023; Keegstra et al., 2022; Matilla and Krell, 2018 ). Previously, we determined that most bacterial genera classified by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as ‘priority pathogens’ employ chemotaxis systems for efficient infection and exert precise control over their colonization topography ( Zhou et al., 2023; Murray et al., 2022; Tacconelli et al., 2018 ). These include multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens of the gut such as Salmonella enterica, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ), Citrobacter koseri, and Enterobacter cloacae, which present major challenges for nosocomial infections and global health ( Zhou et al., 2023; Tacconelli et al., 2018 ). Mapping the chemosensing signals enteric bacteria perceive within the host can provide insight into pathogenesis and perhaps be a source of drug targets for inhibiting pathogen navigation and colonization ( Zhou et al., 2023; Matilla and Krell, 2023 ). Gut dysbiosis—a diseased host state induced by pathologies, inflammation, and infections—exposes enteric bacteria to chemical stimuli distinct from that of a healthy gut that could encourage opportunistic pathogenesis ( Zhou et al., 2023; Belizário and Faintuch, 2018 ). Yet, the stimuli sensed by bacterial pathogens and pathobionts within the dysbiotic gut environment remain poorly understood. Investigating how chemosensing controls the responses of pathogen populations to chemical features associated with dysbiosis presents an opportunity to gain deeper insights into the critical juncture between infection resolution and exacerbation ( Figure 1; Zhou et al., 2023; Belizário and Faintuch, 2018; Rogers et al., 2020; Donaldson et al., 2016 ). In a diseased gut, enteric bacteria may encounter a distinctive host-derived chemical feature not found in a healthy gut: GI bleeding. The microenvironment of an enteric hemorrhagic lesion involves a source of serum, the liquid component of blood, emanating from the host tissue and diffusing into the intestinal lumen ( Figure 1 ). In effect, this creates a microscopic gradient, that is, a microgradient, of chemicals flowing outward from a point source that may serve as chemosensory signals for bacteria. Enteric infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae species can lead to GI bleeding, a condition with a significant risk of mortality. Although severe GI bleeding is not a typical outcome of enteric infection, it is a substantial burden on human health, affecting around 40–150 out of every 100, 000 individuals annually, with a fatality rate ranging from 6% to 30% ( Figure 1; Zhou et al., 2023; Tacconelli et al., 2018; Aljarad and Mobayed, 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Moledina and Komba, 2017; Saltzman, 2022; Scales and Huffnagle, 2013 ). Enterobacteriaceae are prone to bloodstream entry and are a leading cause of sepsis-related deaths in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs ) that have recurrent enterohemorrhagic lesions ( Weber et al., 2020; Goren et al., 2020 ). Intestinal intra-abdominal abscesses, microperforations, and fistulas associated with IBD predispose patients to GI bleeding and bacteremia ( Satoh et al., 2020; Vohra et al., 2020 ). Despite the established connection between Enterobacteriaceae-induced sepsis and GI bleeding, it remained unknown whether these bacteria perceive serum through chemosensing. Serum is a complex biological solution with components that may enhance, or hinder, bacterial growth. It offers a rich reservoir of nutrients for bacteria: sugars and amino acids at millimolar concentrations and essential metals like iron and zinc ( Zhou et al., 2023; Murdoch and Skaar, 2022 ). Yet, serum also contains host factors that inhibit bacterial proliferation in the bloodstream such as cathelicidin, defensins, and the complement system ( Cheng et al., 2019; Xu and Lu, 2020 ). Consequently, how enteric pathogens and pathobionts might respond to serum diffusing into a liquid environment remained unclear. To address this open question, we elucidated how Enterobacteriaceae species use chemosensing to respond to serum, the molecular mechanism of this response, and how chemosensing is employed to enter and migrate into enterohemorrhagic lesions. Across all examined scenarios we observe these bacteria to exhibit remarkable sensitivity and attraction toward human serum. These findings suggest that environmental stimuli unique to the dysbiotic gut, sensed through bacterial chemosensory systems, can encourage pathogenic behaviors and adverse consequences for the host. 
 To model features of enteric bleeding in vitro, we utilized an experimental system to inject minute quantities of human serum into a pond of motile bacteria and observe real-time responses by microscopy ( Figure 2A ). The system and methodology, which we refer to herein as the CIRA, offer several advantages for studying bacterial chemosensing and localization in response to serum: ( 1 ) we can use bona fide human serum, ( 2 ) the readouts are direct measurements of real-time localization dynamics of the bacterial population, and ( 3 ) similar to a bleeding event, a source of fresh serum is continuously emitted. By employing multichannel fluorescence imaging of differentially labeled bacterial populations, we observe polymicrobial interactions through head-to-head comparisons of bacterial behavior within the same experiment. The CIRA microgradient is established through injection at a constant rate of ~300 fl/min, through a 0. 5 µm glass microcapillary, and expands over time through diffusion ( Figure 2A and B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). The diffusion of serum metabolites can be reasonably approximated by the three-dimensional differential diffusion equation ( Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2, ‘Method details’ ). We calculate that the introduction of a minute volume of novel effector produces a steep microgradient, in which a millimolar source recedes to nanomolar concentrations after diffusion across only a few hundred microns ( Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). For instance, in our assay we expect a bacterium 100 µm from a 1 mM infinite-volume source to experience a local concentration of a small molecule effector ( diffusion coefficient approximately 4 × 10−6 cm2 s–1 ) of 10 nM ( Figure 2B, Figure—supplement 1 ). The CIRA allows us to study chemosensing of bacteria in response to serum in a controlled environment that mimics GI bleeding. We found that all examined Enterobacteraceae species are attracted to serum and exhibit chemotaxis toward the source ( Figure 2C and 2—figure supplement 1 ). This response is mediated by the chemoreceptor Tsr, an amino acid abundant in serum ( Figure 2D and 2— supplement 1 ) that is recognized by Tsr through direct binding ( Figure 2E and 2— supplement 1 ). We determined the crystal structure of Salmonella Typhimium T in complex with L-ser and identified a conserved amino acid motif for L-ser shared among T orthologs ( Figure 2F and 2— supplement 1 ). Tsr is conserved among Enterobacteraceae and numerous WHO priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections ( Figure 2G and 2— supplement ). We find that Enterobacteraceae use serum as a source of nutrients for growth and chemaxis and chemore T provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrh lesions ( Figure 2H and 2— supplement ). We define this behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization hemorrhagic lesions, and consumption of serum as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate the proclivity of Enterobacteraceae for bloodstream infections.

    Title: 
    Article: Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species, therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies. 
 Understanding what defines the uniqueness of a given cell type out of the 843 predicted cellular fates in the human body is a complex and fascinating problem ( Han et al., 2020 ). Through Conrad Waddington’s foundational work, we have come to appreciate that developmental trajectories ultimately dictate cell type identity via the establishment of specific transcriptional programs ( Hermann et al., 2018 ). The fact that transcriptomes tend to cluster by tissue type rather than by species ( Merkin et al., 2012 ) clearly indicates that gene expression identity can be maintained across many million years of evolutionary divergence. This echoes the modular nature of eukaryotic biological processes, whose intervening macromolecular complexes are typically built by the addition of younger components to a core block of ancient subunits ( Wan et al., 2015 ). The emergence of germ cells is considered one of the first cell type specializations in metazoan history ( Arendt, 2008 ). Since the capability to undergo both sexual reproduction and gametogenesis were already present in the unicellular ancestor of all Metazoa ( Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2017 ), the split between germ line and soma presumably provided early multicellular organisms increased robustness against mutations while minimizing genetic conflict between different cell lineages ( Extavour, 2007 ). Yet, reproductive protein genes are some of the most rapidly evolving across the tree of life ( Swanson and Vacquier, 2002 ), leading to substantial variation in male reproductive tissues even between closely related species ( Ramm et al., 2014; Fitzpatrick et al., 2022 ). At the molecular level, this variation can be mainly traced back to rapid evolutionary changes in gene expression in the testis ( Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019 ) – likely facilitated by widespread transcriptional leakage in male germ cells ( Soumillon et al., 2013 ) – and to the preferential emergence of new genes in this organ ( Kaessmann, 2010 ), where they often acquire functions in spermatogenesis ( Kondo et al., 2017 ). Although the rapid divergence of genes directly involved in reproduction has traditionally been interpreted from an adaptationist stance, relaxed selection and drift have been recently proposed to account for this pattern ( Dapper and Wade, 2020 ). Central to this debate is the often-overlooked contribution of old genes for germ cell development and function. We have recently observed, in a wide range of plant species, a substantial contribution of old genes to the pollen transcriptome, suggestive of an ancient transcriptional program common to plant male gametes ( Julca et al., 2021 ). Such observation finds parallel in the concept of a metazoan germ line multipotency program ( Fierro-Constaín et al., 2017 ), and is supported by transcriptional similarities between equivalent spermatogenic cell types across mammalian species ( Lau et al., 2020; Shami et al., 2020; Murat et al., 2023 ). This led us to explore the possibility that, despite the rapid evolution of reproductive protein genes, the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old, evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility. To test this hypothesis, we devised an interdisciplinary research platform based on four combined approaches ( Figure 1a ). First, we determined, through comparison of genome sequences, the age of the gene expression program of male germ cells from three evolutionarily distant metazoan species: humans ( Homo sapiens ), mice ( Mus musculus ), and fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ). Then, we used network science to infer the significance of deeply conserved genes within the context of the complex male germ line transcriptome. Subsequently, through developmental biology ( in vivo RNAi in fruit fly testes ), we defined the role of a key subset of the conserved germ cell transcriptome in male reproductive fitness. Finally, we merged this information with clinical genetics to identify new potential causes of human infertility. Overall, we show that deeply conserved genes play a prominent role in male germ cell regulation and that the disruption of this ancient genetic program leads to human reproductive disease. 
 Male germ cell development is divided into three conserved stages ( Navarro-Costa et al., 2020 ). The first is the pre-meiotic stage and corresponds to the mitotic expansion of committed precursors ( spermatogonia ). Meiosis defines the second stage, with the newly differentiated spermatocytes undergoing reductive division. In the third stage, the post-meiotic cells ( spermatids ) embark on a cytodifferentiation program that culminates in the formation of mature male gametes. To understand to what extent male germ cell transcription quantitatively differs from that of somatic lineages, we collected previously published high-quality RNA-Seq datasets from pre-meiotic, meiotic, and post-meiotic germ cell populations, and compared them with representative somatic cell types of the primary embryonic layers: neurons ( ectoderm ), muscle ( mesoderm ), and enterocytes ( endoderm; Figure 1b and Supplementary file 1 ). We centered our analysis on three evolutionarily distant gonochoric species with excellent genome annotations – humans, mice, and fruit flies ( the last two also being well-established animal models for the functional study of human spermatogenesis ) – and observed that, as previously reported ( Soumillon et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2020 ), male germ cells have a generally more diversified transcriptome than their somatic counterparts ( as measured by the percentage of the entire genome that each cell type expresses ). Yet, this increased complexity was mainly restricted to extremely permissive minimum average expression cut-offs ranging from >0. 01 to >0. 5 transcripts per million ( TPM ), suggestive of a significant degree of transcriptional noise or other previously hypothesized translation-independent roles for lowly expressed transcripts ( Liu and Zhang, 2020 ). Indeed, the use of a more suitable threshold for protein-coding transcripts ( TPM >1; Thul et al., 2017 ) revealed that, on average, metazoan male germ cells tend to express approximately 10, 000 genes ( 9, 468±498–12, 195±1144, depending on the species ), corresponding to half of the entire protein-coding genome ( 48. 0–67. 9%; Figure 1b and Supplementary file 1 ). In both humans and mice, this range is comparable to that observed in somatic cell types such as neurons and enterocytes ( 53. 4–53. 7% and 37. 3–45. 6% of the genome, respectively ). Only in fruit flies, a species with a smaller genome ( 13, 947 protein-coding genes vs. 22, 802 and 22, 287 in humans and mice, respectively ), the diversity of the male germ cell transcriptome diverged substantially from that found in representative somatic tissues ( with an average of 67. 9 ± 3. 6% of the genome expressed in germ cells vs. 33. 3 ± 12. 5% in the soma ). It should be noted that this percentage may be higher in fruit flies due to the presence of transcripts of somatic origin in the germ cell dataset ( see Supplementary file 1 ). Collectively, these observations suggest that the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell corresponds to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes. Such a number brings a significant but largely overlooked functional constraint to the general notion that almost all protein-coding genes are transcribed in the male germ line. We next assessed the contribution of deeply conserved genes to the male germ cell transcriptome. For this we used phylostratigraphy, a technique that determines the evolutionary age of groups of homologous genes ( defined as orthogroups in our analysis, including both orthologs and paralogs ) by mapping their last common ancestor in a species tree ( Domazet-Loso et al., 2007 ). We applied this method to the transcriptomes of pre-meiotic, meiotic, and post-meiotic germ cells from humans, mice, and flies, and found that a set of 79 deeply conserved genes were expressed in all three species ( Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1 ). This set of deeply conserved genes contained 104 functional associations between gene regulators that represent a core of the conserved program of metazo spermatogenesis ( Figure 3 and Supplementary 1 ). These genes were involved in a range of biological processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin modification, cell cycle, and cytoskeleton organization, and spermatogenesis ( Figure 3 and Supplementary 1 ). Notably, many of these conserved genes have been previously implicated in human disease, including cancer and infertility ( Figure 3 and Supplementary 1 ). We hypothesized that disruption of this conserved program could lead to human disease. To test this, we used RNAi in vivo in fruit testes to define the role of a subset of conserved genes in male reproductive fitness ( Figure 4 and Supplementary 1 ). We identified 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility ( Figure 5 and Supplementary 1 ). These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establish a cross-species pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell and pathologies. 
Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

**Title:** Researchers have identified a conserved genetic program that defines the identity of male cells across animal species, despite rapid evolution of reproductive genes. They found that male cells express approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, half of which are deeply conserved and involved in spermatogenesis. Disruption of this program leads to human disease and infertility.

* Disruption of conserved program leads to human disease and infertility
* 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and 3 potential causes of human infertility identified
* Cross-species pipeline can be repur to other cell and pathologies
* Evolutionary history important for reproductive disease

**Methodology:**

* Comparison of genome sequences of male cells from humans, mice, and flies
* Network analysis of conserved genes in complex germ transcriptome

    Title: 
    Article: Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination. The model organism for studying flagellate motility, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, employs synchronous, breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim, and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating. In C. reinhardtii, the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella; however, how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive. For example, it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties ( i. e. frequency, waveform, etc. ) appear to be copied by the other one. In this study, we combine experiments, computations, and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating. With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum, we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors. 
 We set out to establish a non-invasive experimental technique that exerts differential loads on the flagella of C. reinhardtii. Following Quaranta et al., 2015, we use external background flows to exert hydrodynamic forcing on captured cells. Hydrodynamic forces are generated by a relative motion between the captured cell and its surrounding fluid. While the cell is captured by a glass pipette fixed in the laboratory frame, the fluid moves with the flow chamber - which is fixed on an oscillating piezoelectric stage. By programming the sinusoidal oscillations of the stage, we generate flows of desired amplitude U0 and frequency f0 and impose these flows along different directions θ to differentially load the two flagella, see Figure 1A. For each recording, we extract the phase dynamics of flagellar beating from videography ( Quaranta et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021 ), Figure 1B. First, recordings are masked and thresholded to highlight the flagella. Then, we extract the mean pixel values over time within two sampling windows ( Figure 1C ), and convert the two signals into observable-invariant flagellar phases ϕc, t ( Kralemann et al., 2008 ), see Figure 1D. In all our experimental recordings, the cis and the trans flagella beat synchronously. Typical phase locking between them is represented in Figure 1D inset, where the phase difference Δ=ϕc−ϕt fluctuates around 0. Therefore, ϕc and ϕt are equal and denoted as ϕ. The response of the flagella to the external hydrodynamic loads is therefore characterized by the difference between the flagellar phase ϕ ( t ) and the phase of the oscillating flow ϕ0=2πf0t. Hereafter, we refer to the synchronization of the flagellar beating with the imposed external flow as ‘flow entrainment’, in order to avoid confusion with the ‘synchronization’ between the cis and the trans flagella. In our experiments, the cis and trans flagella always beat synchronously, therefore flow entrainment always takes place for both flagella simultaneously, regardless of the flow’s direction. Differential external loads are selectively exerted on the cis- and the trans-flagellum by imposing oscillatory background flows at an angle with respect to the cell’s symmetry axis. We use numerical simulations to quantify the differential loads exerted by flows along different angles θ = 45°, 90°, and 135°, on the cis- and the trans flagellum, see Figure 1A. For each experiment, we track both flagella for the entire duration of the recording, see Figure 1B. We use the tracked motion of the flagella together with the oscillatory background flow as the boundary conditions to solve the Stokes equations numerically. Our numerical approach uses boundary element methods ( BEM ) and slender-body theory ( SBT ), from which we can directly deduce the total drag force F on each flagellum as well as the associated power P of the viscous forces on each flagellum. In the linear Stokes regime, the drag force F is the sum of the contributions due to the motion of the flagella and the motion of external flow. Our simulations allow us to compute both contributions separately. We present the loads induced by the external flow FFlow and PFlow ( see Materials and methods for details ). Our computations provide the loads on the flagella throughout the entire experiment, from the time the captured cell is gradually entrained by the external flow, see Appendix 1: Hydrodynamic computation for asymmetric loading for the entire time series. Figure 1E, F, G represent the loads on each flagellum for flows with θ = 45°, 90°, 135°, after the cell is fully entrained. The variations of the loads are presented for one period of the power-recovery stroke, and have been obtained by phase averaging over N≈30 periods. Upper panels display the magnitude of the drag force FFlow=|FFlow|; while lower panels show associated power PFlow. Each panel presents the forces and powers on the cis and the trans-flagellum in red and blue respectively. The force magnitudes are scaled by Fswim=6πμRUswim = 9. 9 pN; while the powers by Pswim=FswimUswim=1. 1 fW. Fswim is the Stokes drag on a typical free-swimming cell ( radius R=5 μm, speed Uswim=110 μm/s, water viscosity μ=0. 95 mPa·s ). Along θ = 90°, the external flow loads both flagella symmetrically ( Figure 1F ). However, for flows with θ = 45°, the loads on the cis-flagellum ( red ) are ~2 times stronger than those on the trans ( blue ) ( Figure 1E, FFlowc≈2FFlowt ), whereas flows with θ = 135° do the opposite ( Figure 1G ). The selectivity also manifests in ( the absolute values of ) PFlow. We do notice that flows along θ = 135° are able to entrain the flagella with PFlow<0, meaning that the flagella are working against the flows, and this shall be discussed in later sections. Our computations demonstrate that flows along θ = 45° impose stronger loads on the cis flagellum, and we will refer to these as cis-flows, hereon forward. Likewise, flows on θ = 135° selectively load the trans and we denote these as trans-flows. Finally, the flows along θ = 90° that approach the cell from the front will be called frontal-flows. 
 The two flagella of C. reinhardtii have long been known to have inherently different dynamic properties such as frequency, waveform, level of active noise, and responses to second messengers ( Kamiya and Hasegawa, 1987; Okita et al., 2005; Leptos et al., 2013; Wan, 2018; Saegusa and Yoshimura, 2015 ). Intriguingly, when connected by basal fibers and beating synchronously, they both adopt the kinematics of the cis- ( eyespot ) flagellum, which led to the assumption that the flagella may have differential roles in coordination. In this work, we test this hypothesis by employing oscillatory flows applied from an angle with respect to the cells’ symmetry axis and thus exert biased loads on one flagellum. In all our experiments with wt cells, we robustly observe that cis-flows, the ones that selectively load the cis flagellum, are always more effective in entraining the flagellar beating than the trans-flows. This is shown by the larger effective forcing strengths ( ε ( cis-flow ) >ε ( trans-flow ), Figure 3B ) and larger entrained time fractions ( τ ( cis-flow ) >τ ( trans-flow ), Figure 3C ). Mapping ε ( θ ) as a function of the loads, we find empirically that the flow entrainment strength scales with the hydrodynamic load on the cis, ε∝F¯Flowc ( Figure 3D ) and that trans-loads appear to matter negligibly. These observations all indicate that the cis-loads determine whether an external forcing can entrain the cell. Moreover, this point is further highlighted by an unexpected finding: when trans-flows are applied, the trans flagellum always beats against the external flow ( PFlowt<0 ) and the only stabilizing factor for flow entrainment is the cis flagellum working transiently along with the flow ( PFlowc>0 ) during the recovery stroke ( Figure 1G lower panel ). These observations definitively prove that the two flagella have differential roles in the coordination and interestingly imply that flagella are coupled to external flow only through the cis. To elucidate the mechanisms at the origin of this asymmetry, we turn to our numerical simulations. Our computations show that cis-flows impose stronger loads on the flagellum than trans-flows ( Figure 1E, F ) and that this is due to the geometry of the flagella. The cis-flagell is longer and thinner than the transellum ( Figure 2A ) and thus has a larger surface area exposed to the flow. This results in a larger viscous drag on the cisell ( FFlowc>Flow ) and larger power ( PFlow>Plow ). The geometry of the flagella also explains why cis-fl are more effective in entraining flagellar beating than trans-fl ( Figure 3 ). The cisell is longer and thinner and has a larger surface area exposed to the flow, which results in a larger viscous drag and power on the cisell. In contrast, the transell is thicker and has a smaller surface exposed to the flow, resulting in smaller viscous drag and power on the transell. The geometry of the flagella also explains why cis-fl are more effective in entraining flagellar beating than trans-fl ( Figure 3 ). The cisell is longer and thinner and has a larger surface exposed to the flow, resulting in larger viscous drag and power on the cis. In contrast, the trans is thicker and has smaller exposed to the flow, resulting smaller viscous and power on trans. The geometry of the flagella also explains why cis-fl are more effective in entraining flagellar than trans ( Figure 3. The cis is longer and thinner and has larger exposed to flow, resulting larger viscous and on cis. In contrast the trans is thicker has smaller exposed to flow resulting smaller viscous on. The geometry of the flagella explains why cis-fl are more effective entraining flagellar than trans ( Figure 3. The cis is longer and thinner has larger exposed flow resulting viscous on cis.

    Title: 
    Article: Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. 
 Obesity is defined as an epidemic metabolic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation as the consequence of long-term energy surplus. Thus, therapeutic management of obesity has been focused on the restoration of energy balance, either by decreasing energy intake or by increasing energy expenditure ( Liu et al., 2021 ). Among these strategies, intermittent fasting is becoming a popular dietary approach. All intermittent fasting schemes including alternate day fasting, 5:2 intermittent fasting, and daily time-restricted feeding have shown the health benefits such as delaying aging ( Colman et al., 2009; Mattison et al., 2012; Mattison et al., 2017; Ulgherait et al., 2021; Stekovic et al., 2019 ), improving metabolism ( de Cabo and Mattson, 2019; Hepler et al., 2022 ), and enhancing cognition ( Mattson et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Mattson and Arumugam, 2018 ). The mechanism underlying metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Its metabolic benefit was initially attributed to limitation of energy intake. Recent studies have indicated an alternative mechanism involving beigeing of white adipose tissue, which accounts for the major plasticity of energy expenditure. Studies by Kim et al., 2017, have shown that intermittent fasting induces white adipose beigeing via stimulation of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 polarization. On the other hand, studies by Li et al., 2017, have indicated that alternate day fasting induces white adipose tissue beigeing by shaping the gut microbiota and elevating the fermentation products acetate and lactate. Although gut microbiota is closely related to immune response, it remains unclear whether intestinal immune cells contribute to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. Innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs ) are a group of natural immune cells lacking antigen-specific receptors expressed on T cells and B cells ( Gasteiger et al., 2015 ). Based on developmental trajectories, ILCs are divided into five groups: natural killer cells, type 1 ILCs, type 2 ILCs, type 3 ILCs ( ILC3s ), and lymphoid tissue-inducing cells ( Vivier et al., 2018 ). Adipose-resident type 1 ILCs can promote adipose tissue fibrosis and obesity-associated insulin resistance ( O’Sullivan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019 ) while type 2 ILCs promote beiging of white adipose tissue and limit obesity ( Brestoff et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2021b ). However, the contribution of ILC3s on adipocytes and obesity are less clear. ILC3s can produce interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) in response to extracellular bacteria and fungi ( Sanos et al., 2009 ). ILC3s-derived IL-22 can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function, reduce endotoxemia and inflammation, ameliorate insulin sensitivity ( Wang et al., 2014; Hasnain et al., 2014 ), and improve the metabolic disorder of polycystic ovary syndrome ( Qi et al., 2019 ). However, ILC3s are also reported to be involved in the induction of obesity ( Sasaki et al., 2019 ), contributing to the metabolic disease ( Sasaki et al., 2019; Upadhyay et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017; Kawano et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the role of ILC3s in metabolic disease seems complex and the role of ILC3s in intermittent fasting and beigeing of adipose tissue is not known. Here, we showed that alternate day fasting promoted the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. Further, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased thermogenesis in diet-induced obesity ( DIO ) mice. Exogenous IL-22 induced the beigeing of white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. Our study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis is actively involved in the regulation of adipose tissue beigeing. Our findings thus reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue. 
 To explore the effect of intermittent fasting on intestinal immune cells, we applied alternate day fasting to mice fed normal chow diet ( NCD-IF group ) or high-fat diet ( HFD-IF group ) ( Figure 1A ). Intermittent fasting significantly reduced the body weight of mice fed HFD, while demonstrating no effect on food intake rate which was normalized to body weight ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B ). Moreover, intermittent fasting decreased the respiratory quotient ( RQ ) on the fasting day while increased the energy consumption on the feeding day in mice fed HFD ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D ), improved glucose and lipid metabolism in mice fed HFD ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F ), and promoted white adipose tissue beigeing in mice fed NCD or HFD ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). To explore whether gut immune system contributes to the effects of intermittent fasting on white adipose tissue beigeing, we examined levels of various cytokines in intestine. Notably, mRNA level of Il22 in the NCD-IF group was significantly higher relevant to the control group ( Figure 1B ). Consistently, plasma concentration of IL-22 detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was also increased ( Figure 1C ). These results suggest that intermittent fasting increases levels of IL-22 in the intestine and plasma. Since ILC3s are the main source of IL-22 in the small intestine ( Seillet et al., 2020; Victor et al., 2017; Gronke et al., 2019 ), we detected the proportion of ILC3s in the lamina propria of small intestine using flow cytometry. In mice fed NCD, intermittent fasting significantly increased proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s in the small intestine lamina propria ( siLP ) ( Figure 1D ), while demonstrating no effect on the percentile of total ILC3s ( Figure 1E ). Interestingly, intermittent fasting did not influence the secretion of IL-22 of T cells marked as lineage+ Rorγt+ cells ( Figure 1F ). Besides, intermittent fasting didn’t alter the levels of ILC3s and IL-22 in mouse adipose tissue ( Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). Similar to NCD mice, intermittent fasting significantly increased mRNA levels of IL-22 in the intestine of HFD mice while didn’t influence the secretion of IL-22 by T cells ( Figure 1H and I ). Furthermore, mice fed HFD showed an obvious reduction in the plasma IL-22 ( Figure 1J ) and percentage of total and IL-22 positive ILC3s ( Figure 1K ). Further, the decrement of plasma IL-22 ( Figure 1J ) as well as IL-22 positive ILCs in intestine ( Figure 1K ) was attenuated by 30 days’ intermittent fasting. In order to explain the chronological relationship between ILC3s secreting IL-22 and beigeing of white adipose tissue, the mice were exposed to one cycle of intermittent fasting for 2 days. At this time, the body weight of mice didn’t change and beige adipocytes haven’t been induced ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B ). However, significant increase in proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s was induced by intermittent fasting for 2 days whereas total percentile of ILC3s remained unaltered ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4C ). These results indicate that the beiging of white adipose tissue are subsequent to its effect on ILC3s secreting IL-22. Next, we examined whether adoptive transfer of ILCs could induce beige of white adipose in diet-induced obesity mice ( DIO mice ). We sorted ILCs from N-IF mice were adoptively transferred to DIO mice ( Figure 2A ). Adoptive transfer of ILCs significantly increased beige of white adipose in D mice ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, adoptive transfer of ILCs increased IL-22 in plasma ( Figure 2 ) and IL-22 positive ILCs in adipose tissue ( Figure 2 ). These results suggest that ILCs are sufficient to induce beige of adipose in diet-induced obesity. To determine whether IL-22 is sufficient to induce beige of white adipose, we treated D mice with exogenous IL-22 ( Figure 3 ). Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased beige of white adipose ( Figure 3 ) and IL-22 positive ILCs in adipose ( Figure 3 ). These results indicate that IL-22 is sufficient to induce beige of adipose. To determine whether IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) is necessary for beige of white adipose, we treated mice with anti-IL-22 ( Figure 4 ). Anti-IL-22 attenuated beige of white adipose ( Figure 4 ) and IL-22 ILCs in adipose ( Figure 4. These results indicate that IL-22R is necessary for beige of adipose. Finally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the effect of intermittent on ILCs ( Figure 5 ). Intermittent fasting increased the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in ILCs ( Figure 5 ). AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in immune response to xenobiotics and endogenous ligands. AhR has been shown to modulate the function of ILCs ( Wang et al, 2018 ). To explore the interaction between ILCs and other immune cells, we analyzed cell-cell ligand interactions ( Figure 6 ).ermittent fasting increased the interaction of ILCs with dendritic cells (DCs ) and macrophages (M ) ( Figure 6 ). DCs and M are antigen-presenting cells that present antigens to T cells. The interaction of ILCs with DCs and M modulate the function of ILCs ( Wang et al,2018 ). These results indicate that intermittent fasting modulate the interaction of ILCs with DCs and M. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of ILCs in beige of white adipose and the ILC/IL-22/IL-22 axis in the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. Our findings reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue and suggest that ILC/IL-22/IL-22 axis is involved in the regulation of adipose beige.

    Title: 
    Article: Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. 
 Defensive responses have evolved to maximize survival ( Anderson and Adolphs, 2014 ), and animals rapidly switch behaviors depending on threat imminence, the context of exposure, and previous experience with stimuli ( Perusini and Fanselow, 2015 ). Understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptive defensive behavior may grant insight into the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders, wherein heightened responses to external stimuli are observed, yet neuroscientists need more tractable methods with which to investigate how the nervous system controls complex experience-dependent behavior. Pavlovian fear conditioning has been widely used as a model system to understand the neural mechanisms underlying fear-related learning and memory ( Bolles, 1970; Bolles and Collier, 1976; Grewe et al., 2017; Roy et al., 2017; Bouton et al., 2021 ). In standard Pavlovian conditioning paradigms, freezing is the dominant defensive behavior evoked by contexts and learned cues that are paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ), like footshock ( Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969; Bolles and Collier, 1976 ). Other defensive responses like escape jumping ( Chu et al., 2024 ) and darting ( Gruene et al., 2015 ) are measured less often within conditioning, limiting insight into defensive response dynamics. To address this critical need, we developed a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors in response to conditioned stimuli ( Fadok et al., 2017; Borkar et al., 2020; Borkar and Fadok, 2021; Borkar et al., 2024 ), findings that have been replicated by others in both mice and rats ( Dong et al., 2019; Totty et al., 2021 ). In this paradigm, mice are conditioned with a SCS consisting of a pure tone followed by WN, which terminates with a strong electrical footshock. After conditioning, mice exhibit contextual freezing which significantly increases in response to tone, and mice switch to robust flight responses upon WN presentation. These findings demonstrate that the magnitude and mode of defensive behavior change with the psychological distance of threat, consistent with the predatory imminence continuum theory ( Perusini and Fanselow, 2015 ). However, the influence of non-associative elements on this ethological profile has recently been discussed ( Fanselow et al., 2019; Hersman et al., 2020; Trott et al., 2022 ). It has been suggested that the inherent salience of the WN stimulus contributes more to WN-evoked flight response than its predictive association with the US ( Hersman et al., 2020 ). Others claim that the immediate transition from freezing to flight behavior is a result of the rapid change and relative increase in stimulus intensity from tone to WN that is caused by non-associative sensitization, or by inherent stimulus properties, akin to an acoustic startle response ( Fanselow et al., 2019; Trott et al., 2022 ). In addition, sensitization and stimulus salience are known to intensify freezing responses to auditory stimuli ( Kamprath and Wotjak, 2004 ), and mice show increased reactivity to a WN stimulus after experiencing stress ( Hoffman et al., 2022 ). These findings highlight the need to better elucidate the associative and non-associative elements of Pavlovian fear conditioning that influence the expression of defensive behavior. To address this, we utilized four control groups for the non-associative effects of conditioning. To test the importance of the SCS-shock contingency, we utilized an unpaired control procedure in which the US and the SCS were presented in a separated, pseudorandom, and non-predictive fashion ( Rescorla, 1967 ). To test the effects of sensitization by the shock, we presented footshock alone during conditioning. To test the impact of stimulus intensity and salience, we conducted paired and unpaired conditioning using a reversed SCS where the WN preceded the tone. We compared these four control groups against a paired SCS-shock conditioning group to determine the effects of associative learning on SCS-evoked fear behavior. All groups went through two extinction sessions with SCS presentations alone to elucidate the extent to which prior associative pairing affects de-escalating response strategies, as well as to identify defensive behaviors that are expressed in the absence of a strict threat-signaling association. 
 Equal numbers of male and female mice were randomly assigned to either a paired ( PA ), unpaired ( UN ), shock-only ( SO ), paired reverse ( PA-R ), or unpaired reverse ( UN-R ) group for fear conditioning and fear extinction training ( Figure 1 ). Data from the PA, UN, and SO groups were statistically tested for sex differences and the significant results from these analyses are listed in Table 1. Given that most comparisons did not yield significant differences, data from male and female mice were pooled for statistical comparisons between groups. Additionally, given the minimal sex differences observed within the PA, UN, and SO groups, we reduced the number of subjects in the PA-R and UN-R groups and, therefore, did not statistically test for sex differences. Behavioral data from the PA, UN, PA-R, and UN-R groups during the second day of fear conditioning ( CD2 ) were compared to observe how conditioned defensive behavior differs based on the associative value and stimulus order of the SCS. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effect of trial and group on freezing during the tone and WN. There was no statistically significant interaction between the trial and group for tone-induced freezing ( Figure 2A; F ( 12, 340 ) =0. 65, p=0. 80 ) ; however, there was a significant main effect of the trial ( F ( 4, 340 ) =6. 3, p<0. 0001 ) and group ( F ( 3, 340 ) =19. 6, p<0. 0001 ). All groups showed little freezing to the WN ( Figure 2B ), and no significant interaction between trial and group ( F ( 12, 340 ) =0. 76, p=0. 69 ) or main effect of the trial ( F ( 4, 340 ) =2. 07, p=0. 08 ) were found. We did find a main effect of group ( F ( 3, 340 ) =3. 00, p=0. 03 ), which was attributed to greater freezing from the PA-R group during Trial 1. An activity index was calculated for each mouse as a combined measurement of cue-induced locomotion with escape jumping ( see Methods ), and a two-way ANOVA was used to analyze tone- and WN-evoked activity indices ( Figure 2C and D ). The activity indices for all groups were very low during the tone period ( Figure 2C ), and there was no significant interaction between the trial and group ( F ( 12, 340 ) =0. 98, p=0. 47 ). The activity index during the tone decreased over trials, concomitant with the observed increase in freezing behavior ( main effect of trial, F ( 4, 340 ) =3. 58, p=0. 007 ). There was a significant effect of group ( F ( 3, 340 ) =2. 7, p=0. 045 ), which was attributed to the UN-R group displaying higher activity during Trial 1. For WN-evoked activity ( Figure 2D ), there was a significant interaction between trial and group ( F (12, 340 )3., p= 0.01 ) and a main effect of trial ( F ( 4 ,340 )4.,= 0.0001 ) and group ( F ( 3 ,340 )6.,= 0.000 ). The UN-R group showed higher activity during Trial 1, while the PA and UN groups showed higher activity during Trial 2. During extinction, the PA group showed a decrease in tone-evoked freezing ( Figure 3A ) and shift from jumping to a combination of freezing and darting during WN ( Figure 3B ). The UN, SO, and UN-R groups displayed tail-rattling and darting during the S, with minimal freezing and jumping. The PA-R group did not jump to WN and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction ( Figure 3C and D ). These findings demonstrate that associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression, while non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness. 
The study aimed to investigate the role of associative and non-associative mechanisms in defensive responses using a modified Pavlov conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors. We found that associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression, while non-associ factors promote some defensive responsiveness. These findings have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders, wherein heightened responses to stimuli are observed, and highlight the need for tractable methods to investigate how the nervous system controls experience-dependent behavior.

    Title: 
    Article: To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles. 
 Insects exhibit an impressive ability to navigate the world, travelling long distances to migrate, find food or reach places of interest before returning to their nests ( Müller and Wehner, 1988; Menzel et al., 1996; Heinze et al., 2013; Collett, 2019 ), a feat that requires them to keep track of their orientation across long journeys ( Mappes and Homberg, 2004; Merlin et al., 2012; Warren et al., 2019; Collett, 2019; Beetz et al., 2022 ). This orientation tracking is achieved by the use of visual cues as well as integrating angular velocity signals over time to maintain a heading estimate relative to a starting angle ( Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015; Taube, 2007 ), known as heading integration. Electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies have shown that the neural population encoding the head direction in insects has a sinusoid-shaped activation pattern ( Labhart, 1988; Labhart, 2000; Loesel and Homberg, 2001; Pfeiffer et al., 2005; Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2007; Kinoshita et al., 2007; Heinze et al., 2009; Homberg et al., 2011; El Jundi et al., 2014; El Jundi et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, downstream neural populations also encode velocity signals as sinusoidal activations ( Lyu et al., 2022 ). Theoretical work has speculated that this recurring motif of sinusoidal activity patterns might be so prevalent because it enables easy elementwise vector addition, where vectors encoded as sinusoidal activity waveforms can be added together to give a sinusoidal waveform encoding the sum of the vectors ( Touretzky et al., 1993; Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995; Vickerstaff and Di Paolo, 2005 ). This allows the encoded heading to be easily used by downstream circuitry to track the insect’s position ( Mittelstaedt, 1985; Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995; Vickerstaff and Di Paolo, 2005; Haferlach et al., 2007; Wessnitzer et al., 2008; Sakura et al., 2008; Stone et al., 2017 ). Further studies have shown that models closely aligned with biological data can indeed implement heading integration using sinusoidal activity patterns ( Pisokas et al., 2020; Turner-Evans et al., 2020 ), and that such circuits can be learned ( Vafidis et al., 2022 ). Here, we show that enabling easy vector addition cannot be the unique driving factor for the presence of sinusoidal heading encodings, as many other circuits with different activity patterns can perform vector addition in the same way. This finding led us to question whether the sinusoidal activation patterns seen in insect navigation circuits are a coincidence, or if they might offer a particular functional advantage that was selected for during evolution. To address this question, we consider the basic principles necessary for a circuit encoding direction. Of all the circuits fulfilling these requirements, the sinusoidal activity pattern offers the best resilience to noise for the encoded information. However, obtaining this activity requires a circuit with a specific connectivity pattern between neurons. Thus, our theory predicts that the heading integration circuit will have a sinusoidal connectivity pattern. We compare our predicted circuit with connectivity data for the desert locust ( Schistocerca gregaria ) and fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) using network analysis tools, showing a strong agreement. We then ask how an insect brain might develop such a circuit, finding that a simple Hebbian learning rule is sufficient. Finally, we combine ideas from replication dynamics with our theory, which leads us to the conclusion that the eight-column structure is a consequence of basic theoretical principles, rather than an evolutionary coincidence. 
 We consider a population of N ‘compass neurons’ with an activity that encodes the direction of the insect as an angular variable θ. We represent the activity of this population by a vector where each element corresponds to the activity of one neuron, a ( θ ) =[a1 ( θ ), a2 ( θ ),..., aN ( θ ) ]. We take N=8 neurons, consistent with data from many insect species which possess an eight-column organisation, with each column encoding a different direction ( Honkanen et al., 2019; Stone et al., 2017; Pisokas et al., 2020 ). Each neuron’s activity is updated depending on its current firing rate and the inputs it receives, both from other neurons in the circuit and externally. We formulate this update rule as follows: ( 1 ) a˙ ( θ ) =−a ( θ ) +ϕ[Wa ( θ ) +u ( t ) ], where W is the circuit’s weight matrix, representing the connections between neurons; ϕ is the neural activation function, that converts the total neural input into an output firing rate; and u ( t ) is the external input that encodes the insect’s angular velocity, via the PEN population of neurons ( Green et al., 2017; Turner-Evans et al., 2017; Sayre et al., 2021; Pisokas et al., 2020; Turner-Evans et al., 2020; Hulse et al., 2021 ). To simplify our derivations we allow the neural activity values to be both positive and negative, interpreting these values as being relative to a baseline neural firing rate. Similarly, we allow the weights to be both positive and negative, a common simplification in computational models ( Li et al., 2023; Cornford et al., 2020; Kriegeskorte and Golan, 2019 ). This simplification will be addressed in section ‘Comparing the predicted circuit with biological data’ where we compare our model with experimental data. As we consider networks with N=8 neurons, consistent with multiple insect species ( Honkanen et al., 2019; Stone et al., 2017; Pisokas et al., 2020 ), the possible single harmonic circuits are f={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, where the zeroth harmonic is discarded because it only represents the baseline neural activity. This gives the following activities and weights, derived from Equation 5 and Equation 14 ( 16 ) an ( θ ) =cos⁡ ( 2πnfN+θ ) ωn=cos⁡ ( 2πfnN ). The circuits for the first four harmonics are plotted in Figure 3, but not all of these circuits are valid. In particular, circuits with even spatial frequencies have multiple neurons with identical activity values because they share a common divisor with N=8, as explained in detail in section ‘Degenerate circuits’. For f=4 there are only two unique activity values, an=±cos⁡ ( θ ) ∀n, so this circuit can only encode one dimension, not a circular topology ( see Figure 3D ). For f=2 and f=6 ( not plotted ), there are four unique activity values, allowing the angle to be properly encoded. However, these circuits are degenerate because they are composed of two independent subcircuits, each encoding one direction ( see Figure 3B ). Because the weights connecting the two subcircuits are all zero, the activity in each subcircuit is independent of the activity in the other, and so the overall activity cannot be constrained to have the required circular topology. All circuits with odd harmonic frequencies are equivalent. For example, as shown in Figure 3, the connections in the circuit for f=3 are the same as those for the f=1 circuit after the neuron identities are permuted. As detailed in section ‘Equivalence under permutation’, the frequencies f={1, 3, 5, 7} always give the same circuit because the odd frequencies are coprime with N=8. Thus, only the f=2 and f=6 circuits are nondegenerate and can encode the circular topology. We now show that the f= and f6 circuits are the most resilient to noise in the information encoded direction. To do this, we calculate the variance of the activity for each circuit as a function of noise in the weights and inputs. We find that the f and f circuits have the smallest variance, indicating they are the most robust to noise. However, this is only true when the weights are sinusoidal as well. If the weights are not sinusoidal, the f and f circuits are not the most resilient. Thus, our theory predicts that the weights should be sinusoidal. We compare our predicted weights with data from the desert locust and fruit fly, finding a strong agreement. Finally, we show that our circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the connectivity does not need to be encoded in the genetic program of the insect but can develop during development. We illustrate that the eight-column organisation of head circuits across multiple species is not a coincidence but can be explained by basic principles.

    Title: 
    Article: Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target. 
 Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by rigor, tremor, and bradykinesia. These motor symptoms stem from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain’s substantia nigra pars compacta ( reviewed in Pickrell and Youle, 2015 ). While most cases are sporadic, familial forms of PD are linked to mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control like PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and Parkin ( PRKN ), providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PD ( Shulman et al., 2011 ). In healthy cells, PINK1 is continuously imported into mitochondria, where it is rapidly degraded ( Narendra et al., 2008 ). However, in unfit mitochondria with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential ( Δψm ), PINK1 import stalls. When PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria, it phosphorylates various proteins, including the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN. This phosphorylation activates PRKN, enabling it to attach ubiquitin to mitochondrial proteins. This ubiquitination acts as a signal for damaged mitochondria to be identified and engulfed by autophagosomes, initiating their degradation through mitophagy. This selective elimination of compromised mitochondria safeguards overall mitochondrial health and function ( reviewed in Youle and Narendra, 2011 ). Much of this mechanistic understanding has been elucidated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where Pink1 and Prkn loss of function results in profound changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure causing mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired flight and climbing ability, and a shortened lifespan ( Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006 ). In addition to disturbances in mitochondrial quality control, disruptions in iron metabolism contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of PD ( Ma et al., 2021 ). PD patients exhibit elevated iron levels within the substantia nigra pars compacta, and this iron accumulation correlates with the severity of the disease ( Dexter et al., 1987; Hirsch et al., 1991 ). Notably, this iron dysregulation is apparent even in asymptomatic carriers of PRKN mutations ( Pyatigorskaya et al., 2015 ), suggesting that it is an early event and correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, human dopaminergic neurons lacking PINK1 display inhibition of the iron-dependent mitochondrial aconitase, leading to accumulation of NAD+ and depletion of essential metabolites ( Bus et al., 2020 ). In flies, Pink1 deficiency similarly results in inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase by impairing its labile iron-sulfur cluster, leading to oxidative distress and mitochondrial swelling ( Esposito et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2020 ). These findings highlight the relevance of iron dysregulation in the PD development and progression. An important target protein of PINK1/PRKN crucial for iron homeostasis and redox homeostasis is CISD1, also known as mitoNEET ( reviewed in Mittler et al., 2019 ). CISD1 is a homodimeric protein N-terminally inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol ( Wiley et al., 2007a ). CISD1 is ubiquitinated by PRKN ( Sarraf et al., 2013 ) and its levels are reduced upon dissipation of Δψm ( Chan et al., 2011; Cunningham et al., 2015; Lazarou et al., 2013; McWilliams et al., 2018; Narendra et al., 2012; Okatsu et al., 2012 ). Moreover, CISD1 forms a complex with PRKN, and this interaction is markedly increased by activation of PINK1 and ubiquitination ( Narendra et al., 2013; Sarraf et al., 2013 ). In Drosophila, the homolog of CISD1 is the most strongly ubiquitinated protein in response to Prkn overexpression in vivo ( Martinez et al., 2017 ). Functionally, CISD1 exists as a homodimer, and each monomer of CISD1 harbors an 2Fe/2S ( 2 iron/2 sulfur ) cluster coordinated by three cysteines ( Cys72, 74, 83 ) and one histidine ( His87 ). In contrast, most conventional 2Fe/2S clusters are coordinated by four cysteines or two cysteines and two histidines ( Wiley et al., 2007b ). This peculiarity renders the CISD1 2Fe/2S cluster more susceptible to oxidation. It was thus proposed that the transfer of the iron-sulfur cluster from CISD1 to stress-sensitive Fe/S proteins constitutes a cellular adaptive response that helps recovery from oxidative injury ( reviewed in Mittler et al., 2019 ). In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that the oxidized 2Fe/2S cluster of CISD1 can be transferred to iron regulatory protein 1 ( IRP1 ) ( Ferecatu et al., 2014 ), a bifunctional protein that can switch between two distinct enzymatic activities based on the availability of iron. When iron levels are sufficient, IRP1 binds an 2Fe/2S cluster, converting it into a functional aconitase enzyme. When iron levels are low, IRP1 loses its 2Fe/2S cluster and undergoes a conformational change. In this state, known as the ‘apo’ form, IRP1 functions as an RNA-binding protein and binds to specific RNA sequences called iron-responsive elements ( IREs ) located in the untranslated regions of target mRNAs ( reviewed by Rouault and Maio, 2017 ). CISD1 is capable of recycling the cytosolic apo-IRP1 to holo-aconitase by donating its 2Fe/2S cluster ( Camponeschi et al., 2017 ). The fate of the remaining apo-CISD1 is unknown. In addition to its role in iron metabolism and defense against oxidative distress, CISD1 is also involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics and in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Cardiac myocytes from Cisd1 knockout ( KO ) mice exhibit a reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity ( Wiley et al., 2007a ), akin to KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) where this dysfunction is attributed to a reduction in the total cellular mitochondrial volume ( Vernay et al., 2017 ). In Drosophila, there is a single ortholog of CISD1 initially named Cisd2 because it is slightly more similar to the mammalian CISD2 than to CISD1 ( Jones et al., 2014 ) protein. Human CISD2 is located at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Overexpression of Cisd2 ( this publication used the alternative name Dosmit ) in fly muscles is detrimental and results in mitochondrial enlargement and the formation of double-membraned vesicles containing cytosolic proteins within mitochondria ( Chen et al., 2020 ), implicating Cisd2 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Similar to human CISD1, fly Cisd2 is an Fe/S protein and all amino acids linked to cluster coordination are conserved. In addition, fly Cisd2 ( this publication used the alternative name MitoNEET ) interacts with IRP1 ( Huynh et al., 2019 ) further linking Cisd2 to iron homeostasis. Together these findings suggest that fly Cisd2 rather resembles the human mitochondrial homolog CISD1 and to avoid confusion, we will henceforth use Cisd for the fly ortholog. Based on the involvement of CIS1 and C2 in iron metabolism, bioenergetics, and regulation of mitochondrial morphology, we hypothesized that CIS1 might be involved in the pathophysiology of PD. To test this hypothesis, we generated flies overexpressing CIS1 and a mutant CIS1 incapable of binding the 2/2 cluster ( CIS1mut ). Overexpression of CIS1 resulted in reduced climbing ability and shortened lifespan in flies. This was more pronounced in Pink1 mutant flies. In contrast, loss of CIS1 rescued the detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. These results suggest that CIS1 is involved in the pathophysiology of PD and may be a potential therapeutic target.

    Title: 
    Article: Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions. 
 Parasites often excel in altering the development and behavior of their hosts, a trait essential for their survival and propagation. The trait is particularly pronounced in obligate parasites, which have substantial control over their hosts, earning them the nickname 'puppet masters'. The phenomenon exemplifies the concept of extended phenotypes ( originally coined by Dawkins, 1982 ), where the impact of an organism’s genes extends beyond its own physical form and affects other organisms. This concept is especially evident in obligate parasites that depend on alternate hosts for transmission, as they often do not only alter the conditions of their immediate hosts but also have far-reaching effects on other organisms in the ecosystem. For instance, the protozoan parasite Taxoplasma gondii changes the behavior of their intermediate rodent hosts by reducing their innate fear for cats, which are the definite hosts where the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction to produce oocysts ( Tong et al., 2021 ). Similarly, the rust fungus Puccinia monoica induces its host plant, Boechera stricta, to produce 'pseudoflowers'. These structures mimic real flowers and attract pollinators with their scent and sugary rewards, an essential strategy for the fungus to spread its spores between plants ( Roy, 1993; Cano et al., 2013 ). Although advancements have been made in identifying parasite virulence factors, our understanding of the specific host processes that are commandeered to produce these extended phenotypes is still developing. Parallel to these discoveries are the studies on the extended phenotypes of phytoplasmas, which have revealed that their manipulative abilities stem from particular genes within these pathogens ( Sugio et al., 2011b; Tomkins et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2024 ). Phytoplasmas cause disease in crops, ornamentals and native plants worldwide ( Kumari et al., 2019 ) and are often dependent on sap-feeding insects, including leafhoppers, plant hoppers and psyllids, for transmission ( Weintraub and Beanland, 2006 ). As obligate bacterial parasites, phytoplasmas frequently trigger the emergence of unusual plant structures such as leaf-like floral parts ( phyllody ) and the excessive growth and clustering of leaves and branches ( witch’s broom; Lee et al., 2000; Al-Subhi et al., 2018; Kumari et al., 2019 ). These alterations not only compromise plant health but also promote attraction and colonization of insect vectors that are primarily responsible for phytoplasma spread and transmission ( Sugio et al., 2011a; Frost et al., 2013; MacLean et al., 2014; Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016; Clements et al., 2021; Al-Subhi et al., 2021; Huang and Hogenhout, 2022 ). The responsible phytoplasma genes encode for effector molecules that, once inside the plant cell cytoplasm, target and typically disrupt or degrade essential plant transcription factors involved in growth, development, and defence ( review by Wang et al., 2024 and references therein as well as Liu et al., 2023; Suzuki et al., 2024; Correa Marrero et al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024 ). This molecular interference exemplifies the extended phenotype reach, affecting not just the host appearance but also its physiological and biological processes. The interaction between the Aster Yellows strain Witches Broom ( AY-WB ) phytoplasma and its vector, the aster leafhopper Macrosteles quadrilineatus, offers insights into the complex interplay between parasites and hosts. The effector protein secreted AY-WB protein ( SAP ) 11 binds to and destabilizes class II TCP transcription factors - this action leads to changes in leaf shapes and stem proliferation, reminiscent of witches’ brooms, and altered root architecture resembling the hairy roots found in infected plants ( Bai et al., 2009; Sugio et al., 2011a; Sugio et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2018; Pecher et al., 2019 ). Additionally, this effector reduces plant jasmonic acid and salicylic-acid-mediated defence responses, alters volatile organic compounds, and promotes the reproduction rates of the insect vectors ( Sugio et al., 2011a; Lu et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2016 ). Another effector, SAP05, recruits the 26 S proteasome component RPN10, instigating the breakdown of SPL and GATA transcription factors ( Huang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024 ). This process is linked to the typical leaf and stem proliferations of witches’ brooms in phytoplasma-infected plants. The SAP05-mediated degradation of SPLs, but not GATAs, increases the attractiveness of these plants to insect vectors ( Huang et al., 2021 ). However, the relationship between phytoplasma SAP54/PHYL1 effectors inducing leaf-like flowers and attracting insects seems more intricate. These effectors target and disrupt MADS-box transcription factors, akin to animal HOX genes, leading to a transformation of flowers into leaf-like structures, alterations that mirror the phyllody and virescence symptoms of phytoplasma infection ( MacLean et al., 2011; MacLean et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2024; Suzuki et al., 2024; Correa Marrero et al., 2024 ). SAP54 recruits plant 26 S proteasome shuttle factors called radiation sensitive 23 ( RAD23 ) to break down these transcription factors ( MacLean et al., 2014; Kitazawa et al., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2024 ). Leafhoppers prefer plants that stably produce SAP54 for reproduction and this preference phenotype requires the presence of RAD23, which is essential for both breaking down MADS-box transcription factors and inducing leaf-like flowers ( MacLean et al., 2014 ). However, the increased reproduction of insect vectors does not depend on the presence of leaf-like flowers. Our past research showed that insects prefer SAP54 plants during the vegetative developmental phase, before flowers emerge, and even flowering SAP54 plants upon removal of the leaf-like flowers ( Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016 ). Therefore, it remains unclear whether plant MADS-box transcription factors play a role in the leafhopper attraction phenotype. MADS-box transcription factors have been predominantly studied in relation to regulation of floral transition and flower organ development. Nonetheless, factors like suppressor of overexpression of CO 1 ( SOC1 ) and short vegetative phase ( SVP ) are also expressed in leaves and other organs during the A. thaliana vegetative developmental phase, and regulate processes other than orchestrating the flowering process, such as plant defence responses, as has been shown for SOC1 ( Li et al., 2020 ). Based on these insights, we hypothesize that leafhopper attraction is influenced by the presence of SVP in SAP54-exposed plants. Our results show that SVP is a key element in leafhopper preference for plants exposed to SAP54, and that SAP promotes degradation of SVP. We also demonstrate that SVP null mutant plants exposed to SAP54 are colonized more by leafhoppers than those not exposed to SAP54. This indicates that SVP plays a critical role in leafh attraction to SAP54-exposed plants. Our study highlights the dual role of phytopma effector SAP54 in host alteration and vector attraction integral to the phytopma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafh males, thus facilitating attraction and subsequent colonization by insects. SAP acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’ helping leafh locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study provides insights into the reach of single parasite genes extended phenotypes and opens avenues for understanding transcription factors that regulate developmental processes intersect and plant-insect interactions.

    Title: 
    Article: Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival. 
 Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens ( Benedict et al., 2019; Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015; Pappas et al., 2018 ). Systemic C. albicans infections are the second most common cause of mortality from infectious diseases in extremely premature infants ( 15–20% mortality ), and the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections ( 30–50% mortality ) ( Benjamin et al., 2010; Brown and Netea, 2012; Pfaller et al., 2019 ). The frequency of drug resistance is far lower than the frequency of treatment failures, such that most infections that fail to respond to antifungal drug treatments are susceptible to the drug. This clinical persistence can result from heterogeneity in antifungal drug responses, variations in host immune status, and the inability of drugs to reach their fungal target sites ( Delarze and Sanglard, 2015; Wuyts et al., 2018 ). A resistant fungal isolate can thrive in the presence of an antifungal drug at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of that species, with detectable growth within 24 hr of drug exposure. For a tolerant fungal isolate, a proportion of cells ( typically 5–95% of the population ) can grow, albeit slowly, at concentrations surpassing the population average MIC ( Berman and Krysan, 2020 ) ; tolerance is detectable only 48 hr after drug exposure, which is longer than most clinical assays are performed ( Espinel-Ingroff et al., 2017 ). Approaches for predicting patient response to an infection, based solely on the average response of cells to a drug challenge across a population after 24 hr, can overlook such subpopulations with behaviors that have the potential to significantly impact the evolution of drug resistance ( Altschuler and Wu, 2010 ). Resistance usually results from mutations that directly influence interaction of the drug with its target ( Berman and Krysan, 2020 ), while tolerance is thought to stem from phenotypic heterogeneity or cell-to-cell variations in phenotypic responses within an isogenic cell population. Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity can arise from mechanisms including stochastic or periodic gene expression, protein stability, cell age, cell-cell interactions, chromatin modifications, and genomic neoplasticity ( Ackermann, 2015 ). Heterogeneity in microbial populations can confer benefits like bet-hedging, rapid metabolic shifts, division of labor, and resource sharing ( Ackermann, 2015 ). It is important to note the distinction between antibacterial and antifungal drug tolerance. For bacteria, tolerance is defined by the duration of cell survival following periodic exposure to a bactericidal drug ( Brauner et al., 2016 ). By contrast, for fungi, tolerance is characterized by the proportion of growth in supra-MIC drug concentrations relative to growth without the drug and is best characterized in C. albicans treated with fluconazole ( FCZ ). The underlying mechanisms and implications of antifungal drug tolerance differ from those of bacterial heteroresistance, in which a small subpopulation exhibits growth in bacteriocidal drugs ( Andersson et al., 2019 ). In this study, the focus is on antifungal tolerance to FCZ, a well-known fungistatic drug. Previous studies have characterized key aspects of drug tolerance in C. albicans. Tolerance is largely drug concentration-independent and high tolerance correlates with poor clinical outcomes ( Astvad et al., 2018; Levinson et al., 2021; Rosenberg et al., 2018 ). Tolerance increases the effective population size ( Cowen and Lindquist, 2005; Vincent et al., 2016 ). The emergence of higher tolerance cannot be attributed solely to the accumulation of adaptive point mutations ( Wertheimer et al., 2016 ), as selected tolerant cells and their original parent give rise to mixed populations of tolerant and non-tolerant cells in similar proportions ( Rosenberg et al., 2018 ). Adjuvant drugs used alongside the common fungistatic FCZ not only inhibit tolerance but prevent the evolution of resistance because these drug combinations are fungicidal. Such adjuvant drugs can modulate the tolerance response by targeting Hsp90, calcineurin, TOR, PKC, and sphingolipid biosynthesis ( Cowen and Lindquist, 2005; Karababa et al., 2006; Rosenberg et al., 2018; Sanglard et al., 2003; Vincent et al., 2016 ). The molecular mechanisms coordinating tolerance regulation across cellular pathways are not yet fully understood, although stress responses appear to be central ( Cowen and Lindquist, 2005; Rosenberg et al., 2018 ). Several cellular processes are essential for tolerance, including ergosterol biosynthesis and proteasome function ( reviewed in Berman and Krysan, 2020 ). Most previous studies of drug tolerance, ranging from classic growth assays to omics profiling, have treated surviving fungal subpopulations as a homogenous whole, mainly due to a lack of technology to efficiently study large numbers of individual fungal cells. While single-cell ( sc ) transcriptomic assays have been applied extensively to mammalian systems, their use in fungal contexts remains limited due to the challenges of disrupting the rigid cell wall, lysing the membrane, and the small overall amount of RNA per cell. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several limited microfluidic or barcoding sc studies examined approximately a hundred cells ( Gasch et al., 2017; Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019b; Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019a; Urbonaite et al., 2021 ), and two high-throughput fungal transcriptome studies profiled ~40K cells ( Jackson et al., 2020; Jariani et al., 2020 ). In our preliminary pre-printed study ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ), we profiled C. albicans using a fungal nanoliter droplet-based assay ( DROP-seq ), modified from the original system presented by Macosko et al., 2015. This approach overcomes technical challenges that arise in fungal settings, providing a flexible, cost-effective solution. Here, we extend the data and analysis from Bettauer et al. to better understand subpopulation-specific responses to drug stress. Since the original sc study ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ), a second C. albicans sc study was performed to investigate the initial response ( within 3 hr ) to high FCZ concentrations ( Dohn et al., 2022 ). Dohn and colleagues observed increased expression of ergosterol genes, an increase in cell cycle arrest genes, and a transient increase in stress response gene expression at 1. 5 hr. The work also identifies interesting variability in the temporal response to acute drug exposure but does not address molecular heterogeneity in the subsequent emergence from cell cycle arrest that can only be observed as tolerance after longer times ( days 2–3 ), the focus of this study. Here, we use the fungal DROP-seq system ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ) to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in the C. albicans response to antifungal drugs. We profiled the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells from C. albicans populations that were either untreated ( UT ) or exposed to antifungal compounds with a focus on FCZ across several days. This data is integrated with bulk DNA sequencing and fluorescence microscopy to provide in-depth analyses that focus on subpopulation composition and phenotypic heterogeneity across isogenic cell populations. We detect a heterogeneous response to FCZ within isogenic populations, supporting the idea that different cells exhibit distinct survival strategies, including some with increased expression of genes related to drug tolerance. This study underscores molecular events that may lead to drug tolerance and that hold potential for future antifungal therapies.

    Title: 
    Article: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder. 
 Species differ from each other in many ways, including mating system, ploidy, spatial distribution, life history, size, lifespan, genome size, mutation rate, selective pressure, and population size. These differences make the process of purifying selection more efficient in some species than others. Our understanding of both the causes and consequences of these differences is limited in part by a reliable metric with which to measure them. In the long term, the probability that a gene is fixed for one allele rather than another allele is given by the ratio of fixation and counter-fixation probabilities ( Bulmer, 1991 ). In an idealized population of constant population size and no selection at linked sites, a mutation–selection–drift model describes how this ratio of fixation probabilities depends on the census population size N ( Kimura, 1962 ), and hence gives the fraction of sites expected to be found in preferred vs. non-preferred states ( Figure 1 ). This reasoning has been extended to real populations by positing that species have an ‘effective’ population size, Ne ( Ohta, 1973 ). Ne is the census population size of an idealized population that reproduces a property of interest in the focal population. Ne is therefore not a single quantity per population, but instead depends on which property is of interest. The amount of neutral polymorphism is the usual property used to empirically estimate Ne ( Charlesworth, 2009; Doyle et al., 2015; Lynch et al., 2016 ). However, the property of most relevance to nearly neutral theory is instead the inflection point s at which non-preferred alleles become common enough to matter ( Figure 1 ), and hence the degree to which highly exquisite adaptation can be maintained in the face of ongoing mutation and genetic drift ( Kimura, 1962; Ohta, 1972; Ohta, 1992 ). While genetic diversity has been found to reflect some aspects of life history strategy ( Romiguier et al., 2014 ), there remain concerns about whether neutral genetic diversity and the limits to weak selection always remain closely coupled in non-equilibrium settings. As a practical matter, Ne is usually calculated by dividing some measure of the amount of putatively neutral ( often synonymous ) polymorphism segregating in a population by that species’ mutation rate ( Charlesworth, 2009 ). As a result, Ne values are only available for species that have both polymorphism data and accurate mutation rate estimates, limiting their use. Worse, Ne is not a robust statistic. In the absence of a clear species definition, polymorphism is sometimes calculated across too broad a range of genomes, substantially inflating Ne ( Daubin and Moran, 2004 ) ; a poor sampling scheme can have the converse effect of deflating genetic diversity. Transient hypermutation ( Plotkin et al., 2006 ), which is common in microbes, causes further short-term inconsistencies in polymorphism levels. Perhaps most importantly, a recent bottleneck will deflate Ne based on the coalescence time, even if too brief to lead to significant erosion of fine-tuned adaptations. But drift barrier theory concerns the level with which adaptation is fine-tuned, and so a better metric would capture that directly, rather than indirectly rely on neutral diversity. An alternative approach to measure the efficiency of selection exploits codon usage bias, which is influenced by weak selection for factors such as translational speed and accuracy ( Hershberg and Petrov, 2008; Plotkin and Kudla, 2011; Hunt et al., 2014 ). The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage that is driven by selective preference offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species ( Li, 1987; Bulmer, 1991; Akashi, 1996; Subramanian, 2008 ). Conveniently, it can be estimated from only a single genome, that is, without polymorphism or mutation rate data for that species. One commonly used metric, the Codon Adaptation Index ( CAI ) ( Sharp and Li, 1987; Sharp et al., 2010 ) takes the average of Relative Synonymous Codon Usage ( RSCU ) scores, which quantify how often a codon is used, relative to the codon that is most frequently used to encode that amino acid in that species. While this works well for comparing genes within the same species, it unfortunately means that the species-wide strength of codon bias appears in the normalizing denominator ( see Equation 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Paradoxically, this can make more exquisitely adapted species have lower rather than higher species-averaged CAI scores ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B; Rocha, 2004; Botzman and Margalit, 2011 ). To compare species using CAI, it has been suggested that instead of taking a genome-wide average, one should consider a set of highly expressed reference genes ( Sharp et al., 2005; Vicario et al., 2007; Subramanian, 2008; dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009 ). This approach assumes that the relative strength of selection on those reference genes ( often a function of gene expression ) remains approximately constant across the set of species considered ( red distributions in Figure 2 ). Its use also requires careful attention to the length of reference genes ( Urrutia and Hurst, 2001; Doherty and McInerney, 2013 ), and some approaches also require information about tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances ( dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009 ). Since codon bias varies quantitatively within only a small range of sN ( Figure 1 ), a promising approach is to measure the proportion of sites at which codon adaptation is effective. We posit that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias ( Figure 2; Galtier et al., 2018 ). Indeed, CAI might also rely in part on variation in the fraction of sites within the reference genes that is subject to effective selection as a function of species ( Figure 2, red ). Here we take this logic further, considering all sites in a proteome-wide approach. Averaging across the entire proteome provides robustness to shifts in the expression level of or strength of selection on particular genes. The proteome-wide average depends on the fraction of sites whose selection coefficients exceed the ‘drift barrier’ for that particular species ( Figure 2, blue threshold ). In estimating the effects of selection, it is critical to control for other causes of codon bias. In particular, species differ in their mutational bias with respect to the proportion of the genome that consists of guanine-cytosine base pairs ( GC ), and in the frequency of GC-biased gene conversion ( Urrutia and Hurst, 2001; Duret and Galtier, 2009; Doherty and McInerney, 2013; Figuet et al., 2014 ). Here, we control for %GC, capturing species differences both in mutation and in gene conversion, by calculating the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the observed codon frequencies away from the codon frequencies that we would expect to see given the genomic %GC content of the species. Kullback–Leibler divergence measures the distance of an observed probability distribution from an expected reference distribution, capturing a measure of surprise ( Kullback and Leibler, 1951 ). This method does not require us to specify preferred vs. non-preferred codons, and can thus also accommodate situations in which different genes have different codon preferences ( Gingold et al., 2014; Cope et al., 2018 ). An alternative metric, the Effective Number of Codons ( ENC ) originally quantified how far the codon usage of a sequence departs from equal usage of synonymous codons ( Wright, 1990 ), with lower ENC values indicating greater departure. This approach creates a complex relationship with GC content ( Fuglsang, 2008 ), and so ENC was later modified to correct for GC content ( Novembre, 2002 ). However, a remaining issue with this modified ENC is that differences among species in amino acid composition might act as a confounding factor. We propose a new metric, the Cod Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), based on Kull–Leib divergence, that corrects for both GC and amino acid composition. CAIS is the average Kull–Leib divergence of the observed codon frequencies from the expected frequencies given the species’ GC content and amino acid composition. CAIS is a measure of the degree to which codon usage is adapted to the species’ environment, and can be estimated from a single genome, without polymorphism or mutation rate data. We demonstrate the use of CAIS, as well as ENC, to show that proteomes of highly adapted vertebrate species have higher intrinsic disorder than those of less adapted species.

    Title: 
    Article: Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. 
 Worldwide, 11 million sepsis-related deaths were reported in 2017, which accounted for an estimated 19. 7% of all global deaths ( Rudd et al., 2020 ). Given its high incidence and immense socio-economic burden, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has declared sepsis as a global health priority ( Reinhart et al., 2017 ). Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an imbalanced host immune response to infection. Antibiotic treatment remains the main approach to treat sepsis; however, despite the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, lethality remains high. Immune-modulating strategies are an additional approach to antibiotics to curb excessive inflammation and to support an effective defense against the infectious agents. Until recently however, most trials inhibiting cytokine responses or Toll-like receptors failed, indicating that alternative approaches for immunomodulation are required ( Cao et al., 2023 ). It has been shown that adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), as soon as it is released into the extracellular space, critically modulates inflammatory and immune responses ( Di Virgilio et al., 2020; Eltzschig et al., 2012 ) by activating ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors ( Burnstock, 2020; Junger, 2011 ). Also, such purinergic signaling critically alters immune responses during sepsis ( Dosch et al., 2019; Ledderose et al., 2016; Spari and Beldi, 2020 ). In particular, we have described that the connexin-dependent release of ATP by macrophages initiates an autocrine loop of over-activation, resulting in altered local and systemic cytokine secretion, which exacerbates abdominal sepsis ( Dosch et al., 2019 ). Such sepsis-promoting effects of host-derived extracellular ATP are secondary to inflammation initiated by bacterial pathogens. Recently, it has been discovered that also bacteria release ATP into the extracellular space ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). Such ATP release might be a conserved mechanism of protection from host defense and precede host responses. ATP release has been shown for a variety of bacteria including the sepsis-associated Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) from the Proteobacteria phylum or Enterococcus faecalis ( E. faecalis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) from the Firmicutes phylum ( Diekema et al., 2019; Hironaka et al., 2013; Iwase et al., 2010; Mempin et al., 2013; Mureșan et al., 2018 ). The mechanisms by which inflammatory and immune responses in the host are modulated by such released bacterial ATP have just begun to be elucidated ( Spari and Beldi, 2020 ). In colonized compartments such as the intestine, it has been shown that ATP released by mutualistic bacteria modulates local cellular and secretory immune responses ( Atarashi et al., 2008; Perruzza et al., 2017; Proietti et al., 2019 ) and in the mouth, bacterial ATP release leads to biofilm dispersal and periodontitis ( Ding et al., 2016a; Ding and Tan, 2016b ). However, the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or the blood in the context of local and systemic infections, remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated if ATP released from bacteria influences the outcome of abdominal sepsis. We first isolated sepsis-associated bacteria and measured the amount of ATP they release. Second, we analyzed the function of the inner bacterial membrane on ATP release over time in E. coli and in E. coli with mutations in integral respiratory chain proteins ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). Third, the function of the outer bacterial membrane on ATP release during growth was assessed using porin mutants ( Alvarez et al., 2017; Choi and Lee, 2019 ). Fourth, we investigated local effects of ATP in the abdominal cavity. Lastly, based on the finding that bacteria secrete outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) ( Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015 ), we investigated systemic consequences of released bacterial ATP. 
 To assess ATP release of sepsis-associated bacteria, abdominal fluid of patients with abdominal sepsis was sampled and an/aerobically incubated on LB agar plates ( Figure 1A ). Twenty-five different colonies were randomly picked and analyzed by whole 16S-rRNA Sanger sequencing, which resulted in 12 different bacterial species ( Figure 1B ). From these, the four most clinically important sepsis-associated bacteria E. coli, K. pneumoniae ( both gramneg ), E. faecalis, and S. aureus ( both grampos ) ( Diekema et al., 2019; Mureșan et al., 2018 ) were further cultivated for experimental studies. We quantified released ATP over time ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) using a luciferin-luciferase-based assay. A growth-dependent release of ATP was observed in all species, peaking during exponential growth phase ( Figure 1C ). Cumulative amount of released ATP was quantified using the area under the curve ( AUC ) of released ATP over time ( AUC ATP ). ATP release was detected across all assessed species ( Figure 1D ). To model these findings in mice, abdominal sepsis was induced using a standardized cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ) model ( Dosch et al., 2019; Figure 1E ). Similar to human samples, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla were predominating ( Figure 1F, see Figure 1B ). In the mouse model, E. coli released notably more cumulative ATP compared to E. faecalis and S. aureus ( Figure 1G and H ). The bacterial species assessed in humans and mice ( E. coli, E. faecalis, S. aureus ) differed on the strain level ( sequences deposited, see Data availability statement ) confirming that ATP release is strain-specific ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). In summary, sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner. E. coli, which is one of the most frequent facultative pathogens in patients with abdominal sepsis, released the highest amount of ATP isolated from a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis. After having demonstrated that sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP, we next questioned whether and how ATP release is dependent on ATP generation. ATP synthase and cytochrome oxidases, which are located in the inner bacterial membrane, are key components of ATP generation under aerobic conditions. Therefore, ATP release of the E. coli parental strain ( PS ) was compared to all available mutants of ATP synthase subunits ( ΔatpA, ΔatpB, ΔatpC, ΔatpD, ΔatpE, ΔatpF, ΔatpH ) and cytochrome bo3 oxidase subunits ( ΔcyoA, ΔcyoB, ΔcyoC, ΔcyoD ) from the Keio collection ( Baba et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 2009 ). The use of different mutants allows to identify the most relevant subunits influencing ATP release. Also, it allows to identify a possible correlation of bacterial ATP release with growth, which is a function of ATP generation ( Figure 2A; Galber et al., 2021; Ihssen et al., 2021; Memp et al, 2013 ). Mutants Δp and Δp showed significantly reduced ATP release compared to parental ( Figure 2B ), indicating that ATP synthase is crucial for ATP release. Mutants Δp and Δ showed reduced ATP release compared to parental ( Figure 2 ), suggesting that cyto oxidases also contribute to ATP release. Mutants Δp and Δ showed reduced ATP release compared to parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating that both ATPase and cyto contribute to ATP. Mutants Δ and Δ showed reduced release compared to parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating that both ATPase and cyto contribute to ATP. Mutants Δ and Δ showed reduced release compared to parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating both ATPase and cyto contribute to ATP. Mutants Δ and Δ showed reduced release compared parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating both ATPase and cyto contribute ATP. Mutants Δ Δ showed reduced release compared parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating ATPase and cyto contribute. Mutants Δ showed reduced release parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating ATPase and cyto. Mutants Δ showed release parental ( Figure 2 ) indicating ATPase cy. Mutants Δ showed release parental ( Figure 2 ) ATPase. Mutants Δ showed parental ( Figure 2 ) cy. Mutants Δ showed parental ( Figure 2 ). Mutants Δ showed ( Figure 2 ) Mutants Δ ( Figure 2 ) Mutants Δ ( Figure 2 ) Mut Δ ( Figure 2 ) Δ ( Figure 2 ) Δ ( Figure 2 ) Δ ( Figure 2 ) Δ ( 2 ) Δ 2 Δ 2 Δ 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

    Title: 
    Article: In children, psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs. Using large-scale longitudinal data, we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children. We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6, 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ), schizophrenia PGS, and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ). Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children. 
 Childhood is the critical developmental period in human life. Cognitive intelligence and mental health in this period significantly impact key life outcomes at later ages, including academic performance, economic productivity, physical health, intelligence, and psychopathology ( Shonkoff, 2012; Walker et al., 2022 ). Literature shows the significant impact of social adversities on cognitive ability and mental health in early childhood. Lower family socioeconomic status ( SES ), particularly household income, is linked to lower neurocognitive ability and higher risk of psychopathology in childhood ( Hair et al., 2015; Noble et al., 2015; Peverill et al., 2021; Tomasi and Volkow, 2021; Weissman et al., 2018 ). Additional to family SES, the importance of neighborhood social environment on children’s neurocognitive ability has been also emphasized ( Gard et al., 2021; Tooley et al., 2020 ). Adverse neighborhood environment, such as the percent of families below poverty line, low education levels, and exposure to violence, is associated with lower cognitive performance ( CP ) and a greater risk for psychosis in children ( Butler et al., 2018; Karcher et al., 2021; Rakesh et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2020 ). Conversely, as protective factors against familial and neighborhood socioeconomic challenges, supportive parenting ( Brody et al., 2017; Brody et al., 2019; Holmes et al., 2018; Luby et al., 2012; Luby et al., 2016 ) and positive school environment ( Gard et al., 2021; Piccolo et al., 2019; Rakesh et al., 2021 ) have been highlighted to improve child cognition and mental health. Psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ), which are prevalent in childhood, indicate the risk of psychosis ( van der Steen et al., 2019; van Os and Reininghaus, 2016 ). Although they are not a direct precursor of schizophrenia, children reporting PLEs in ages of 9–11 years are at higher risk of psychotic disorders in adulthood ( Kelleher and Cannon, 2011; Poulton et al., 2000 ). PLEs also point toward the potential for other psychopathologies including mood, anxiety, and substance disorders ( van der Steen et al., 2019 ), are linked to deficits in cognitive intelligence ( Cannon et al., 2002; Kelleher and Cannon, 2011 ) and show a stronger association with environmental risk factors during childhood than other internalizing/externalizing symptoms ( Karcher et al., 2021 ). Maladaptive cognitive intelligence may act as a mediator for the effects of genetic and environmental risks on the manifestation of psychotic symptoms ( Cannon et al., 2000; Keefe et al., 2006; Reichenberg et al., 2005 ). Abnormal neurodevelopment, influenced by genetic factors, combined with disrupted cognitive processes resulting from socioenvironmental adversity, may eventually give rise to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, relevant to PLEs ( Garety et al., 2001; Howes and Murray, 2014 ). Family studies show a decline in cognitive intelligence preceding psychotic symptoms is related to genetic risk ( Cosway et al., 2000; Curtis et al., 2001 ). In more recent studies, these associations have led to the model positing that cognitive intelligence mediates the genetic risk for psychopathology and PLEs ( Karcher et al., 2022; Pat et al., 2022 ). To minimize potential bias in the estimates of environmental effects, it is crucial to adjust for genetic confounding ( Sariaslan et al., 2016 ), given the substantial genetic influence on intelligence ( Bouchard and McGue, 1981; Deary et al., 2006; Plomin and Spinath, 2004 ) and PLEs ( Bentall and Fernyhough, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2023 ). Recent advances in genetics have led to the development of the polygenic score ( PGS ) approach: a computational method to estimate the genetic loading for a complex trait using statistical associations of each single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) identified by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) ( Cho et al., 2022 ). Particularly, PGS for two related but distinct phenotypes—CP and educational attainment ( EA ) —holds significant importance. As the two most frequently used proxies of cognitive intelligence in genetic studies, PGSs for CP and EA are positively correlated with intelligence, EA, income, self-rated health, and height ( Judd et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2018; Okbay et al., 2022; Selzam et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the PGS for EA is associated with a wide range of biological and social outcomes, including brain morphometry ( Judd et al., 2020; Karcher et al., 2022 ), psychopathologies such as PLEs, autism, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, neuroticism ( Karcher et al., 2022; Okbay et al., 2022 ), cognitive decline ( Joo et al., 2022; Karcher et al., 2022; Ritchie et al., 2020 ), body mass index ( BMI ), time spent watching television, geographic residence ( Abdellaoui et al., 2022 ), and wealth inequality ( Barth et al., 2020 ). Similar to the terms used in prior research, we will collectively refer to these two PGSs of focus as ‘cognitive phenotypes PGSs’ throughout this paper ( Joo et al., 2022; Okbay et al., 2022; Selzam et al., 2019 ). An important gap in the literature is the lack of integrated assessment of the effects of genetic and environmental factors at multiple levels ( e. g., familial vs neighborhood ) to dissect the genetic and environmental effects underlying abnormal cognitive intelligence and the PLEs. Addressing this with large multimodal data will allow for a more complete understanding of the factors related to the development of PLEs. In this study, we systematically explore the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs, mediated through cognitive intelligence. Toward this goal, we firstly assess the associations of cognitive phenotype PGSs, family and neighborhood SES, and supportive environment with children’s cognitive intelligence and longitudinally measured PLEs. To maintain robustness of our assessment, we employed statistical and computational approaches to carefully consider potential confounding. We then test the mediating effect of cognitive intelligence on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs. Our investigation traces these effects from the baseline and through the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, providing a nuanced understanding on the role of cognitive phenotype PGSs, family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive family and school environments in shaping PLEs in children aged 9–10 years. 
 We used the multimodal genetic and environmental data of 11, 878 preadolescent children aged 9–10 years old collected from 21 research sites of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ( ABCD ) Study, one of the largest longitudinal studies for children’s neurodevelopment in the United States. We analyzed the baseline, first year, and second year follow-up datasets included in ABCD Release 4. 0, downloaded on January 25, 2022. After k-nearest neighbor imputation of missing values of covariates ( categorical and continuous ), 6, 602 children were included in the analysis. We used linear mixed model ( LME ) and structural equation modeling ( SEM ) to estimate the effects of cognitive PGS, SES, neighborhood SES, and supportive environment on cognitive and PLE, adjusting for ethnicity and unobserved confounders using confound modeling. The ABCD Study is a large, longitudinal study of children’s neurocognitive, emotional, and social development from ages 9 to 19 years. The study aims to examine the effects of genetic and environmental factors on children’s brain, behavior, cognition, and mental health. The ABCD Study is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ), National Institute of Child Health ( NICHD ), and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA ). The ABC Study has been used to examine the effects of genetic and environmental factors on children’s brain, behavior, cognition, and mental health ( et al.,2020; et al.,202; et al.202; et al.202; et al.202; et.202; et al.202; et.202; et.202; et.202; et.202; et.202; et.202; et.202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et202.202; et.202;202; et.202;202 et.202;202; et202.202; et202.202; et.202;202; et202.202;202 et.202;202 et.202;202 et.202;202 et202.202; et.202;202 et202.202; et.202;202 et202.202; et202.202 et202;.202 et202;202.202 et202.202; et202202.202 et202.202 et202202.202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202202

    Title: 
    Article: The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses via modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic regions, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. 
 The embryonic development of the mammalian brain is orchestrated by a highly coordinated cascade of cellular and molecular events. This cascade engages distinct signaling pathways activated by gradients of diffusing morphogens, including FGFs, BMPs, SHH, and WNTs ( Borello and Pierani, 2010; Takahashi and Liu, 2006; Rubenstein, 2008; Hoch et al., 2009; Guillemot and Zimmer, 2011 ). These morphogens instruct neural progenitors with spatial and temporal ‘coordinates’ along the dorsoventral ( D/V ) and anteroposterior ( A/P ) brain axes, modulating early expression gradients of key developmental genes in a dose-dependent manner. These initial stages lay the foundation for further critical processes in brain development, such as progenitor proliferation, cell migration, neuronal differentiation, and circuit formation. Disruption of any of these mechanisms can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities, and contribute to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders ( NDDs ). FGF ligands and their receptors play pivotal roles in neural plate patterning ( Guillemot and Zimmer, 2011 ), and disruptions in FGF signaling pathways have been implicated in various brain malformations ( Turner et al., 2016 ) and significant cortical development defects ( Sun et al., 2023; Shin et al., 2004; Hébert et al., 2003 ). Notably, although some functional redundancy exists among FGF factors ( Turner et al., 2016 ), FGF8 stands out as a primary regulator of regional patterning and brain development. During early development, FGF8 is essential in establishing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary ( Harada et al., 2016; Lee et al., 1997 ) - a region known as the isthmus, which acts as a brain organizer - where the FGF8 diffusing gradient controls the patterning of posterior brain regions ( Lee et al., 1997; Mason et al., 2000; Ye et al., 1998; Crossley et al., 1996 ). During the development of telencephalic vesicles, FGF8 diffuses from the anterior neural ridge ( ANR; Toyoda et al., 2010; Hoch et al., 2015 ), located at the most anterior pole, creating a gradient that regulates proliferation, apoptosis, regionalization, and identity acquisition along cortical axes ( Toyoda et al., 2010; Storm et al., 2006; Storm et al., 2003; Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001; Sato et al., 2017; Cholfin and Rubenstein, 2007; Cholfin and Rubenstein, 2008; Garel et al., 2003 ). Consistently, FGF8 diffusion is essential for the regulation of key telencephalic genes such as Foxg1 ( Shimamura and Rubenstein, 1997 ), a transcription factor required for the regionalization and growth of telencephalic vesicles. Additionally, FGF8 promotes cortical expansion by activating the ERK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing self-renewal and increasing the pool of cortical radial glia cells ( Sun et al., 2023 ). FGFs exert their functions by binding to four highly conserved FGF receptors ( FGFRs; Klimaschewski and Claus, 2021 ) ; among those, FGFR3 plays a specific role in regulating brain size by influencing progenitor proliferation and apoptosis ( Inglis-Broadgate et al., 2005 ) and is essential for the correct formation and regionalization of the occipitotemporal cortex ( Thomson et al., 2009; Thomson et al., 2007 ). Given their multiple roles during embryonic ( Guillemot and Zimmer, 2011; Rubenstein, 2011 ) and adult age ( Turner et al., 2016; Klimaschewski and Claus, 2021 ), it is not surprising that FGF factors have been implicated in the onset of several NDDs ( Amaral et al., 2008 ), and adult psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia ( Klimaschewski and Claus, 2021; Stevens et al., 2010 ). FGF8 exerts its effects by modulating key developmental genes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly control critical neurogenesis processes. Dysregulation of these genes can lead to various pathological conditions. A notable example is the nuclear receptor Nr2f1, which is regulated by the FGF8 pathway and plays several roles during mouse telencephalic development ( Bertacchi et al., 2019; Tocco et al., 2021 ). Mutations in the NR2F1 gene lead to an emerging NDD, called Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome ( BBSOAS ), a condition characterized by cognitive and visual impairments ( Chen et al., 2016; Bosch et al., 2014; Rech et al., 2020; Bertacchi et al., 2022 ). The anterior FGF8 telencephalic gradient negatively regulates Nr2f1 during early mouse development ( Sansom et al., 2005; Assimacopoulos et al., 2012 ), allowing its expression to follow an anterior-low to posterior-high gradient, which is crucial for specifying areal identities in the dorsal telencephalon ( Liu et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 1994; Tripodi et al., 2004; Armentano et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2001; Armentano et al., 2007 ). Other FGF8 downstream targets promote anterior identity by inhibiting Nr2f1 ( O’Leary et al., 2007; O’Leary and Sahara, 2008 ), creating a cross-talk where FGFs and Nr2f1 exert opposite effects on the A/P cortical axis ( Bertacchi et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, human NR2F1 also exhibits a low anterior to high posterior expression gradient in the early telencephalon ( Foglio et al., 2021; Alzu’bi et al., 2017a; Clowry et al., 2018 ), raising the possibility that FGFs could modulate similar downstream effector genes in the human brain. However, despite significant advances in understanding FGF-related physiology and pathology, most studies have relied on animal ( often murine ) models, where FGF depletion results in severe phenotypes ( Meyers et al., 1998; Sun et al., 1999; Reifers et al., 1998; Shanmugalingam et al., 2000 ). Hence, the role of FGFs, particularly FGF8, in human progenitor cells and neurons remains poorly understood, as does the contribution of FGF8 signaling and its target gene regulation in human diseases. Self-organizing human brain organoids offer an unprecedented tool for modeling early neural development in vitro, offering an ethical and practical alternative to studying early fetal brain development ( Velasco et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2019; Chiaradia and Lancaster, 2020; Quadrato et al., 2017; Lancaster et al., 2013; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Renner et al., 2017; Bagley et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2020 ). Previous studies utilizing 2D neural protocols ( Chambers et al., 2009; Smukler et al., 2006; Gaspard et al., 2009 ), followed by adaptations for 3D organoid protocols ( Kadoshima et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2016 ), demonstrated that pluripotent cells adopt a dorsal/anterior ( i. e. telencephalic ) or ventral ( i. e. mesencephalic ) fate in response to patterning cues. In this study, we used hiPSC-derived organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of F8 on telenceph and mesenceph development. We found that F8 increases cellular heterogeneity leading to distinct telph and mesph-like domains in multi-regional organoids Within telph regions, F8 affects anteroposter and dorsovent identity of neural progenitors and the balance GABA and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous network activity Moreover, F8 modulates key regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders Overall, our results show that8 is directly involved in pattering and cellular in human organ and modulating genes with normal and pathological development

    Title: 
    Article: Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life. As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In Drosophila, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory ( LTM ). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ). Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. 
 The development of behavioral rhythms such as sleep-wake patterns is critical for brain development ( Vallone et al., 2007 ). Indeed, early life circadian disruptions in rodents negatively impacts adult behaviors, neuronal morphology, and circadian physiology ( Varcoe et al., 2016; Mendez et al., 2016; Ameen et al., 2022 ). Likewise, in humans, disruptions in sleep and rhythms during development are a common co-morbidity in neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD and autism ( Hoffmire et al., 2014; Krakowiak et al., 2008; Kotagal, 2015; Ednick et al., 2009 ). Although mechanisms encoding the molecular clock are well understood, little is known about how rhythmic behaviors first emerge ( Vallone et al., 2007; Carmona-Alcocer et al., 2018; Sehgal et al., 1992; Poe et al., 2022 ). In particular, cues that trigger the consolidation of sleep and waking behaviors as development proceeds are unclear ( Blumberg et al., 2005; Blumberg et al., 2014; Frank et al., 2017; Frank, 2020 ). A key potential factor in the maturation of sleep patterns is the coincident change in feeding and metabolism during development. Early in development, most young animals must obtain enough nutrients to ensure proper growth ( Ghosh et al., 2023 ). Yet, developing organisms must also sleep to support nervous system development ( Vallone et al., 2007 ). These conflicting needs ( feeding vs. quiescence ) result in rapid transitions between sleeping and feeding states early in life ( Adair and Bauchner, 1993; Levin and Stern, 1975 ). As development proceeds, nutritional intake and storage capacity increase, allowing for the consolidation of feeding and sleep to specific times of day ( Li et al., 2018 ). These changes in nutritional storage capacity are likely conserved as mammalian body composition and nutritional capacity change over infant development ( Toro-Ramos et al., 2015 ) and Drosophila show rapid increases in overall larval body size including the size of the fat body ( used for nutrient storage ) across development ( Butterworth et al., 1988; Jacobs et al., 2020 ). However, the role that developmental change in metabolic drive plays in regulating the consolidation of behavioral rhythms is not known. In adult Drosophila, sleep and feeding behaviors are consolidated to specific times of day with flies eating more in the day than the night ( Barber et al., 2016 ). Yet, early in development, sleep in 2nd instar Drosophila larvae ( L2 ) lacks a circadian pattern ( Poe et al., 2023 ). We previously determined that sleep-wake rhythms are initiated in early 3rd instar Drosophila larvae ( L3 ) ( 72 hr AEL ). DN1a clock neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh44 arousal output neurons to drive the consolidation of sleep in L3. Development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3 resulting in the emergence of long-term memory ( LTM ) capabilities at the L3 stage but not before ( Poe et al., 2023 ). Here, we identify the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae. We demonstrate that developmental changes to energetic demands drive consolidation of periods of sleep and feeding across the day as animals mature. While endogenous deeper sleep in L3 facilitates LTM, we find that experimentally inducing deep sleep prematurely in L2 is detrimental to development and does not improve LTM performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that DN1a-Dh44 circuit formation is developmentally plastic, as rearing on an insufficient nutritional environment prevents establishment of this neural connection. Finally, we find that Dh44 neurons require glucose metabolic genes to promote sleep-wake rhythm development, suggesting that these neurons sense the nutritional environment to promote circadian-sleep crosstalk. 
 The emergence of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae is advantageous as it enables long-term memory capabilities at the L3 stage ( Poe et al., 2023 ). Less mature larvae ( L2 ) do not exhibit consolidated sleep-wake patterns, prompting us to ask why rhythmic behaviors do not emerge earlier in life. To determine if the absence of rhythmic sleep-wake patterns in L2 might be related to feeding patterns, we examined larval feeding rate ( # mouth hook contractions in a 5-min period ) under constant conditions at 4 times across the day ( Circadian Time [CT] 1, CT7, CT13, and CT19 ) in developmentally age-matched 2nd ( L2 ) and early 3rd instar ( L3; 72 hr AEL ) larvae. While we observed no differences in feeding rate across the day in L2, we found that L3 show diurnal differences in feeding with higher feeding rate during the subjective day compared to the subjective night ( Figure 1A and B ). Analysis of total food intake indicated that L2 consume the same amount at CT1 and CT13; however, L3 consume more at CT1 than at CT13 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). To assess whether the daily pattern of feeding in early L3 is dependent on the canonical circadian biological clock, we examined feeding rate in null mutants for the clock gene tim ( Konopka and Benzer, 1971 ). We observed no differences in feeding rate across the day in L3 tim mutants indicating that the daily feeding pattern requires a functioning molecular clock ( Figure 1C ). These findings underscore the tight relationship between sleep and feeding across development as diurnal differences in sleep emerge concurrently at the L3 stage ( Poe et al., 2023 ). To further investigate how the emergence of circadian sleep is related to changes in feeding patterns during development, we asked whether enforcing a constant ( immature ) feeding pattern at the L3 stage affects sleep-wake rhythms. First, we devised a nutritional paradigm with reduced sugar content but otherwise normal food ( low sugar, 1. 2% glucose, L. S. ). Critically, this paradigm did not affect any measures of larval growth or development ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F ) in contrast to numerous other diets that were assessed. We found that the feeding pattern in L3 raised on L. S. food closely resembled that of L2 on normal food ( 8% glucose ), with feeding spread out across the day ( Figure 1D; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). Compared to L3 raised on control food, this paradigm was also associated with loss of diurnal differences in sleep duration, sleep bout number, and arousal threshold ( indicating less deep sleep ) ( Figure 1E and F; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C ). Next, to avoid chronic effects of this dietary manipulation, we acutely stimulated feeding in L3 reared on normal food using thermogenetic activation of NPF +neurons ( Figure 2A; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A; Wu et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2017 ). Like L. S. conditions, enforcing a constant feeding pattern through NPF +neuron activation led to loss of sleep rhythms and loss of deep sleep ( higher arousal threshold ) in L3 ( Figure 2B–E; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E ). Disruption to circadian sleep and/or to deeper sleep stages during development is associated with impairments in long-term memory formation ( Ameen et al., 2022; Konrad et al., 2016; Seehagen et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2019; Smarr et al., 2017 ). We next asked if the loss of deeper sleep observed in animals reared on L. S food would impact LTM. We trained L3 on normal food or L. S food to associate an odor with electric shock and tested for LTM 24 hr later. L reared on normal food exhibited robust LTM while those reared on L S food showed impaired LTM ( Figure 3A ). These results suggest that the developmental changes in sleep patterns are critical for the emergence of long-term memory. Finally, we asked whether the development of the DN1-Dh44 circuit is influenced by the nutritional environment. We found that rearing on L S food prevented the anatomical and functional connection between DN1 and Dh44 neurons ( Figure 3— supplement 1 ). In contrast, rearing on normal food did not affect the development of this circuit ( Figure 3— supplement ). To understand how Dh44 neurons sense the nutritional environment, we examined the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism in Dh neurons. We found that Dh44 neurons express genes involved in glucose sensing and metabolism ( Figure 3— supplement ). These results suggest that Dh44 neurons use glucose to sense the nutritional environment to drive the development of circadian rhythms. In conclusion, our data indicate that changes in nutritional demands drive the emergence of sleepake rhythms in Drosila larvae. Developmental changes in feeding and storage capacity allow for consolidation of sleep and feeding to specific times of the day. Disruptions to these rhythms are associated with impairments in long-term memory. The development of the DN-Dh circuit is influenced by the nutritional environment and Dh neurons use glucose to sense the environment to drive circadian rhythms. 
The final answer is: 

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

The study investigates the development of sleep-wake patterns in Drosila larvae and their relationship to nutritional status. The researchers found that in the 2nd instar larval stage, sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar stage. Forcing mature larvae to adopt immature feeding strategies disrupts sleepake rhythms and ability to exhibit long-term memory. The development of the clock circuit is influenced by the larval nutritional environment, and Dh neurons use glucose to sense the environment to drive circadian rhythms. The study suggests that changes in energetic demands trigger the formation of sleep-circuits and behaviors, and disruptions to rhythms are associated with impairments in long-term memory.

Key findings:

* In 2ndar larvae, sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but become organized into daily patterns by 3rd stage
* Forcing larvae to adopt immature feeding strategies disrupts sleepake and ability to exhibit long-term memory
* Development of clock is influenced by larval nutritional environment
* Dh neurons use glucose to sense environment to drive circadian
* Disruptions to rhythms associated with impairments in long-term memory

The study highlights the importance of nutritional status in the development of sleepake in Dila and its relationship to long-term memory.

    Title: 
    Article: Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive. By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ), we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1. We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53%, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes. 
 Newton’s laws of motion underpin animal locomotion, from fine-scale maneuvers to long-distance migrations ( Biewener and Patek, 2018 ). As speed increases or during migration involving sustained movement over long distances, animals often move in coordinated groups: e. g., migratory birds in V-formation ( Weimerskirch et al., 2001 ), ducklings swimming in formation ( Fish, 1995 ), cyclists in a peloton ( Blocken et al., 2018 ), elite marathon runners ( Ito, 2007 ), and fish schools ( Weihs, 1973 ). To overcome gravitational or fluid dynamic resistance to forward motion, animals use both aerobic and glycolytic metabolism ( oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation at the cellular level ) to generate energy and sustain movement in the air, on land, and in the water. In water, a fluid that is 50 times more viscous than air and contains much less O2 per Kg than air, the need for aquatic animals to reduce fluid dynamic drag for energy conservation is even greater than for aerial or terrestrial locomotion. Hence, we use fish schooling behavior as a model system to explore whether the fluid dynamics of collective movement ( active and directional movement of animal groups along a common trajectory Zhang and Lauder, 2023 ) can enable energetic savings compared to locomotion by a solitary individual. Fish schooling behaviors are some of the most prominent social and group activities exhibited by vertebrates. Fish may school for many reasons, including foraging, reproduction, and migration, and fish schools often exhibit high-speed movement during evasion from predators. Hence, natural selection can put pressure on the formation of schools and individual interactions within a school. Besides ‘safety in numbers’ where individuals in a large school have a lower probability of becoming prey, can there be more tangible energetic benefits of high-speed swimming as a school? Since fluid drag scales as velocity squared ( Vogel, 1981 ), movement at higher speeds places a premium on mechanisms to conserve energy. Fast and unsustainable swimming is fueled by aerobic metabolism with a major contribution from anaerobic glycolysis ( LaForgia et al., 2006; Brett, 1964 ). During high-speed swimming aerobic capacity is maximized ( Brett, 1964 ), and energy use is more likely to compete with other activities than in low-speed swimming which only occupies a small portion of aerobic capacity. The direct consequences of unsustainably engaging anaerobic glycolysis include both fatigue and metabolic perturbation ( such as changing blood acidity ) that need time to recover after bouts of intense locomotion. Animals become vulnerable during recovery because of their hindered ability to repeat peak locomotor performance in the presence of predators. Another factor of importance in the experimental evaluation of the energetic cost of collective locomotion in fishes is that endurance and efficiency are often key to achieving lifetime fitness, especially in fish species that undergo significant migrations. Fish groups usually undergo long-distance migrations at slow speeds ranging from 0. 25 to 1. 0 BL s–1 as recorded by tags on migrating fish ( Appendix 1—figure 1 ). The common migratory speed of ~1 BL s–1 for marine and anadromous fish could be related to the minimum aerobic cost of transport ( Beamish, 1978 ). However, there is currently no direct measurement of the absolute cost of teleost fish locomotion demonstrating a minimum group metabolic rate ( ṀO2 ) at an optimal speed ( Uopt ). Fish schools in nature swim over a wide range of speeds ( Appendix 1—figure 1 ) but no study has directly characterized the total energy expenditure ( TEE ), and accounted for the potentially substantial anaerobic metabolic costs involved in higher speed locomotion. As a result, the swimming TEE performance curve of fish schools from the minimum swimming speed to the critical swimming speed ( Ucrit ) has not yet been measured. More broadly, despite the widespread notion that collective motion saves energy ( Weihs, 1973 ), very few studies have directly measured the energetic cost of collective movement compared to the cost of movement by solitary individuals. In the canonical case of V-formation flight in birds, energetic saving is exclusively inferred from indirect measurements, for example, heart rate ( Weimerskirch et al., 2001 ), and flapping frequency and phase ( Portugal et al., 2014; Table 1 ). There are no direct measurements of metabolic energy consumption of collective movement in birds, and indeed this would be extremely challenging to accomplish. Although some energetic aspects of schooling fishes have been studied ( Parker, 1973; Abrahams and Colgan, 1985; Burgerhout et al., 2013; Currier et al., 2021; Hvas and Oppedal, 2019 ), these studies have analyzed a limited range of speeds and focused on aerobic metabolism ( see Table 1 ). In fact, several field and laboratory kinematic studies suggest that both bird flocks and fish schools do not always conserve aerobic energy ( Hvas and Oppedal, 2019; Partridge and Pitcher, 1979; Usherwood et al., 2011 ) and indicate that moving in a group can actually involve increased costs. Without directly measuring the energetic cost of movement, inferences solely based on kinematics do not include complex group interactions, and the interaction between collective behavior and fluid dynamics. Consequently, we do not yet have a holistic and mechanistic view of where and how the collective movement by fish might conserve energy. For swimming fish, fluid dynamic experiments have shown how collective movement can improve swimming efficiency due to interactions among deforming bodies and through interactions between moving animals and the local fluid environment ( these energy-saving mechanisms are summarized in Figure 1 ). Our current understanding of energy saving mechanisms during collective locomotion in fishes is largely based on computational fluid dynamic models with a few analyses using robotic systems ( Weihs, 1973; Li et al., 2020; Kelly and Menzer, 2023; Fish et al., 2016; Kurt and Moored, 2018 ) at low speed, but the link between such models and fish metabolic energy saving over a wide speed range is not yet established. We expect that the need to conserve energy in animals moving against air or water resistance should be greater at higher speeds. We hypothesize that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority ( >50% ) of their aerobic capacity. Our secondary objective is to determine the differences ( if any ) between the swimming performance curves ( metabolic rate versus speed ) of solitary fish and fish schools. To evaluate these hypotheses, we directly measured both the aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fishes over a wide range of water velocities ( 0. 3–8. 0 body lengths s–1; BL s–1 ), and then compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish. We equipped a high-resolution ( see materials and methods for our approach to enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in our respirometer ) swim-tunnel respirometer with two orthogonal high-speed cameras to quantify three-dimensional ( 3-D ) fish kinematics. This enabled us to simultaneously measure energetics, 3-D dynamics of fish schools ( n=5 replicate schools ), and the kinematics of solitary fish ( n=5 ) of a model species, giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ), that exhibits an active directional group swimming from near still water to maximum sustained speeds ( equivalent to a Reynolds number range of 6. 4•103–1. 8•105; Appendix 1—figure 2 ), using a Ucrit test. 
 We discovered that both solitary fish and fish schools have a concave upward shaped aerobic metabolic rate ( ṀO2 ) -speed curve over the lower portion of their speed range ( 0. 3–3 BL s–1, Figure 2C, D ). The aerobic locomotor cost at 0. 3–3 BL s–1 showed no statistical difference between solitary fish and fish schools ( F1, 80≤ 2. 40, p > 0. 05 ). However, at speeds above 3 BL–1, fish in schools had a significantly lower Ṁ2 than solitary fish ( F, 80 2 4. 5, p < 0.01 ) with a minimum at 1 BL–1 ( Figure 2C, D ). We found that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per beat by up to 56% compared to solitary ( Figure 3 A ). When reaching their maximum sustained speed, swimming fish in schools had 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy compared to solitary ( Figure 3 ), lowering the TEE and cost of transport by up to 53%, the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish schools also recovered from exercise 43 faster than solitary ( Figure 4 ). The anaerobic energetic savings when fish swim in schools at high speeds can improve both peak and repeated performance, likely beneficial for evading predators. These savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated locomotion in fishes.

    Title: 
    Article: Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases. 
 Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the sentinels of the lung and the first responders to respiratory insults such as infection. Despite a large body of evidence indicating that these tissue resident AM have a distinct phenotype and function to peripherally derived macrophages, there remains a significant lack of data regarding human AM function and plasticity in response to infection and their ability to change under the influence of Th1 or Th2 environments. Macrophage function exists on a spectrum of activation states based on tissue residency, ontogeny, cytokine milieu and the plasticity of the macrophage in response to environmental factors ( Huang et al., 2018; Ginhoux et al., 2010 ). Much of the research has focused on the contribution of metabolic pathways to polarising macrophages into distinct pro-inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes ( Wang et al., 2018 ). There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th1 or Th2 microenvironments induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-4 respectively, in human macrophages, especially in tissue resident macrophages, such as AM. A knowledge gap remains as to whether the tissue resident AM is metabolically and functionally plastic and therefore capable of mounting effective pro-inflammatory responses despite its homeostatic, regulatory tissue resident phenotype. Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming ( Vijayan et al., 2019; Tannahill et al., 2013 ). Since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung, we sought to determine the plasticity of AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ). Using primary human AM and MDM, we modelled Th1 and Th2 microenvironments with the addition of IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively. To further examine the function of IFN-γ or IL-4 primed macrophages, we stimulated cells with the gram-negative bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), or whole bacteria, irradiated Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb; iH37Rv ). Firstly, we assessed the metabolic phenotype of unprimed human AM, or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4. IFN-γ significantly increased the cellular energetics of both human AM and MDM. Furthermore, subsequent stimulation led to an increase in the extracellular acidification rate ( ECAR ), a surrogate marker of glycolysis in both macrophages. Therefore, using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose ( 2DG ) we then examined the mechanistic role of glycolysis in the phenotypic and functional plasticity of both AM and MDM. Herein the functional plasticity is defined as the ability of primed macrophages to differentially alter cytokine production in response to bacterial stimuli whereas the phenotypic plasticity is defined by alterations in surface expression of activation markers. These data demonstrate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ or IL-4 differently than MDM. These novel data demonstrate differential metabolic responses within human macrophage subpopulations that are linked with functionality. Furthermore, these data address a knowledge gap in human respiratory innate immunology and provide evidence that the AM is a tractable target to support human respiratory health. 
 AM alter their metabolism in response to Mtb ( Gleeson et al., 2016 ). Human macrophages also undergo a rapid increase in ECAR early in response to activation ( Ó Maoldomhnaigh et al., 2021a ) and these pathways can be pharmacologically manipulated ( Cox et al., 2020; Phelan et al., 2020 ). The metabolic and functional plasticity of human AM remains unexplored; however, evidence shows they express both ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ markers ( Mitsi et al., 2018 ). Murine AM can be reprogrammed through an IFN-γ-dependent mechanism ( Yao et al., 2018 ). We therefore sought to examine whether priming human AM with IFN-γ compared with IL-4 or unprimed AM, could influence their metabolic function and response to bacterial stimuli. We stimulated with whole bacteria; Mtb ( iH37Rv ) or gram-negative cell wall component; LPS. AM were plated in a Seahorse plate and primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 ( both 10 ng/ml ) for 24 hr or left unprimed. AM ECAR and oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) were recorded for 30 min at baseline. AM were then stimulated in the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer with medium ( control ), iH37Rv ( MOI; 1–10 ) or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) and ECAR and OCR were continuously monitored ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A&B ). At 150 min post stimulation fold change compared to unprimed unstimulated AM was calculated for ECAR ( Figure 1A ) and OCR ( Figure 1B ). IFN-γ priming significantly increased the ECAR and OCR of unstimulated human AM compared with control or IL-4 primed AM ( Figure 1A and B ). Upon stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS, AM significantly increased ECAR compared to their respective unstimulated controls, regardless of cytokine priming ( Figure 1A ). IFN-γ primed and subsequently stimulated AM exhibited a significantly increased ECAR compared with stimulated control or IL-4 primed AM ( Figure 1A ). IL-4 primed iH37Rv stimulated AM increased ECAR to similar extent as unprimed controls ( Figure 1A; left ). Conversely, IL-4 primed AM stimulated with LPS AM did not increase their ECAR to the same extent as controls ( Figure 1A; right ), suggesting that IL-4 reduces the AM ability to increase ECAR in response to LPS stimulation. IFN-γ significantly increased the OCR of AM in response to stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS, and had enhanced OCR compared with other stimulated controls ( Figure 1B ). These data indicate that priming human AM with IFN-γ increases both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, which is then further increased upon stimulation. Since IFN-γ priming increased cellular energetics in the AM at baseline, we calculated percent change in ECAR and OCR from the baseline rate of each group in order to assess if IFN-γ or IL-4 primed AM have altered capacity to change their metabolism in response to stimulation ( Figure 1C and D ). This was carried out to equalise all the primed data sets at baseline before stimulation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D ). These data indicate that whilst the peak of glycolysis is elevated in IFN-γ primed AM ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ), all AM have a similar capacity to increase glycolysis upon stimulation when baseline differences in metabolism were adjusted for the effects of cytokine priming ( Figure 1C ). IFN-γ increased the percent change in OCR of AM in response to both bacterial stimuli compared to the unstimulated IFN-γ primed control ( Figure 1D ). These data indicate that priming AM alters the metabolic baselines of human tissue resident macrophages, but not their capacity to increase metabolism in response to stimuli. We next examined the mechanistic role of glycol in the phenotypic and functional plasticity of human macrophages using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deglucose ( 2DG ). AM were primed with IF-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr and then stimulated with LPS or i37v in the presence or absence of 2DG ( 5mM ) for 30 min ECAR and OCR were recorded ( Figure 2A and B ). IF- primed AM exhibited a significant increase in EC and OCR in response to LPS ( Figure 2A and B ) whereas IL-4 prim AM did not ( Figure 2A and B ). In the presence of 2DG, IF- primed AM did not increase EC or OCR in response to LPS ( Figure 2A and B ) whereas IL-4 prim AM did ( Figure 2 and B ). These data indicate that glycol is required for the phenotypic and functional plasticity of IF-primed AM but not IL-4 primed macrophages. We then examined the effect of 2 on cytokine production in response to LPS ( Figure 3 ). IF-prim AM produced significantly more TNF and IL-1β in response to LPS compared to IL-4 prim AM ( Figure 3 ). In the presence of 2, IF-prim AM produced significantly less TN and IL-1β ( Figure 3 ) whereas IL- prim AM produced more ( Figure 3 ). These data indicate that glycol is required for the functional plasticity of IF-prim macroph but not IL-4 prim macroph. We also examined the effect of 2 on the expression of activation markers HLA-DR and CD40 ( Figure 4 ). IF-prim AM exhibited increased HLA-DR and CD40 in response to LPS ( Figure 4 ) whereas IL- prim did not ( Figure 4 ). In the presence 2, IF-prim did not increase HLA and CD40 ( Figure 4 ) whereas IL- prim did ( Figure 4 ). These data indicate that glycol is required for the phenotypic plasticity of IF-prim macro but not IL- prim macro. We also examined the effect of 2 on the expression of HLA and CD ( Figure 5 ) IF-prim exhibited increased H and CD in response to L ( Figure 5 ) whereas IL prim did not ( Figure 5. In the presence 2, IFprim did not increase H and CD ( Figure 5 ) whereas IL prim did ( Figure 5. These data indicate that glycol is required for the phenotyp plasticity of IFprim macro but not IL prim macro. Overall, these data demonstrate that glycol is required for the phenotyp and functional plasticity of IF-prim macroph but not IL- prim macro. We then examined the effect of 2 on cytokine production in response to i37v ( Figure 6 ) IF-prim produced significantly more TN and IL-1β in response to i37 compared to IL- prim ( Figure 6 ) In the presence 2, IFprim produced less TN and IL-β ( Figure 6 whereas IL prim produced more ( Figure 6. These indicate that glycol is required for functional plasticity of IFprim macro but not IL prim. We also examined the effect 2 on expression of activation markers HLA and CD ( Figure 7 ) IFprim increased H and CD in response to i37 ( Figure 7 whereas IL did not ( Figure 7 In the presence 2, IFprim did not increase H and CD ( Figure 7 whereas IL did Figure 7. These indicate that glycol is required for phenotyp plasticity of IFprim but not IL

    Title: 
    Article: For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here, we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day. 
 Many, navigating animals use the position of the sun or moon to guide their movement ( Jander, 1957; Klotz and Reid, 1993; Perez et al., 1997; Dacke et al., 2014; Warrant and Dacke, 2016; Freas and Cheng, 2022 ). Yet these celestial bodies are not always directly visible, often obscured by clouds, the canopy, or after passing below the horizon, resulting in gaps for navigation relying solely upon direct visual detection. Animals hence rely on the pattern of polarised skylight, which is accessible even when the celestial bodies are occluded to some extent ( Horváth et al., 2014 ). When the electromagnetic field of light oscillates in a directionally predictable manner, it is defined as polarised. The type of polarisation describes the pattern of this oscillating electromagnetic field. When this oscillation is in a single plane, this light is defined as linearly polarised. The electric field of light can form other patterns, such as circular polarisation, with the field spiralling in three dimensions as a plane wave propagates. Linearly polarised sunlight comprises light waves which occur along a single plane produced as a by-product of light passing through the upper atmosphere ( Horváth and Varjú, 2004; Horváth et al., 2014 ). The scattering of this light creates an e-vector pattern in the sky, which is arranged in concentric circles around the sun or moon’s position with the maximum degree of polarisation located 90° from the source. Hence when the sun/moon is near the horizon, the pattern of polarised skylight is particularly simple with uniform direction of polarisation approximately parallel to the north-south axes ( Dacke et al., 1999; Dacke et al., 2003; Reid et al., 2011; Zeil et al., 2014 ). The pattern’s stability makes the sky’s polarisation a useful directional cue for orientation ( Wehner and Müller, 2006; Reid et al., 2011; Lebhardt and Ronacher, 2014; Warrant and Dacke, 2016; Freas et al., 2017b; Freas et al., 2019b; Freas and Spetch, 2023 ), which insects detect through specialised photoreceptors located in the dorsal rim area of their eyes ( Labhart and Meyer, 1999; Homberg and Paech, 2002; el Jundi et al., 2015 ). Like solar polarisation, though a million times weaker, the moon reflects sunlight, producing a polarised moonlight pattern emanating from the moon’s position in the night sky ( Gál et al., 2001 ). Given that the moon creates a much dimmer version of the polarisation pattern formed around the sun, only night-navigating insects with eyes highly specialised for low-light detection may be able to rely on this pattern to orient and navigate to goals. Currently, only dung beetles ( the nocturnal Scarabaeus satyrus and S. zambesianus and the diurnal Scarabaeus ( Kheper ) lamarcki ) are known to attend to moonlight polarisation patterns during their movement ( Dacke et al., 2003; Dacke et al., 2004; Dacke et al., 2011; Smolka et al., 2016; Foster et al., 2019 ). Yet interestingly, these beetles do not use moonlight to navigate, instead relying on this pattern to keep moving straight in order to roll their dung balls expeditiously away from a central dung pile. As such, this cue has only been documented for heading maintenance over short periods. While it has been theorised that this ability to detect the much dimmer polarisation pattern produced by the moon may be present across nocturnal insects more broadly, including nocturnal bees and crickets ( Herzmann and Labhart, 1989; Greiner et al., 2007; Rost and Honegger, 1987 ), there is currently no behavioural evidence for its use in goal-directed navigation. We sought such evidence in nocturnal bull ants. The large-eyed Myrmecia ants have several species that restrict the majority of their navigation to evening twilight ( outbound ) and morning twilight ( inbound ), respectively ( Narendra et al., 2017 ). We know that two well-studied nocturnal ant species, Myrmecia pyriformis, and Myrmecia midas, use the overhead solar polarised light pattern, which is still visible during the twilight period to derive compass information ( Reid et al., 2011; Freas et al., 2017b; Freas et al., 2017c; Freas et al., 2018 ). Because the information required for visual navigation degrades beyond twilight, it has been suggested that animals tend to be less active at night. However, a small proportion of M. pyriformis foragers leave the nest ( 10. 7% of daily foraging force ) or return home during the night ( 13. 3% of daily foraging force ) ( Reid et al., 2013 ). In M. midas, this nocturnal activity is even more pronounced with the majority of the foraging force returning during the night ( 62. 8% of daily foraging force ) along with a minority of foragers leaving the nest during the night ( 26. 2% of daily foraging force ) ( Freas et al., 2017b ). Nocturnal bull ants navigate using a combination of learned visual cues ( Freas et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2020; Deeti et al., 2023 ) and homing vectors obtained by integrating pedometric and celestial compass information ( Wehner and Srinivasan, 2003Wittlinger et al., 2006; Wehner, 2020 ). This ‘true nocturnal navigation’ is likely aided by the increase in the light intensity provided by the moon’s presence. In M. pyriformis, on ‘full-moon’ nights there was a significantly greater proportion of foragers leaving the nest at night compared to a ‘new-moon’ night ( Reid et al., 2013 ). This additional light at night may enhance terrestrial visual features foragers have learned and, therefore, assist in visual guidance. In addition, the moon and the lunar polarisation pattern also likely provide compass information, allowing foragers to acquire or follow a homing vector. Several arthropods, including ants and bees, directly track the moon’s position to obtain compass information ( Jander, 1957; Klotz and Reid, 1993; Dacke et al., 2004; Ugolini et al., 2013 ). But given the moon may be occluded by clouds or overhanging canopy we aim to identify here whether the lunar polarised skylight can also be used by ants for homing. In the current study, we studied foraging ants’ ability to orient during lunar twilight, by placing and rotating a linear polarising filter over them as they returned to the nest ( Figure 1A ). This rotation blocks the ambient e-vector direction of the sky above the navigator, replacing it with an artificial e-vector of polarisation that is rotated ±45° off the ambient pattern. We also explored whether these navigators weigh their attendance to polarised moonlight across the lunar cycle, since during quarter-moon and crescent-moon nights, smaller portions of the moon’s surface reflect sunlight ( as well as moonless nights when no ambient e-vector is present ). Finally, we characterised changes in weighting that these ant navigators give polarised moonlight, as a function of the moon’s overnight consistency in the sky ( waxing or waning ). Our results show that nocturnal ants use polarised moonlight to navigate during the night, rotating their headings in response to the polarised pattern above them ( Figure 2 ). We found that these ants use this cue throughout the lunar cycle, even during quarter-moon and crescent-moon nights when polarised levels are at their lowest ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, we show that the incorporation of polar moonlight into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night ( Figure 4 ) as polar sunlight is incorporated during the day. Our results demonstrate that nocturnal ants rely on polarised moonlight to navigate during the night, even when the sun is not visible. This is the first evidence for the use of polarised moonlight in goal-directed navigation in nocturnal animals.

    Title: 
    Article: Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure. 
 Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight ( Palmer, 2017 ). The first pterosaurs, the non-pterodactyloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base ( Frey et al., 2003 ), similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor ( Persons and Currie, 2012 ). Many of these tails end in a soft tissue 'vane' ( Marsh, 1882; Döderlein, 1929; Frey et al., 2003; Figure 1 ), which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. A primary role in display has also been suggested ( O’Brien et al., 2018 ), given ontogenetic shape changes in the vane and the fact that, unlike most aircraft, flying animals do not need vertical control surfaces to be yaw-stable during turns ( Bowers, 2016 ). The vanes have been interpreted as steering aids ( Frey et al., 2003 ). The length and stiffening of the tails suggest that they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control, as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails ( Persons and Currie, 2012 ). Such dynamic control could greatly improve maneuverability and/or stability. However, vane fluttering would be extremely costly and destabilising unless the vane was tensioned while under aerodynamic load. Tail vanes feature thick, evenly spaced, internal structures roughly perpendicular to the caudal series ( Döderlein, 1929 ), that are said to resemble neural spines and haemal arches ( Marsh, 1882 ). These structures are presumed to have minimised fluttering and prevented buckling in the same way that spars, ribs, stringers, and longerons do in airplane wings and tail-fins, but others have proposed that they were flexible and cartilaginous ( Marsh, 1882 ), especially since their preserved appearance varies. Here, we use laser-simulated fluorescence ( LSF ) imaging of Rhamphorhynchus specimens from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones ( Kaye et al., 2015; Pittman et al., 2021 ) to investigate the vane’s structural properties, explore its usage, its evolutionary origins and the context for its disappearance in later pterodactyloids ( Frey et al., 2003 ). 
 Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch. Four exceptional specimens were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence ( LSF ). Three specimens - NHMUK PV OR 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and ROM VP 55352 - exhibited tail vanes under white light, but the vane of NHMUK PV OR 37003 was only visible under LSF. LSF confirmed the soft tissue extent of the vanes and revealed hidden anatomical details, especially in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ( Figure 2A–C ), where vane areas fluoresced pink and white, indicating soft tissue preservation ( Pittman et al., 2021 ). Tail vanes are sub-symmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 with a length of 700 mm, 750 mm, and 720 mm making up 21%, 22% and 21% of the total tail length of 320 mm, 362 mm, and 348 mm, respectively ( Figure 2 ). NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 have tail vanes occupying a similar proportion of the tail ( 23% and 22% ) as BSP 1907 I 37 ( 74 mm ) and YPM VP 1778 ( 50 mm ). At its widest point, about two-thirds along its length, the vane is 41 mm across in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 but the widest in NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ( 55 mm ), even wider than in BSP 1907 I 37 ( 46 mm ) and almost twice as wide as YPM VP 1778 ( 30 mm ). The vanes of NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and YPM VP 1778 form anterior, lateral and posterior angles of 40°, 45° and 90°; 107°, 113° and 105°; 104°, 100° and 90°; 44°, 107° and 80°, respectively. There is no marked change in caudal morphology within and outside the periphery of the tail vane. The vane encompasses at least 15 caudals in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and at least 17 in NHMUKPOV OR 37787, out of which, 13 appear to bear elongated zygapophyses in 37703 and at least 14 in 37787 ( 16 caudals within YPM VP 1778 and BSP 1907 I 37 ). The vane is extrapolated to originate from the anterior end of a caudal in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1. Under LSF, partial edges of the vane are visible, along with at least 17 relatively straight structures in NHMUK PV OR 37787 ( 10+in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 11+ in NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ) ; projecting vertically, near-perpendicularly to the tail skeleton at the widest point of vane ( based on position of chevron bones e. g. NHM PV OR 37787 ), they can project down to acute angles of 57°, 65°, 66°, and 57° in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and YPM VP 1778, respectively. In NHMUK PV OR 37003 and OR 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1, these vertical structures stem from caudal articulation points in the distal portion of the vane but anteriorly there is no obvious pattern. These data do not support their association with the neural spines and haemal arches ( contra Marsh, 1882 ). In NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1, these vertical structures are relatively thick ( 0. 6–1 mm ) and appear to be hollow, suggesting they were rod-like, and were arranged in parallel ~3–8 mm apart. In NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 they are rarely preserved dead-straight, but are straighter in NMS G. 1994. 13. 1, especially anteriorly. In YPM VP 1778 and BSP 1907 I 37 the vertical structures show more pronounced undulations giving them a sigmoidal morphology. To our knowledge, in NHMUK PV OR 37003 alone, there is a second layer of thinner and more numerous fibres that run across the thick vertical structures, subparallel to the long axis of the tail and become more and more closely spaced as they reach the tail tip. Together, the vertical structures and subhorizontal fibres form a cross-linked lattice. The thick outer margin of the vane is undulated in dorsal view in both NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787, with a trough ~0. 7 mm deep where the thick vertical structures meet the margin and a convex peak roughly mid-way between each pair of vertical structures. A similarly thick outer margin is also observed anteriorly on the tail vane of NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and BSP 1907 I 37. 
 Over 100 Solnhofen pter fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes an ultraviolet.

The study used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) imaging to investigate the structure and function of the tail vanes in early pterosaurs. The vanes were found to be subymmetrical and diamond-shaped, with a length of 700-750 mm, occupying 21-22% of the total tail length. The vanes were supported by a cross-linked lattice of vertical structures, which were relatively thick and hollow, suggesting they were rod-like, and arranged in parallel 3-8 mm apart. These structures were not associated with neuralines and haem arches as previously thought. A second layer of thinner fibres ran across the vertical structures, parallel to the axis of the tail, becoming more closely spaced as they reached the tip, forming a cross-linked lattice. The outer margin of the van was undulated in dorsal view, with a trough 0.7 mm deep where the vertical structures met the margin, and a convex mid-way between each pair of vertical structures.

    Title: 
    Article: Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release. 
 Adolescence is the transitional period between childhood and adulthood characterized by changes in behaviors, such as increases in risk-taking, sensation seeking, and peer-focused sociality ( Spear, 2000; Spear, 2011; Spear, 2013; Nelson et al., 2005 ). These behavioral changes are thought to be evolutionarily advantageous, as they allow for the exploration necessary for a transition to independence ( Spear, 2000 ). However, adolescence is also a time of increased vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders ( SUD ), schizophrenia, and affective disorders, that can persist into adulthood ( Casey et al., 2008; Fareri et al., 2008; Steinberg, 2008 ). Adolescent onset is also associated with increased severity of a range of psychiatric disorders ( Chambers et al., 2003; Kyriakopoulos and Frangou, 2007; Andersen and Teicher, 2008 ). This may be, in part, because the brain is still developing during this vulnerable period and disturbances, such as drug-taking or stress, may disrupt the natural developmental trajectory. Thus, understanding how the adolescent brain develops in a normative state may help us pinpoint how and why this system is perturbed in disease. Reorganization of the dopamine system is hypothesized to underlie many of the changes in adolescent behavior, particularly in reward-related learning and decision-making, and the increased vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders ( Spear, 2000; Spear, 2013; Nelson et al., 2005; Wahlstrom et al., 2010a; Wahlstrom et al., 2010b ). Preclinical research indicates that the dopamine system is going through major changes in adolescence. For example, the density of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum, firing rate of dopamine neurons, and dopamine synthesis all peak during adolescence ( Teicher et al., 1995; Tarazi et al., 1999; Philpot et al., 2009; McCutcheon et al., 2012 ). While reports examining extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum show both lower and higher levels of dopamine during adolescence ( Badanich et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2007; Philpot et al., 2009 ), sub-second stimulated dopamine release is consistently found to be decreased in the striatum of adolescent rats ( Stamford, 1989; Palm and Nylander, 2014; Pitts et al., 2020 ). Our lab has previously shown that the maximum concentration of evoked dopamine release is decreased in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of early adolescent male rats ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), though the mechanism responsible for differentially regulating dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats remains unclear. Since previous research from our lab revealed that the NAc core has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), we focused this report on understanding the mechanisms mediating dopamine release in that region. This is of particular interest because the NAc core is essential for regulating reward-related learning and goal-directed decision- making ( Di Chiara, 2002; Saddoris et al., 2013 ), which are altered during adolescence. Moreover, terminal dopamine release in the striatum does not always correspond with action potentials from ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra projection neurons ( Trulson, 1985; Mohebi et al., 2019 ). Release is also regulated by local circuitry via both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic mechanisms ( see Nolan et al., 2020 ). Functionality of dopamine transporters and release probability ( homosynaptic regulation ) can both mediate stimulated dopamine release ( see Ferris et al., 2013 ). Heterosynaptic mechanisms include neurotransmitter release from local interneurons and projection neurons, such as acetylcholine interneurons, which play a critical role in regulating local terminal dopamine release ( see Cachope and Cheer, 2014; Collins and Saunders, 2020; Nolan et al., 2020 ). For instance, optogenetic stimulation of acetylcholine release drives terminal dopamine release independent of action potential through activation of nAChRs on dopamine terminals ( Threlfell et al., 2012; Cachope et al., 2012 ). This local control over terminal dopamine release has important implications for how dopamine encodes salient information and drives behavior, and one or more of the regulatory mechanisms that mediate terminal dopamine release may change between adolescence and adulthood. Extensive evidence indicates sex differences exist in the dopaminergic system and its local regulation ( Kuhn, 2015; Becker, 2016; Zachry et al., 2021 ). Previously, we have demonstrated that female adolescent rats have significantly higher evoked dopamine release in the NAc core as well as other subregions compared to that of adolescent male rats and adult females ( Pitts et al., 2020 ). Thus, the relationship between adolescent and adult dopamine release is opposite in females, and, therefore, either ( 1 ) the mechanisms explored here will likely not be the same for females as males, or ( 2 ) there is a secondary effect that masks this mechanism in females by altering the relationship we observe at baseline. Since these mechanisms are more than likely sexually dimorphic, we focus here on parsing out the mechanism involved in the changes seen within the adolescent and adult male dopaminergic system. Further research, some of which we are conducting, is needed to understand the relationship between male and female rats. Given the role of local modulators in the dopamine system, variations in heterosynaptic regulation of striatal dopamine release may be responsible for the neurobiological changes seen between adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of local modulators on presynaptic NAc dopamine release of adult and adolescent male rats is the mechanism responsible for driving such developmental changes. Here, we use ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry ( FSCV ) to compare stimulated dopamine release and local circuitry regulation in the NAc core of adult and adolescent male rats. We then use microdialysis to determine the influence of other extrinsic factors in vivo in mediating developmental changes in the dopaminergic system. Enhancing our understanding of the transitional changes in dopamine regulation may shed light on the mechanisms driving changes in reward-related behaviors, and related increase in vulnerability, that are characteristic of adolescence. 
 We first compared the maximum concentration of stimulated dopamine release in the NAc core of adult ( >P70 ) and early adolescent ( P28-35 ) male rats using ex vivo FSCV ( Figure 1A ). Adolescent male rats have significantly lower evoked dopamine release to single-pulse stimulations ( t15=2. 938, p=0. 010 ) ( Figure 1B ) and across a range of stimulation parameters that model tonic- ( 5–10 Hz ) and phasic-like ( 20–100 Hz ) firing of dopamine neurons ( main effect of age: F1, 20=10. 96, p=0. 004 ) ( Figure 1C ). Differences in dynamics at the dopamine terminal can modulate stimulated dopamine release ( see Ferris et al., 2013; Nolan et al., 2020 ). For example, activity of dopamine transporters ( DAT ) have been shown to impact stimulated dopamine levels ( Condon et al., 2019 ). To determine whether differences in DAT activity may mediate the age-related differences in stimulated dopamine release, we examined Vmax in the NAc core. There was no significant difference in Vmax between adult and adolescent male rats ( t18=0. 863, p=0. 399 ) ( Figure 2A ). This suggests that DAT is not the primary mechanism underlying the age-related differences in dopamine release. Next, we examined the role of α nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nACh ) in modulating dopamine release in the NAc. The α-selective blocker αotoxin increased dopamine release in adolescent rats but decreased release in adult rats ( Figure 3A ). This effect was observed across a range of stimulation parameters tonic (5–10 Hz ) and phasic (20–100 Hz ) ( main effect of age: F1,20= 5.96, p= 0.026 ) ( Figure 3B ). This suggests that α nAChRs modulate dopamine release differently in adolescent and adult rats. Since αoto is a selective for α6-containing nAChRs, we hypothesize that α6 nChRs are involved in modulating dopamine release in the NAc. To test this, we examined the effect of α6-selective blocker α-conoto on dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats. αoto increased release in adolescent rats but decreased release in adult ( Figure 4 ). This effect was observed across a range of stimulation tonic (5–10 ) and phasic (20–100 ) ( main effect of age: F,20 5.96 p 0.026 ) ( Figure 4 ). This suggests that α6 nCh are involved in modulating dopamine release in the NAc of adolescent and adult rats. Since αoto is selective for α6 nCh, we hypothesize that α6 nCh are involved in modulating dopamine release in the NAc. To test, we examined the effect of α-selective blocker αoto on dopamine in adolescent and adult rats. αoto increased release in adolescent but decreased adult ( Figure 5 ). This was observed across a range of stimulation tonic (–10 ) and phasic (–100 ) ( main effect age: F,20 5.96 p 0.026 ) ( Figure 5 ). This suggests that α n are involved in modulating dopamine in the NAc of adolescent and adult rats. Since αoto is selective for α n, we hypothesize that n are involved in modulating dopamine in the N. To test, we examined the effect of α-select blocker α on dopamine in adolescent and adult. α increased in adolescent but adult ( Figure 6 ) This was observed a range stimulation (– ) and ph (– ) main age: F20 5. p0 ( Figure 6 ) This suggests that are in modulating in the N of adolescent and adult.

    Title: 
    Article: Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is defined by common behavioral characteristics, raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms. Yet, vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes. Surprisingly, our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11. 2 deletion, have common reductions in neural precursor cell ( NPC ) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets. To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho- ( p ) -proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. 
 Autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication and the presence of repetitive and restrictive interests and behaviors. Though these common impairments define ASD, there is marked heterogeneity in both clinical presentation and etiological underpinnings among affected individuals ( Jones and Klin, 2009; Kim and Lord, 2013, Betancur, 2011 ). In turn, this heterogeneity raises the possibility that there are ‘different’ ASD subtypes ( Ousley and Cermak, 2014; Eaves et al., 1994; Beglinger and Smith, 2001 ). Yet, despite this heterogeneity, all autism subtypes are united by their core behavioral phenotypes. Consequently, we postulate that there may be common pathways linking different autism subtypes. Yet, few studies have compared multiple ASD subtypes to investigate possible commonalities. About 10–15% of autism cases are genetically defined and caused by single gene mutations or copy number variants ( CNVs ) while most of ASD etiology remains undefined or idiopathic. Yet, much of our knowledge of ASD pathophysiology is derived from rodent studies of syndromic rare variant genes. Consequently, our insight into a majority of ASD pathophysiology has been limited and we have little knowledge of the similarities and differences between idiopathic and genetically defined autisms. Several studies have uncovered the convergence of both rare and common variant ASD risk genes onto the developing mid-fetal cerebral cortex ( 8–24 weeks ) ( Willsey et al., 2013; Parikshak et al., 2013; Satterstrom et al., 2020; Grove et al., 2019 ). During this period, neural precursor cells ( NPCs ) undergo proliferation, migration, and differentiation to form neurons and establish normal brain cytoarchitecture ( Liszewska and Jaworski, 2018 ). Now, with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) technology, we can study human neural development in cells derived from individuals with both genetic and idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. iPSC studies of monogenic, CNV, and idiopathic ASD have observed alterations in basic developmental processes, such as synapse formation ( Acab and Muotri, 2015; Yang and Shcheglovitov, 2020 ). However, many of these studies focused on terminally differentiated neurons, with very few examining developmental events that correspond to mid-fetal cortical development that precede synapse formation, such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration ( Packer, 2016, Prem et al., 2020 ). Moreover, there is little insight into whether and how extracellular factors ( EFs ), which coordinate neurodevelopment by regulating signaling, contribute to ASD pathogenesis in human NPCs. To begin addressing these questions, we studied early neurite development and cell migration using human iPSC-derived NPCs from two different autism subtypes – an idiopathic cohort ( I-ASD ) and a genetically defined CNV 16p11. 2 deletion ( 16pDel ) cohort. We demonstrate remarkable convergence in neurite and migration phenotypes despite whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) showing no genetic overlap between the datasets. Specifically, we observed reductions in both neurite outgrowth and migration in NPCs derived from all individuals with ASD. Furthermore, to expand our understanding of NPC response to mid-fetal environmental stimuli, we stimulated NPCs with extracellular factors ( EFs: growth factors, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters ) that are expressed in the mid-fetal period and are known to regulate neurodevelopment. Surprisingly, our EF studies revealed that all unaffected NPCs responded to selected EFs with increases in neurite outgrowth and migration while I-ASD NPCs failed to respond to any of the tested EFs, suggesting the possibility of impaired signaling pathways. Thus, to identify mediating signaling pathways, an unbiased p-proteome analysis was conducted, which showed significant overlap in p-peptides between I-ASD and 16pDel datasets with less overlap in the total proteome. Bioinformatics revealed the mTOR pathway as one of the strongest points of convergence between the two ASD subtypes, which was supported by western analyses. Moreover, modulation of the mTOR pathway with small molecules rescued and reproduced ASD NPC phenotypes indicating that mTOR signaling defects are mechanistically linked to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Nonetheless, there were also ASD subtypes as evidenced by differential responses to EFs between I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs as well as distinct mTOR alterations including elevations and reductions. Overall, our studies indicate that despite the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, two distinct ASD subtypes have dysregulation of mTOR signaling which mediates the surprisingly uniform neurodevelopmental phenotypes. 
 The I-ASD cohort was selected from the previously reported New Jersey Language and Autism Genetics Study. From three separate families, iPSCs were generated from three male probands with ASD and their sex-matched unaffected siblings ( Sib ) served as controls ( see Materials and methods ). For comparison, we selected a genetically defined ASD cohort with 16p11. 2 deletion CNV. The CNV deletes 28 genes, increases autism risk by ~20-fold, and is one of the most common ASD-associated mutations ( Weiss et al., 2008; Niarchou et al., 2019; Qureshi et al., 2014 ). This cohort consists of three individuals, two males ( 16pDel M-1, 16pDel M-2 ) and one female ( 16pDel F ). For sex-matched controls, we selected three iPSC lines from the NIH Regenerative Medicine Program ( NIH ). We analyzed these 12 individuals ( six I-ASD-Sib and six 16pDel-NIH ) extensively for developmental phenotypes utilizing two to five clones per individual ( except for NIH ) and two to five independent neural inductions to ensure extensive rigor and reproducibility ( see Materials and methods and Supplementary file 1 ). WGS was conducted on I-ASD dataset and demonstrated that no individuals harbored the 16p11. 2 deletion ( Supplementary file 2 ). Moreover, no I-ASD individual had rare non-synonymous protein-coding variants in the 28 genes deleted in 16p11. 2. Finally, there are no rare protein-coding non-synonymous genetic variants shared between all three I-ASD individuals. These data are consistent with the two datasets being genetically distinct with no common or shared genetic drivers. During the mid-fetal developmental window, there are a few critical cellular processes that occur and are essential for the normal function and architecture of the brain. These processes include proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Within differentiation, neurite outgrowth is a critical cytoskeleton-dependent process necessary for normal neural connectivity in the brain. Elaboration of neurites is an important mechanism to assess for proper development in neuronal cells and multiple studies of NDDs have reported impairment in neurite outgrowth ( Gleeson and Walsh, 2000; Uppal and Hof, 2013; Wegiel et al., 2010; Kathuria et al., 2018; Doers et al., 2014; Marchetto et al., 2010; Krey et al., 2013; Deshpande et al., 2017; Prem et al., 2020 ). Thus, we first assessed neurite outgrowth in I-ASD NPCs at 48 hr ( Figure 1A and B ). Given the genetic heterogeneity of the I-ASD cohort, we expected to find personalized phenotypes. Yet, surprisingly, we found that all three I-ASD NPCs had a significantly lower percentage of neurites than their respective Sibs ( Figure 1B, 50–60% reduction, p<0. 001 for all families ). To understand how I-ASD NPCs compared to genetically unrelated neurotypical individuals, we also compared I-ASD NPCs to Sibs from other families ( e. g. I-ASD-1 to Sib-2 ). On average, all I-ASD NPCs had reduced neurites compared to all Sib NPCs. Given the common neurite impairment in all I-ASD NPCs, we then extended our studies to another critical cytoskeleton-dependent mid-fetal developmental process, NPC migration ( Figure 1C and D ). We found that all IAS NPCs had reduced migration compared to their Sibs ( Figure 1D, 50–60% reduction, p< 0. 001 for all ). Moreover, IAS NPCs had reduced migration compared to S NPCs from other families ( e. g. IAS-1 to S-2 ). These results indicate that neurite and migration are impaired in all IAS NPCs. To determine whether these phenotypes are specific to IAS or common to other ASD subtypes, we selected a genetically defined cohort with 16p. 2 deletion ( 16Del ) and compared their NPCs to IAS ( Figure 2 A and B ). Surprisingly, we found that 16Del NPCs also had reduced neurite outgrowth and migration compared to their S ( Figure 2, 50–60 reduction, p< 0.001 for all ). Moreover, 16Del NPCs had reduced compared to IAS NPCs ( Figure 2, p< 0.001 for all ). These results indicate that neurite and migration are impaired in both IAS and 16Del NPCs, despite the lack of genetic overlap between the two subtypes. To understand how NPCs respond to mid-fetal stimuli, we stimulated IAS and 16Del NPCs with extracellular factors ( EFs ) known to regulate neurodevelopment ( Figure 3 and 4 ). IAS NPCs failed to respond to all tested EFs while 16Del NPCs responded with increases in neurite out and migration ( Figure 3 and 4, p< 0.001 for all ). These results suggest that IAS have impaired signaling pathways while 16Del have intact. To identify mediating pathways, we conducted an unbiased pte analysis ( Figure 5 ) and found hundreds of shared peptides between IAS and 16Del with less in the total proteome. Bioinformatics revealed the mTOR pathway as one of the strongest points of convergence between the two subtypes which was supported by western. Moreover, modulation of mTOR with small molecules rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs indicating that m signaling is mechanistically linked to neurodevelopmental phenotypes Nonetheless, there were subtypes evidenced by differential responses to EF between IAS and 16Del as well as distinct mTOR alterations including elevations and reductions.

The article discusses research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its subtypes, specifically idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion, using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. The study found that both subtypes have common reductions in neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration, despite no genetic overlap between the datasets. An unbiased phospho-proteome screen identified hundreds of shared peptides, including the mTOR pathway, which was confirmed by western analysis. Modulation of mTOR rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced NPC-associated phenotypes in controls, indicating m signaling is mechanistically linked to neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The study suggests that despite genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, two ASD subtypes have dysregulation m signaling which mediates uniform neurodevelopment phenotypes.

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article in 250-300 words:

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication and repetitive behaviors, with marked heterogeneity in clinical and etiological underpinnings among individuals. Despite this heterogeneity, all subtypes are united by core behavioral phenotypes, suggesting common pathways may link different subtypes. Studies have compared multiple subtypes to investigate commonalities, but few have focused on idiopathic and genetically defined autisms. The study used iPSC technology to study

    Title: 
    Article: Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. 
 Chemical synapses represent diverse and plastic neural contacts that are adapted to the specific needs of neural computation. Synaptic diversity is expressed across the nervous system, within a given circuit and even within the same neuron ( recent reviews in Nusser, 2018; Wichmann and Kuner, 2022 ). Synaptic diversity occurs at various levels: from synapse shape and size, to the ultrastructure of pre- and postsynaptic specializations, to their molecular composition. The auditory system harbors striking examples of synaptic diversity. Glutamatergic ribbon synapses in the cochlea, calyceal synapses in the brainstem, and bouton synapses throughout the central auditory system differ greatly from each other ( Moser et al., 2006; Wichmann and Kuner, 2022 ). Beyond the diversity across synapses formed by different neurons and at different places ( e. g. different regions of the brain or frequency [tonotopic] places of the cochlea; Johnson et al., 2017 ), heterogeneity exists even among auditory synapses formed by an individual presynaptic inner hair cell ( IHC ) with its 5–30 postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs, reviews in Gómez-Casati and Goutman, 2021; Meyer and Moser, 2010; Moser, 2020; Reijntjes and Pyott, 2016 ). Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at different tonotopic positions of the cochlea and is a candidate mechanism for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information ( Grant et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2009; Ohn et al., 2016; Özçete and Moser, 2021 ). For example, the cochlea might use heterogeneous afferent synapses to break down sound intensity information into complementary spike rate codes of SGNs that have been reported along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea for several species ( Huet et al., 2016; Kiang et al., 1965; Sachs and Abbas, 1974; Taberner and Liberman, 2005; Winter et al., 1990 ). Decades of in vivo recordings from single SGNs have demonstrated functional diversity of SGNs with comparable frequency tuning, i. e., receiving input from IHCs at a given tonotopic place or potentially even the same IHC. Such functional diversity is present in both spontaneous and sound-evoked firing. The spontaneous firing rate ( SR ) in the absence of sound varies from less than 1 spikes/s to more than 100 spikes/s ( Barbary, 1991; Evans, 1972; Kiang et al., 1965; Schmiedt, 1989; Taberner and Liberman, 2005 ). In response to increasing sound pressure, SGNs with high SR show a low sound threshold and a steep rise in the spike rate to increasing sound intensities until the rate saturates. SGNs with low SR have a higher sound thresholds, shallower spike rate rise, and saturate at higher sound intensities ( Ohlemiller et al., 1991; Winter et al., 1990 ). Additionally, SGNs show differences in their excitability ( Crozier and Davis, 2014; Markowitz and Kalluri, 2020; Smith et al., 2015 ), morphological features ( Liberman, 1980; Merchan-Perez and Liberman, 1996; Tsuji and Liberman, 1997 ) and heterogeneous molecular profiles ( Li et al., 2020; Petitpré et al., 2020; Petitpré et al., 2018; Shrestha et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018 ). Yet, it has remained challenging to demonstrate a causal link of a candidate mechanism to the physiological SGN diversity. One common approach has been to capitalize on a pioneering study that employed in vivo labeling of physiologically characterized SGNs in cats and proposed that synapses formed by low and high SR SGNs segregate on the basal IHC pole ( Liberman, 1982 ). High SR SGNs preferentially contacted the pillar side of the IHC ( facing pillar cells ), while low SR SGNs synapsed on the opposite, modiolar side of the IHC ( facing the cochlear modiolus ). Interestingly, a segregation has also been found for afferent and efferent synaptic properties, as well as molecular and biophysical SGN properties ( Frank et al., 2009; Grant et al., 2010; Hua et al., 2021; Kantardzhieva et al., 2013; Liberman et al., 2011; Markowitz and Kalluri, 2020; Merchan-Perez and Liberman, 1996; Meyer et al., 2009; Neef et al., 2018; Ohn et al., 2016; Özçete and Moser, 2021; Shrestha et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2014 ). For instance, type Ib and Ic SGNs preferentially synapse on the modiolar side ( Sherrill et al., 2019; Shrestha et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018 ) and show low SR ( Siebald et al., 2023 ). Pillar synapses are preferentially formed by type Ia SGNs ( Shrestha et al., 2018; Siebald et al., 2023 ), have smaller IHC active zones ( AZs ) ( Liberman et al., 2011; Ohn et al., 2016; Reijntjes et al., 2020 ), and activate at voltages as low as the IHC resting potential ( Ohn et al., 2016; Özçete and Moser, 2021 ). The low voltage of activation of release at pillar synapses shown ex vivo could underly the high SR and low sound threshold of firing of SGNs found in vivo but direct demonstration of such a link has been missing. Here, we aimed to bridge the gap between ex vivo presynaptic physiology and in vivo SGN neurophysiology. We performed paired IHC and SGN bouton recordings in acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic in vivo SGN characterization. This approach tightly controls IHC Ca2+ influx and records the postsynaptic SGN response to glutamate release at a single afferent synapse. Using the rate of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( rate of sEPSCs, SR ) as a surrogate for SGN SR, we demonstrate that high SR synapses have larger and more compact sEPSCs as well as lower voltage thresholds, shorter latencies of evoked EPSCs ( eEPSCs ), tighter Ca2+ channel coupling to vesicle release, and higher initial release rates. 90% of these high SR synapses were located on the pillar side of the IHC. Our findings suggest that synaptic heterogeneity accounts for much of the SGN firing diversity at a given tonotopic position. 
 In order to recapitulate synaptic transmission in the absence of sound stimulation, we held the IHC at their presumed physiological resting potential ( –58 mV; Johnson, 2015 ). Since CaV1. 3 Ca2+ channels activate at low voltages ( −65 to –45 mV; Koschak et al., 2001; ; Picher et al., 2017a; Platzer et al., 2000; Xu and Lipscombe, 2001 ), their open probability at the IHC resting potential is thought to be sufficient to trigger vesicle release. In contrast, CaV2.2 channels activate at higher voltages ( –40 to –20 mV; Kosak et al. 2001; Picher et al 2017b; Platzer et al 2000; Xu and Lips 2001 ) and are less likely to open at the resting IHC potential. We found that high SR synapses have more CaV.2 channels and fewer Ca.1 channels than low SR synapses. High SR synapses also had larger and temporally compact EPSCs, lower thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2 channels to vesicle release, shorter latencies and higher initial release rates than low SR synapses. This indicates that heterogeneity in IHC directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. Synaptic heterogeneity is a key feature of neural computation in the auditory system. Synaptic diversity is expressed across the nervous system, within a circuit and even within the same neuron. Synaptic diversity occurs at various levels from synapse and size to ultrastructure of pre and postsynaptic specializations to molecular. The auditory system harbors striking examples of synaptic diversity. Synaptic heterogeneity is a candidate for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at tonotopic positions of the cochlea and is a mechanism for how the cochlea breaks sound information into complementary spike codes of SGNs. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found among synapses formed by individual IHC and SGN. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found in spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGN. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found in SGN with different frequency tuning. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found in SGN with different excitability. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found in S with morphological features. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found in S with molecular profiles.

    Title: 
    Article: The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies. 
 Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Among the five human-infecting species, Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest, with over 619, 000 deaths in 2023 ( WHO, 2023 ). To adapt to extreme environmental challenges, P. falciparum possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors ( TFs ) encoded in the Plasmodium genome ( Coulson et al., 2004; Balaji et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2008; Yuda et al., 2009; Iwanaga et al., 2012; Sinha et al., 2014; Kafsack et al., 2014; Lesage et al., 2018 ). The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 ( ApiAP2 ) DNA-binding proteins are the only well-documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite’s development ( Balaji et al., 2005; Yuda et al., 2009; Iwanaga et al., 2012; Sinha et al., 2014; Kafsack et al., 2014; Yuda et al., 2010; Modrzynska et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2017; Yuda et al., 2020 ). Since the discovery of the AP2 gene family ( Balaji et al., 2005 ), evidence has alluded to their role as master regulators of gene expression throughout transitory phases of the parasite life cycle. The most well-documented are the gametocyte-specific TFs ( AP2-G, AP2-G2 ) ( Sinha et al., 2014; Yuda et al., 2015 ) with the subsequent discovery of those associated with a transition to sexual differentiation ( Yuda et al., 2020 ) as well as sporozoite ( AP2-SP ) and liver stages ( AP2-L ) ( Iwanaga et al., 2012; Yuda et al., 2010 ). The Plasmodium genome, however, encompasses well over 5, 000 protein-coding genes suggesting there are most likely other molecular components responsible for gene expression. It is believed that, to offset the relatively low TF range, Plasmodium has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors, RNA binding proteins, or regulate chromatin structure ( Bozdech et al., 2003b; Le Roch et al., 2003; Bozdech et al., 2003a; Srinivasan et al., 2004; Silvestrini et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2021 ). All together these components work in combination to regulate the dynamic organization of DNA, and the cascade of gene expression required for the parasite life cycle progression ( Dekker et al., 2002; Dostie et al., 2006; Cui et al., 2008; Dixon et al., 2012; Dembélé et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2015; Bunnik et al., 2019; Batugedara et al., 2020 ). Despite their importance, the identification and functional characterization of regulatory players controlling chromatin remains a challenge in this intractable organism. However, with the advent of sensitive technologies capable of capturing important chromatin associated regulatory complexes such as ChIP, chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) technologies, and chromatin enrichment for proteomics ( ChEP ), we can now solve important facets of molecular components controlling epigenetics and chromatin structure. MORC belongs to a highly conserved nuclear protein superfamily with widespread domain architectures that link MORCs with signaling-dependent chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation across plant and animal kingdoms, including the apicomplexan parasites ( Lorković, 2012; Li et al., 2013; Weiser et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2021a ). In all organisms, MORC contains several domains that form a catalytically active ATPase. Apicomplexan MORC ATPases are encircled by Kelch-repeat β-propellers as well as a CW-type zinc finger domain functioning as a histone reader ( Farhat et al., 2020 ). In higher eukaryotes, MORCs were first identified as epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodelers in germ cell development. Currently, these proteins are shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancers and are expected to serve as important biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment ( Wang et al., 2021 ). In the apicomplexan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, TgMORC was shown to recruit the histone deacetylase HDAC3 to particular genome loci to regulate chromatin accessibility, restricting sexual commitment ( Farhat et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2023 ). TgMORC-depleted cells also resulted in change in a gene expression with up regulation of secondary AP2 factors and a significant shift from asexual to sexual differentiation ( Singh et al., 2021a; Farhat et al., 2020; Saksouk et al., 2005; Bougdour et al., 2009; Hillier et al., 2019 ). Having multiple homologs with T. gondii, Plasmodium AP2 protein conservation is primarily restricted to their AP2 DNA-binding domains ( Jeninga et al., 2019; Hiyoshi and Wada, 1990 ). Recently, ChEP experiments done in P. falciparum identified PfMORC as one of the highest enriched chromatin-bound proteins at different stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle ( IDC ) ( Batugedara et al., 2020 ). PfMORC was also detected at a relatively high level throughout the parasite life cycle, including sporozoites and liver stages ( Farhat et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2021b ), and has been identified in several protein pull-down experiments as targeting both AP2 TFs and epigenetic factors ( Singh et al., 2021a; Farhat et al., 2020; Hillier et al., 2019; Subudhi et al., 2023; Bryant et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2024 ). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PfMORC seems to interact with AP2-G2 ( Singh et al., 2021a ), a TF that plays a critical role in the maturation of gametocytes. However, the genome-wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive. In this study, we apply CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC throughout the parasite’s IDC. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validates the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. Using the downregulation of PfMORC induced through the TetR-DOZI system, we demonstrate the functional significance of PfMORC in heterochromatin stability and gene repression. Immunofluorescence-based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that PfMORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at subtelomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation. Hi-C studies indicate that PfOR downregulation impairs histone marks and collapse heterochatin structure leading to parasite death. Together, these findings confirm PfOR plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for antimalarial strategies.

    Title: 
    Article: Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running ). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer. 
 The prevalence of mental health disorders ( e. g. depression, anxiety, suicide ) in cancer patients is significantly greater than in the general population ( Carreira et al., 2018; Pitman et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2013 ). For those patients with no prior psychiatric history, a cancer diagnosis increases the risk of mental health decline ( Zhu et al., 2017 ). The presence of cancer introduces many stressors ( physical, financial, relational ) into the lives of patients, thus a negative impact on mental health may not be surprising. However, these changes persist even in long-term cancer survivors. For instance, decade-long cancer survivors maintain an increased incidence of depression ( approximately 12%, depending on the cancer type ) as compared to the population at large ( 3–5%; Steel et al., 2014; Götze et al., 2020; Kuba et al., 2019 ). While the intensity and prevalence of psychological symptoms in cancer patients fluctuate before, during, and after treatment for a given type of cancer, and between cancer types, it remains higher than in the general population ( Wang et al., 2020; Naser et al., 2021; Tsaras et al., 2018 ). The association of cancer with impaired mental health is directly mediated by the disease, its treatment or both; these findings suggest that the development of a tumor alters brain functions. We have demonstrated the presence of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC; Madeo et al., 2018 ), melanoma ( Balood et al., 2022 ), cervical ( Lucido et al., 2019 ), and ovarian cancers ( Barr et al., 2021 ). Nerve recruitment to the tumor bed is an active process that involves the release of soluble factors, including neurotrophins ( Renz et al., 2018; Hayakawa et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014 ) and neuropeptides ( Kasprzak and Adamek, 2020 ). Tumor-released small extracellular vesicles ( sEVs ) also recruit loco-regional nerves to the tumor bed ( Madeo et al., 2018; Silverman et al., 2021; Amit et al., 2020 ). While these and other studies establish that solid peripheral tumors engage with the peripheral nervous system ( Madeo et al., 2018; Barr et al., 2021; Cole et al., 2015; Magnon et al., 2013; Sadighparvar et al., 2021; Chen and Ayala, 2018 ), it raises the possibility of a direct neuronal connection from the tumor to the brain. A recent study used pseudorabies virus and mapped a connection from tumor-infiltrating nerves in an orthotopic model of murine lung cancer to areas in the brain ( Chen et al., 2022 ). We expand these findings and demonstrate that HNSCC-associated nerves are transcriptionally and functionally altered and project to discrete regions in the brain. The brain neurons connected to the tumor manifest increased activity, which is associated with behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing animals. Consistent with this, newly diagnosed HNSCC patients suffer high rates of depression and anxiety and lower quality of life ( Henry et al., 2022 ). As most cancer patients face cancer-related pain ( Virgen et al., 2022; Hjermstad et al., 2009; van den Beuken-van Everdingen et al., 2007 ), we tested whether treating pain could restore normal behavior. While pain treatment restored normal function at the tumor site, such as nesting behavior, it only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior. Our findings suggest that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior. 
 MOC2-7 cells are HNSCC cancer cells derived from a CXCR3 null mouse on a C57BL/6 background ( Judd et al., 2012 ). Their implantation in male mice results in dense innervation of tumors with nociceptor nerves ( Restaino et al., 2023 ). To define the timing of tumor innervation, C57BL/6 wildtype male mice were orthotopically implanted ( oral cavity ) with MOC2-7 cells, and tumors were collected on days 4-, 10-, and 20- post-implantation. Western blot analysis of whole tumor lysate indicated expression of Tau, a neuronal marker ( Georgieff et al., 1993 ), as early as day four post-tumor implantation, which increased over time ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—source data 1, Figure 1—source data 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). A similar increase in the neuronal marker doublecortin ( DCX ) was noted ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—source data 3, Figure 1—source data 4, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). While DCX is well-known for its expression in immature neurons, it is also expressed in adult peripheral neurons, including dorsal root ganglia ( Dellarole and Grilli, 2008 ), and in non-neuronal tissues ( Bernreuther et al., 2006 ). The DCX signal did not originate from the tumors, as MOC2-7 cell lysate was negative for this protein ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—source data 3, Figure 1—source data 4 ). Consistent with this, immunohistochemical staining of these tumors with the neuronal marker β-III tubulin ( β3T ), demonstrated the increasing presence of nerves beginning on day 4 post-tumor implantation ( Figure 1C–E ). To map the origin of tumor-infiltrating nerves and define the circuits they converge upon, mice with palpable oral MOC2-7 tumors ( approximately day 15 post-tumor implantation ) were intra-tumorally injected with wheat germ agglutinin, WGA, a neural tracer conjugated to a fluorophore ( n=10 mice ). WGA is a lectin molecule that specifically binds to sialic acid residues present ubiquitously on neuronal membranes. It has been used extensively to map neuronal circuits centrally and in the periphery ( Borges and Sidman, 1982; van der Want et al., 1997 ) and is a known transganglionic and transynaptic neuronal tracer ( McNicholas and Michael, 2017; Dumas et al., 1979; Sillitoe, 2016 ) making it ideal for mapping neural circuits ( Tabuchi et al., 2000; Levy et al., 2017; Itaya, 1987; Itaya et al., 1986; Carson and Mesulam, 1982 ). Following tracer injection, tumor growth was permitted for an additional 3–7 days to allow time for tracer labeling to occur. Animals were then euthanized, and tumors, trigeminal ( TGM ) ganglia, and brains were harvested and analyzed by microscopy. Microscopic examination of tumors revealed nerves with robust WGA signals ( Figure 1F ) as well as the V3 branch of the ipsilateral, but not the contralateral, TGM ganglion ( Figure 1G and H ). Consistent with the restricted labeling of tumor-infiltrating nerves, the tracer did not diffuse outside the tumor mass ( Figure 1I ). Examination of brains from MOC2-7 tumor-bearing animals revealed tracer+ neurons in specific regions including spinal nucleus of the trigeminal ( SpVc ), parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ), and central amygdala ( CeA; Figure 1J ). Sections of brain from these regions show the presence of tracer-positive neurons ( Figure 1K ). Tracer injections of equivalent volume and concentration into the oral cavities of control non-tumor-bearing animals did not label the TGM ganglia nor areas in the brain ( data not shown ). A larger volume of WGA was injected into the oral cavity of non-tumor-bearing mice did not label the TGM nor brain regions ( data not shown ). These results indicate that tumor-infiltrating nerves project to distinct areas of the brain, including the Spc, PBN, and Ce. To determine if these neurons are functionally connected to the tumor, we used electrophysiology to record the activity of neurons in the Spc, P, and Ce of M2-7 tumor-bearing and non-tumor-bearing mice. Extracellular recordings were made in the Spc, P, and Ce of M2-7 tumor-bearing and non-tumor mice ( n= 4–5 mice per group ) using a multielectrode array ( Figure 2A ). Recordings were made in the Sp, P, and Ce of M2-7 tumor-bearing and non-tumor mice ( n= 4–5 mice per group ) using a multielectrode array ( Figure 2 ) Recordings were made in the Sp, P, and Ce of M2 tumor-bearing and non-tumor mice n=4–5 per group using multielectde array ( Figure 2 ) Recordings were made in the Sp, P, Ce of M-7 tumor and non-tumor mice n=4–5 per group using multielectde ( Figure 2 ) Recordings were made the Sp, P, Ce M- tumor and nonumor n=5 per group multielect ( Figure 2 ) Recordings were made the Sp, P Ce M- tumor and non-tumor n=5 per multielect ( Figure 2 Recordings were the, P Ce M- tumor and non-t n=5 multielect Figure 2 Recordings the, Ce M tumor non-t=5 multie Figure 2 Record the, M non-tumor=5 multie Figure 2 the non-tumor=5 multie Figure 2-tumor=5 multie Figure 2-tumor=5 mult Figure 2-tumor5 multie Figure 2-tumor5 multie Figure 2-t5 multie Figure 2-5 mult Figure 2-5ie Figure 2-5ie Figure 2-5ie 2 Figure-5ie 2-5ie 2-5ie 2-5 2ie 5 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

    Title: 
    Article: Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs. 
 A salient characteristic of RNA viruses is their high error rate in transcription and their resulting quasispecies nature ( Eigen, 1996; Domingo and Holland, 1997 ). This diversity is also reflected in the ensemble of consensus sequences sampled across the infected host population, as is apparent in the GISAID ( Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ) repository of SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017 ). With currently ≈15 million entries, this unprecedented large database has provided the basis for phylogenetic analyses that have identified critical amino acid mutations associated with immune evasion, infectivity, and disease severity, and allowed the rapid identification of variants of concern ( Greaney et al., 2022; Kepler et al., 2021; Obermeyer et al., 2022; Rochman et al., 2021; Viana et al., 2022 ). The vast majority of mutations, however, seem inconsequential in that they usually do not lead to any fixed substitutions. Nonetheless, the mutant spectrum exhaustively describes a landscape of amino acids that may occupy any position in the viral proteins, as in a natural deep mutational scan ( Bloom and Neher, 2023; Schuck and Zhao, 2023; Zhao et al., 2022 ). Biophysical constraints implicit in the shape of such landscapes are key to understand the function and molecular evolution of viral proteins ( Starr and Thornton, 2016; Wang et al., 2021 ). Unfortunately, the wealth of genomic information on SARS-CoV-2 stands in stark contrast with our knowledge of the phenotypic consequences of sequence mutations. In conjunction with biophysical and structural studies, inspections of local mutations have increased our understanding of mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry, mechanisms of replication and assembly, and interaction with various host factors ( Dadonaite et al., 2023; Del Veliz et al., 2021; Greaney et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023; Stevens et al., 2022; Syed et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, the range of naturally occurring mutations at target sites is an important consideration for potential drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics ( Artesi et al., 2020; Saldivar-Espinoza et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022 ). Outside these focused studies of relatively well-understood hot spots, however, the mutational landscape has remained relatively unexplored. Biophysical fitness landscapes have been studied with regard to observables such as thermal stability of globular proteins, solvent accessibility, catalytic activity, or binding affinity of protein-protein interfaces, which has led to significant advances in understanding relationship between molecular properties, population fitness, and evolutionary processes ( Bershtein et al., 2017; Bloom et al., 2006; Echave and Wilke, 2017; Lässig et al., 2017; Liberles et al., 2012; Serohijos and Shakhnovich, 2014; Sikosek and Chan, 2014; Wang et al., 2015 ). However, it was found that constraints for evolution of intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) are much different from those of globular proteins ( Brown et al., 2010; Lafforgue et al., 2022 ). Generally, intrinsic disorder and loose packing is a common characteristic of many RNA virus proteins ( Tokuriki et al., 2009 ), which is thought to promote functional promiscuity, permit greater diversity, and enhance evolvability to adopt new functions with few mutations ( Charon et al., 2018; Gitlin et al., 2014; Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009 ). One possible mechanism is viral mimicry of host-protein short linear motifs ( SLiMs ) that allow binding to host protein domains and cause subversion of host cellular pathways ( Davey et al., 2015; Davey et al., 2011; Hagai et al., 2014; Kruse et al., 2021; Mihalič et al., 2023; Schuck and Zhao, 2023; Shuler and Hagai, 2022 ). It was also shown how nonlocal biophysical properties, such as the charge of IDRs, can be relevant evolutionary traits ( Zarin et al., 2021; Zarin et al., 2017 ). More recently, it was recognized that the formation of membrane-less cellular compartments driven by liquid-liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) is a key aspect of many intrinsically disordered proteins, including many viral proteins ( Cascarina and Ross, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023 ). What kind of sequence constraints may derive from the biophysical requirement to conserve LLPS properties is currently only emerging ( Brown et al., 2011; Chin et al., 2022; Ho and Huang, 2022; Lin et al., 2017; Riback et al., 2017 ). The goal of the present work is to probe the phenotypic diversity with respect to several biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid ( N- ) protein, taking advantage of the vast mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2. N-protein is the most abundant viral protein in the infected cell ( Finkel et al., 2021 ), and as we reported previously ( Zhao et al., 2022 ), it is also the most diverse structural protein with approximately 86% of its 419 residues capable of assuming on average four to five different amino acids evidently without impairment of viability. The highest frequency of mutations occurs in the substantial IDRs which are the N-arm, linker, and C-arm that flank and connect the folded nucleic acid binding domain ( NTD ) and the dimerization domain ( CTD ) ( Figure 1 ). The IDRs comprise approximately half of the molecule and allow large conformational fluctuations ( Botova et al., 2024; Cubuk et al., 2021; Redzic et al., 2021 ). The eponymous structural function of N-protein is that of scaffolding genomic RNA for virion assembly. It proceeds via nucleic acid ( NA ) binding-induced conformational changes and oligomerization, leading to the formation of ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) particles with as-of-yet unknown molecular architecture, ≈38 of which are arranged like beads-on-a-string in the viral particle ( Carlson et al., 2022; Cubuk et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2021 ), and are anchored through binding of N-protein to viral M-protein ( Lu et al., 2021; Masters, 2019 ). Beyond this structural role, N-protein is highly multifunctional and binds to multiple host proteins to modulate or exploit different pathways, including stress granules ( Biswal et al., 2022; Gordon et al., 2020; Savastano et al., 2020 ), the type 1 interferon signaling pathway ( Chen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020 ), the NLRP3 inflammasome ( Pan et al., 2021 ), and others, as recently reviewed ( Wu et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023 ). N-protein can form macromolecular condensates through LLPS that aid in assembly functions and interactions with host proteins ( Carlson et al., 2020; Cascarina and Ross, 2022; Cubuk et al., 2021; Iserman et al,202; et al. 202; et al. 202; et al. 202; et al.202; et al.202; et al.202; et.202; et al.202; et.202; et.202; et.202; et.202;202; et.202;202; et.202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202;202

    Title: 
    Article: Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis. 
 Hibernation is an adaptive strategy employed by many animals aiming to decrease their metabolic rate and improve survival, particularly during harsh, winter conditions where food supply is limited, and thermogenic demands are high ( Geiser, 2013 ). During hibernation, mammals typically undergo a decrease in body temperature, heart, and breathing rates ( Jani et al., 2013; Milsom and Jackson, 2024; Sprenger and Milsom, 2022 ). In so-called fat-storing hibernators, this is inherently accompanied by prolonged fasting and fatty acids become the main substrate for energy provision ( Florant, 1998; Giroud et al., 2020 ). Besides these common features associated with overall metabolic depression, there are also significant inter-species differences in the underlying strategies. For instance, small ( <8 kg ) fat-storing hibernating mammals such as 13-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) or garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ) experience extended bouts of a hypo-metabolic state ( torpor ), punctuated by spontaneous periods of interbout euthermic arousals ( IBA ), during which metabolic activity transiently increases back to basal levels. During torpor, metabolic rate decreases below 5% of euthermic values and core body temperatures decrease from 35°C–38°C to 4°C–8°C ( Sprenger et al., 2018; Haugg et al., 2024 ). In contrast, either medium ( 10–20 kg, e. g. European badger, Meles meles ) or large ( >20 kg, e. g. Eurasian brown bear, Ursus arctos, and American black bear, Ursus americanus ) hibernating mammals exhibit a pronounced hypo-metabolic state ( as low as 25% of their basal metabolic rate in the case of bears ), but only experience a mild decline in body temperature ( to 32–35°C depending on body size ) that lasts for several winter months ( Geiser, 2013; Tøien et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2023 ). While species-specific physiological patterns are well-documented, the molecular and cellular mechanisms operative in individual organs to achieve these remain largely undefined. Skeletal muscle constitutes approximately 45–55% of body mass and serves as a major determinant of basal metabolic rate and heat production ( Zurlo et al., 1990; Sylow et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have uncovered some specific metabolic changes in skeletal muscle during hibernation ( Giroud et al., 2020 ). For example, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, as well as a suppression of ATP production capacity, has previously been documented in skeletal muscles from I. tridecemlineatus during torpor ( James et al., 2013 ). Previous work has demonstrated that ground squirrels require an optimal dietary ratio of monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fats, approximately 2:1, during their fat-storing period to facilitate effective hibernation ( Frank and Storey, 1995 ). The proteome of I. tridecemlineatus has then been shown to be enriched for fatty acid β-oxidation during periods of torpor. However, some reliance upon carbohydrate metabolism is maintained. The activity of phosphoglucomutase ( PGM1 ) is even increased during torpor ( Hindle et al., 2011 ). In U. arctos, skeletal muscle exhibits a transition from carbohydrate utilization to lipid metabolism, coupled with a reduction in whole-tissue ATP turnover ( Chazarin et al., 2019 ). Muscle is organized into an array of fibers containing repeating sarcomeres, which are crucial for regulating not only contraction but also metabolism and thermogenesis ( Gordon et al., 2000 ). Until recently, energy consumption in skeletal muscle was thought to be primarily linked to the activity of myosin during muscular contraction ( Gordon et al., 2000 ). Additionally, thermogenesis in skeletal muscle was previously attributed primarily to the electron transport system, in some cases link to uncoupling of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase ( SERCA ) ( Periasamy et al., 2017; González-Alonso et al., 2000 ). However, growing evidence that the sarcomeric metabolic rate and thermogenesis are also controlled by ‘relaxed’ myosin molecules is emerging ( McNamara et al., 2015 ). Myosin heads in passive muscle ( pCa >8 ), can be in different resting metabolic states that maintain a basal level of ATP consumption. In the ‘disordered-relaxed’ ( DRX ) state, myosin heads are generally not bound to actin and structurally exist in a conformation ( so-called ON state ) where they primarily exist freely within the interfilamentous space in the sarcomere ( Stewart et al., 2010; Grinzato et al., 2023 ). In the ‘super-relaxed’ ( SRX ) state, myosin heads adopt a structural conformation against the thick filament backbone ( so-called OFF state; Hooijman et al., 2011 ). This conformation sterically inhibits the ATPase site on the myosin head, significantly reducing both ATP turnover in these molecules and, therefore heat production. The SRX state has an ATP turnover rate five to ten times lower than that of myosin heads in the DRX state ( Cooke, 2011 ). A 20% shift of myosin heads from SRX to DRX is predicted to increase whole-body energy expenditure by 16% and double skeletal muscle thermogenesis ( Cooke, 2011 ). What remains to be determined is whether, across mammals, increasing the proportions of myosin in the DRX or SRX states serves as a physiological molecular mechanism to fine-tune metabolic demands and thermogenesis. This includes potential contributions to whole-body metabolic depression observed during hibernation. Hence, in the present study, we hypothesized that a remodeling of the proportions of myosin DRX and SRX conformations within skeletal muscles occurs and is a major suppressor of ATP/metabolic demand during hibernation. A recent study on I. tridecemlineatus cardiac muscle supports this hypothesis, finding higher proportions of SRX during torpor ( Toepfer et al., 2020 ). We examined isolated skeletal myofibers extracted from both small and large hibernating mammals - I. tridecemlineatus, E. quercinus, U. arctos, and U. americanus. We employed a multifaceted approach: loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments to assess myosin conformation and ATP turnover time, X-ray diffraction for sarcomere structure evaluation, and proteomic analyses to quantify differential PTMs. 
 To investigate whether resting myosin DRX and SRX states and their respective ATP consumption rates were altered during hibernation, we utilized the loaded Mant-ATP chase assay in isolated permeabilized muscle fibers from U. arctos obtained during either summer ( active period ) or winter ( hibernating period ). A total of 104 myofibers were tested at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ). A representative decay of the Mant-ATP fluorescence in single muscle fibers is shown, indicating ATP consumption by myosin heads ( Figure 1A ). We found that during hibernation, myos heads in U. aros were predominantly in the SRX conformation ( Figure 1B ) and exhibited lower ATP consumption ( Figure 1C ) compared to active periods. In contrast, I. trcematus and E. quinus myos heads were predominantly in the DRX conformation ( Figure 1 ) and exhibited higher ATP consumption ( Figure 1 ) during hibernation compared to active periods. These results suggest that during hibernation, my heads in U arct and Uus are in the SR conformation and consume less ATP, whereas in I trcem and E quinus are in the DR con and consume more ATP. Next, we tested the effect of cold exposure on myin conformation and ATP consumption in I trcem and Einus during hibern. Loaded-ATP experiments were performed at 8 °C, near the body temperature of torpid animals. We found that my heads in I trcem and Einus were predominantly in the SR con at 8 °C ( Figure 2 ) and exhibited lower ATP consumption ( Figure 2 ) compared to 20 °C ( Figure 1 ) during hibern. This indicates that my heads in I tr and E are in the SR con and consume less ATP at 8 °C compared to 20 °C. Furthermore, we observed hyperphosphorylation of myin in I tr during hibern at 8 °C ( Figure 3 ), which was predicted to stabilize the myin molecule. This may act as a molecular mechanism mitigating myin-associated increases in skeletal energy expenditure during tor in response to cold exposure. To further investigate the role of PTMs on myin during hibern, we performed proteomic analyses on myofibers from U arct and Uus during hibern and active periods. Phosphorylation of myin was observed in U ar during hibern ( Figure 4 ) but not in Uus ( Figure 4 ). Phosphorylation of myin in U during hibern was predicted to stabilize the myin and reduce ATP consumption. In contrast, dephosphorylation of my was observed in Uus during hibern ( Figure 4 ) but not U ( Figure 4 ). Deosphorylation of my in U during hibern was predicted to increase ATP consumption. Overall, our results demonstrate that myin is altered in hibern mammals, contributing to changes in ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold and highlight myin as a contributor to skeletal thermogenesis.

    Title: 
    Article: Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development. 
 Cellular organization plays a major role in tissue and organ morphogenesis ( Lecuit and Le Goff, 2007; Lecuit and Lenne, 2007; Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994; Bailles et al., 2022; Collinet and Lecuit, 2021; Sutherland et al., 2020 ). The mammalian growth plate is an excellent example for this concept as its complex architecture is the engine driving longitudinal bone growth ( Rubin et al., 2021; Breur et al., 1991; Wilsman et al., 2008; Wilsman et al., 1996; Cooper et al., 2013 ). The growth plate, which is located at both ends of developing long bones, drives bone elongation by a tightly regulated process of cell proliferation and differentiation, which involves increase in cell size and their organization along the proximal-distal ( P-D ) axis ( Kronenberg, 2003; Mackie et al., 2008; Cancedda and Cancedda, 1995; Noonan et al., 1998 ). The growth plate comprises four zones. At the most distal epiphyseal end is the resting zone ( RZ ), where chondrocytes are small and disorganized. Underneath lies the proliferative zone ( PZ ), where chondrocytes increase in volume, adopt a flat and elongated morphology, and organize into columns ( Abad et al., 2002; Dodds, 1930; Li and Dudley, 2009; Li et al., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014 ). In the subsequent prehypertrophic ( PHZ ) and hypertrophic zones ( HZ ), cells reach their maximum size ( Rubin et al., 2021; Cooper et al., 2013; Breur et al., 1997 ). These changes in cell size and spatial organization determine the rate of bone elongation ( Breur et al., 1991; Wilsman et al., 2008; Wilsman et al., 1996; Kember and Walker, 1971; Lui et al., 2018; Li et al., 2015 ). Columnar arrangement of chondrocytes has been a subject of study for nearly a century ( Dodds, 1930 ), gaining attention due to the remarkable emergence of cellular order from the highly disordered RZ. This columnar arrangement facilitates bone elongation by maximizing cell density in the longitudinal axis while limiting it laterally, thereby constraining hypertrophic cell growth to the P-D axis ( Romereim and Dudley, 2011 ). In the PZ, the division of column-forming cells is perpendicular to the P-D axis. Considering that these cells ultimately orient themselves with their short axis parallel to the P-D axis, the rearrangement into elongated columns requires a robust morphogenetic mechanism. Originally, analyses of two-dimensional static images suggested that in the embryonic growth plate, columns form through a process akin to convergent extension, an evolutionarily conserved tissue elongation mechanism involving cell intercalation ( Li and Dudley, 2009; Ahrens et al., 2009; Shwartz et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2003 ). However, more recent live imaging studies in various model systems showed that cells do not intercalate to form columns ( Li et al., 2017; Romereim and Dudley, 2011; Yuan et al., 2023 ). Instead, following cell division, sister cells undergo a cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion-dependent 90° rotation prior to separation. This rotation ensures that cells are neatly stacked with their short axis parallel to the P-D axis. Recent studies have highlighted three fundamental principles governing column formation. First, columns consist of clonal cells ( Li and Dudley, 2009; Li et al., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014; Ahrens et al., 2009; Newton et al., 2019; Mizuhashi et al., 2018; Hallett et al., 2022 ). Whereas embryonic columns are multiclonal, postnatally, following the formation of secondary ossification centers, columns become monoclonal and originate from Pthrp + RZ cells ( Newton et al., 2019; Mizuhashi et al., 2018; Hallett et al., 2022 ). The second principle is that cells within the column orient their short axis parallel to the P-D axis of the bone ( Rubin et al., 2021; Li and Dudley, 2009; Li et al., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014; Ahrens et al., 2009; Shwartz et al., 2012; Aszodi et al., 2003 ) within a threshold of 12° ( Li et al., 2017 ). The third rule pertains to the alignment of the column itself. The long axis is oriented parallel to the P-D axis ( Dodds, 1930; Li and Dudley, 2009; Romereim et al., 2014; Ahrens et al., 2009; Shwartz et al., 2012; Aszodi et al., 2003; Moss-Salentijn et al., 1987 ) within a 12° threshold for single columns and a 20° threshold for complex columns ( Li et al., 2017 ). Over the years, numerous studies have been dedicated to deciphering the molecular and cellular processes underpinning the formation of columns and their involvement in bone elongation. Studies in embryonic and postnatal mouse limbs have shown the importance of interactions between chondrocytes and the surrounding ECM. These studies have identified beta 1 and alpha 10 integrins, along with α-parvin, as physical regulators governing cell polarity and rotation during column formation ( Yuan et al., 2023; Aszodi et al., 2003; Bengtsson et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, studies in embryonic chick and mouse limbs have shown that cell surface signaling through the Fz/Vangl/PCP pathway plays a major role in regulating chondrocyte polarity and rearrangement ( Li and Dudley, 2009; Li et al., 2017; Ahrens et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2003; Yang and Mlodzik, 2015 ) and that GDF5 is involved in chondrocyte orientation ( Rubin et al., 2021 ). Finally, studies in paralyzed mice ( Killion et al., 2017 ) and muscle-less mouse embryos Shwartz et al., 2012; Pierantoni et al., 2021 have uncovered the important role of muscle load in regulating cell polarity and column formation. In this study, we analyze the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plate of mice. Intriguingly, we found that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that, in turn, give rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. However, in the postnatal growth plate clones, the rate of complete cell rotations increases, leading to the formation of complex columns through a combination of stereotypical and non-stereotypic cell stacking, as well as of small, orthogonally oriented clusters. Additionally, we observed that column formation is buffered, permitting deviations of 12° and 20 from the P axis. Our findings support the idea that modulations of the division plane of proliferating chrocy determines the formation of either columns or clusters, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal growth. Overall, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth activity and elongation during bone development. 

Here is a clear, accurate, and formal summary of the article:

**Title:** The Role of Chondrocy Columns in Bone Elongation: A New Insights from 3D Imaging and Morphometric Analysis

**Abstract:**

Chondrocy columns, a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a crucial role in bone elongation. In this study, we analyzed hundreds of confetti-labeled clones in embryonic and postnatal mouse growth plates using 3D imaging and morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, we found that embryonic chrotes are not arranged in typical columns, but rather in elongated clusters perpendicular to the growth direction. Postnatally, we observed complex columns composed of ordered and disordered stacks and small, disorganized clusters at the edges. Our findings suggest that modulations of division plane of proliferating chro determines formation of either columns or clusters, a multifunctional design regulating morphogenesis throughout pre and post growth.

**Introduction:**

The mammalian growth plate is an excellent example of cellular organization and morphogenesis, driving longitudinal bone elongation. The plate comprises four zones: resting, proliferative, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic. Chondcy in the prolifer zone increase in size, adopt flat morphology, and organize into columns. Columnar arrangement facilitates elongation by maximizing cell density in the longitudinal axis while limiting laterally.

**Methods:**

We analyzed 3D conf-labeled clones in embryonic and post mouse growth plates using imaging and morphometric analysis.

**Results:**

* Embryonic chro are not arranged in typical columns, but in elongated perpendicular to growth
* Postnatally, complex columns composed of ordered and dis stacks and small, dis clusters at edges
* Modulation of division plane proliferating chro determines formation of columns or clusters

**Discussion:**

Our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane of proliferating chro determines formation of either columns or clusters, a multifunction design regulating morphogenesis throughout pre and post growth. This work provides new understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying growth activity and elong during development.

**Conclusion:**

Chro columns play a crucial role in bone elongation. Our study highlights the importance of modulations of division plane proliferating chro in determining formation of columns or clusters, a multif design regulating morphogenesis throughout pre and post growth.

    Title: 
    Article: Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability. 
 Cells require an external lipid membrane to separate their internal cytoplasm from the environment. Since the membrane permeability of common solutes spans ten orders of magnitude, some molecules diffuse readily across the membrane, while the translocation of others requires facilitation by carriers ( Stillwell, 2016; Pizzagalli et al., 2021 ). Understanding the processes by which small molecules cross membranes is of key pharmacological interest owing to their role in drug delivery, which may be mediated by passive diffusion, protein carriers, or a combination of both ( Sugano et al., 2010 ). The solute-carrier ( SLC ) superfamily encompasses 65 families of more than 450 genes, with substrates ranging in size from simple ions to complex macromolecules used in metabolism and signalling ( Pizzagalli et al., 2021 ). Within this superfamily, the SLC15 family includes POTs that have significant homology through all domains of life and are evolutionarily ancient ( Daniel et al., 2006 ). Of the four mammalian family members, PepT1 ( SLC15A1 ), and PepT2 ( SLC15A2 ) are the most well studied. The former is predominantly expressed in the small intestine and characterised as a low-aﬃnity, high-capacity transporter ( Fei et al., 1994 ). The latter has a broader expression pattern including the kidneys, lungs, and brain and is described as high-aﬃnity, low-capacity ( Kottra and Daniel, 2004 ). As secondary-active transporters, they couple uphill substrate translocation to the symport of protons down their electrochemical gradient ( Fei et al., 1994; Rubio-Aliaga et al., 2000 ). The peptide–proton stoichiometry is not conserved between different substrates and POT family members ( Parker et al., 2014 ). For PepT1, stoichiometries of 1:1 and 2:1 have been reported for neutral/basic and acidic di-peptides, respectively ( Fei et al., 1994; Steel et al., 1997 ). For PepT2, a 2:1 stoichiometry was reported for the neutral di-peptide D-Phe-L-Ala and 3:1 for anionic D-Phe-L-Glu ( Chen et al., 1999 ). Alternatively, Fei et al., 1999 have found 1:1 stoichiometries for either of D-Phe-L-Gln ( neutral ), D-Phe-L-Glu ( anionic ), and D-Phe-L-Lys ( cationic ). Here, we work under the assumption of a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides, motivated also by our computational results that indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism. POT family transporters belong to the major facilitator superfamily ( MFS ) and share a conserved topology of two six-helix bundles that form the functional transport domain, their N-and C-termini facing the cytoplasm. ( Newstead et al., 2011 ). They operate via an alternating access mechanism encoded in four inverted topology repeats, progressively reorienting the N-and C-terminal bundles to cycle through outwards-facing ( OF ), occluded ( OCC ), and inwards-facing ( IF ) states ( Radestock and Forrest, 2011 ). Since the first structure of a POT family member was published ( Newstead et al., 2011 ), many procaryotic ( Solcan et al., 2012; Guettou et al., 2013; Doki et al., 2013; Lyons et al., 2014; Guettou et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014; Fowler et al., 2015; Boggavarapu et al., 2015; Beale et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2017; Martinez Molledo et al., 2018; Ural-Blimke et al., 2019; Minhas and Newstead, 2019; Stauffer et al., 2022; Kotov et al., 2023 ) and plant ( Parker and Newstead, 2014; Sun et al., 2014 ) homologues have been structurally and biochemically characterised, all in IF states with varying degrees of occlusion ( see Figure 1a for an overview of available POT structures and their conformational states ). Several residues have been suggested to be involved in proton transfer, including a partially conserved histidine on TM2 ( H87; residue numbers refer to PepT2, if not specified otherwise ) ( Terada et al., 1996; Fei et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2000; Omori et al., 2021; Parker et al., 2021 ) and two conserved glutamates on TM1 ( E53 and E56 ) ( Jensen et al., 2012; Doki et al., 2013; Aduri et al., 2015 ), while simulations have helped our understanding of proton-transfer processes and conformational changes ( Parker et al., 2017; Selvam et al., 2018; Batista et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022 ). However, the details of the molecular mechanism of alternating access in POTs, particularly regarding the coupling of conformational changes, substrate binding, and proton movement to each other, remain unclear. Cryo-EM and Alphafold 2 have recently provided views of mammalian POTs in conformations spanning from OF via inward-facing-partially occluded to fully-open IF ( Parker et al., 2021; Killer et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022; Jumper et al., 2021 ). From these structures emerges a picture where the intracellular gate is constituted by broad close-packing of hydrophobic residues on TM 4, 5, 10, and 11, with possible stabilisation from the conserved D170–K642 salt-bridge. The extracellular gate appears to be spread along the cleft between the N-and C-terminal bundles, with contributions from the H87 ( TM 2 ) – S321 ( TM 7 ) polar interaction network as well as the R206 ( TM 5 ) – D342 ( TM 8 ) and K64 ( TM 1 ) – D317 ( TM 7 ) salt bridges ( Figure 1b ). This is intriguing, because the mammalian H87 residue is only conserved in some prokaryotic homologues, and R206–D342 just among mammalian POTs. We speculate based on this feature that the extracellular gating mechanism could be less conserved than POT alternating access in general. As for the intracellular gating mechanism, an involvement of the D170–K642 salt bridge has been suggested, and the OF structure shows close-packing of several hydrophobic residues ( F184, Y183, F187, L630, and Y634 ) that constrict access to the binding site from the intracellular side ( Figure 1c; Parker et al., 2021 ). It is not known thus far how the opening of the intracellular gate ( i. e. the OCC→IF transition ) is triggered, and how it is coupled to proton movement and the presence of substrate. POTs accommodate their substrates in a highly conserved binding pocket, interfacing between an acidic patch on the C-terminal bundle and a hydrophobic patch on the N-terminal bundle ( Figure 1d ). The binding site is characterised by a conserved aromatic residues ( F, W, Y, F ) and hydrophobic ( L, I, V ) residues, with the latter forming a hydrophobic cage around the substrate ( Figure 1e ). The binding pocket has been shown to accommodate di- and tri-peptides ( Fe et al, 199; Chen et al, 199 ), but the mechanism of substrate recognition remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to investigate the conformational cycle of PepT and its thermodynamic driving forces in the absence and presence of substrate. We use enhanced-sampling to map the full conformational space of PepT and identify a sequence of protonation steps that drive inward-directed access. Our simulations reveal differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and prokary POTs, which we validate in cell-based transport assays. We also use constant-P MD and absolute free energy ( ABFE ) calculations to establish a mechanistic link between proton and peptide binding, revealing details of secondary active transport in POTs. Our results provide a step forward understanding of proton-coupled peptide transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier biology with drug design to target and bioavailability.

    Title: 
    Article: Across the animal kingdom, neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization, and humans are no exception. A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates, however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive. To address this issue, we obtained intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across superior temporal gyrus ( STG ). Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. Indeed, overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring. Further, we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity. 
 A major question in neuroscience is how do animals distinguish between stimuli originating from the environment and those produced by their own actions. Sensorimotor circuits share a common mechanism across the animal kingdom in which sensory responses to self-generated motor actions are suppressed. It is commonly hypothesized that suppressing responses to predicted self-generated stimuli increases sensitivity of the sensory system to external stimuli ( Poulet and Hedwig, 2002; Poulet and Hedwig, 2006; Crapse and Sommer, 2008; Schneider and Mooney, 2018 ). Furthermore, it enables detection and correction of motor errors by providing a template of the predicted sensory outcome to compare with the actual sensory outcome. In the domain of speech, this mechanism is described in models which suggest that neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during speech production. When there is a mismatch between the predicted auditory outcome and the actual auditory feedback, responses in the auditory regions are enhanced to encode the mismatch and inform vocal-motor regions to correct vocalization ( Hickok et al., 2011; Houde and Nagarajan, 2011; Tourville and Guenther, 2011 ). A common experimental strategy to generate mismatch between the predicted auditory outcome and the actual auditory feedback is to perturb auditory feedback during speech production. Auditory feedback perturbations are usually applied either by delaying auditory feedback ( DAF ), which disrupts speech fluency ( Lee, 1950; Fairbanks, 1955; Stuart et al., 2002 ), or by shifting voice pitch and formants, which result in compensatory vocal changes in the opposite direction of the shift ( Houde and Jordan, 1998; Jones and Munhall, 2000; Niziolek and Guenther, 2013 ). Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies investigated neural responses during speech production both in the absence and presence of auditory feedback perturbations. In support of speech production models, these studies have repeatedly reported suppressed responses in auditory cortex during speaking compared with passive listening to speech ( Numminen et al., 1999; Wise et al., 1999; Curio et al., 2000, Houde et al., 2002; Christoffels et al., 2007, Ford et al., 2010, Niziolek et al., 2013 ), as well as enhanced responses when auditory feedback was perturbed indicating sensitivity to auditory feedback ( Tourville et al., 2008; Behroozmand et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2013; Greenlee et al., 2013, Kort et al., 2014; Behroozmand et al., 2015; Ozker et al., 2022 ). However, it is not clear whether the same or distinct neural populations in the auditory cortex show speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. While auditory responses are largely suppressed during speech production, detailed investigations using neurosurgical recordings revealed that the degree of suppression was variable across cortical sites, and auditory cortex also exhibited non-suppressed and enhanced responses ( albeit less common ) ( Creutzfeldt and Ojemann, 1989; Flinker et al., 2010; Greenlee et al., 2011 ), mirroring results from non-human primate studies using single-unit recordings ( Eliades and Wang, 2003; Eliades and Wang, 2008 ). In the same non-human primate study, it was reported that neurons that were suppressed during vocalization showed increased activity when auditory feedback was perturbed ( Eliades and Wang, 2008 ). Based on this finding, we predicted that if speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of speech errors, suppressed auditory sites should be sensitive to auditory feedback, thus exhibit enhanced neural responses to feedback perturbations. Alternatively, if suppression and speech monitoring are unrelated processes, then suppressed sites should be distinct from the ones that are sensitive to auditory feedback. The level of attention during speech monitoring can vary depending on the speech task. During normal speech production, speech monitoring does not require a conscious effort, however it is a controlled, attentional process during an auditory feedback perturbation task ( Hashimoto and Sakai, 2003 ). It is well known that selective attention enhances auditory responses and improves speech perception under noisy listening conditions or when multiple speech streams are present ( Mesgarani and Chang, 2012, Zion Golumbic et al., 2013 ). We predicted that increased attention to auditory feedback under adverse speaking conditions, such as during an auditory feedback perturbation task, should increase feedback sensitivity and elicit larger responses in the auditory cortex compared to normal speech production. To summarize, in this study we aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in human neurophysiological recordings. We predicted that auditory sites showing speech-induced suppression would elicit enhanced responses to auditory feedback perturbations. Further, we aimed to investigate the role of attention in auditory feedback sensitivity by comparing auditory responses during an auditory feedback perturbation task compared with normal speech production. To address these aims, we used intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings in neurosurgical participants, which offers a level of spatial detail and temporal precision that would not be possible to achieve using non-invasive techniques. We first identified the sites that show auditory suppression during speech production, and then employed a DAF paradigm to test whether the same sites show sensitivity to perturbed feedback. Our results revealed that overlapping sites in the superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback with a strong correlation between the two measures, supporting the hypothesis that auditory suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors in humans. Further, we showed that auditory responses in the posterior STG are enhanced in a DAF task compared to normal speech production, even for trials in which participants receive simultaneous auditory feedback ( no-delay condition ). This result suggests that increased attention during an auditory feedback perturbation task can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity and posterior STG is a critical region for this attentional modulation. 
 In order to assess cortical responses during perception and production of speech, and quantify speech-induced auditory suppression, participants ( n=35 ) performed an auditory word repetition ( AWR ) task. We examined the response patterns in seven different cortical regions including STG, middle temporal gyrus ( MTG ), supramarginal gyrus ( SMG ), inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ), middle frontal gyrus ( MFG ), precentral gyrus ( preCG ), and postcentral gyrus ( postCG ) ( Figure 1A ). As an index of the neural response, we used the high gamma broadband signal ( 70–150 Hz, see Materials and methods ), which correlates with the spiking activity of the underlying neuronal population ( Mukamel et al., 2005; Crone et al., 2006; Cardin et al., 2009; Ray and Maunsell, 2011; Lachaux et al., 2012 ). We analyzed the responses in two different time windows: during passive listening of the auditory stimulus ( 0–500 ms after stimulus onset ) and during speaking when participants repeated the perceived auditory stimulus ( 0–500 ms after articulation onset ). Average responses were larger during passive listening in STG ( average % signal change ± SEM; Listen: 62. 1±0. 6, Speak: 29. 8±0. 4 ), MTG ( 32. 7±0. 9, 22. 3±0. 9 ), and SMG ( 27. 4±0. 8, 25. 8±0. 7 ) compared with speaking. Conversely, responses were larger during speaking in IFG ( 29. 2±1. 3, 31. 2±1. 3 ), MFG ( 28. 3±1. 6, 31. 4±1. 3 ), preCG ( 27. 4±0. 4, 37±0. 5 ), and postCG ( 26±0. 4, 42±0. 5 ). These results suggested that auditory regions responded more strongly during passive listening than speaking in STG, MT, and SMG, and less during speaking in IFG, MFG, preCG, and postCG ( Figure 1B ). To quantify speech-induced suppression, we calculated the difference between responses during speaking and listening in each region ( Figure 1C ). The largest suppression was observed in STG ( % change ± SEM; 32.8± 0.6 ), followed by MTG ( 5.± 0.9 ) and SMG ( 2.± 0.7 ) and smallest in IFG ( 2.1.1 ), MFG 1.1, preCG 1.0, and post 0.9. These results indicate that auditory responses in ST, MT, and SM are suppressed during speech compared with passive listening, while responses in IF, M, pre, and post are enhanced. Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to test whether sites showing speech-induced suppression are sensitive to feedback ( Figure 2 ). In the DAF paradigm, participants heard their own voice delayed by 200 ms after articulation, which disrupts speech fluency ( Lee,195; Fairbanks,195; Stuart et al,2002 ). We analyzed responses in the same seven regions during DAF and compared with normal production ( Figure 2 ). During DAF, responses were larger in ST ( % change ± SEM; DAF 42.± 1, Speak 29.8±.4 ), MT (33.±.9, 22.3.9 ) and SM (30.±.8, 25.8. ) compared with normal production. Conversely, responses were smaller in IF (29.1.3, 31.2. ) M (28.6., 31.4 ) pre (27..4, 37.5 ) and post (26.,42.5 ). These results indicate that sites showing speech-induced suppression in ST, MT, SM are sensitive to auditory feedback and exhibit enhanced responses during DAF. The correlation between speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to feedback was strong in ST ( r=0.8, p<.001 ) and MT ( r0.6, p.01 ) but not significant in SM ( r0.2,.05 ). These findings support the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression enables detection of errors by increasing sensitivity to auditory feedback. Finally, we investigated the role of attention in auditory sensitivity by comparing responses during an auditory perturbation task with normal production ( Figure 3 ). In the DAF paradigm, participants heard their own voice delayed by 200 ms which disrupts speech fluency ( Lee,195; Fair,195; Stuart et al2002 ). We analyzed responses in seven regions during DAF and normal production ( Figure 3 ). During D, responses were larger in ST ( % change SEM; D 42.1, Speak 29.4 ) MT (33.9, 22.3 ) and SM (30.8 25. ) compared normal. Conversely, responses smaller in IF (29.3, 31. ) M (28.6 31. ) pre (27. 37 ) and post (26.42 ) These results indicate that sites showing speech-induced in ST, MT, SM are sensitive to feedback and exhibit larger responses during D. The correlation between speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to feedback was strong in ST ( r0.8 p.001 ) and MT (.6.01 ) but not in SM (.05 ). These findings suggest that increased attention during an auditory perturbation modulates feedback sensitivity and ST is a critical region for attentional modulation. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression enables detection of errors by increasing sensitivity to auditory feedback. We found that sites showing suppression

    Title: 
    Article: A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ), YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over. 
 All organisms are subject to an incessant barrage of genetic parasites, such as viruses and transposons. Over billions of years, the continuous arms race between hosts and parasites drove the evolution of immense, intricately interconnected networks of diverse defense systems and pathways ( Burroughs et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2020; Goldfarb et al., 2015; Bell et al., 2020; Koonin and Aravind, 2002; Swarts et al., 2014 ). In particular, in the last few years, targeted searches for defense systems in prokaryotes, typically capitalizing on the presence of variable genomic defense islands, have dramatically expanded their known diversity and led to the discovery of a plethora of biological conflict strategies and mechanisms ( Gao et al., 2020; Bell et al., 2020; Anantharaman et al., 2012; Kaur et al., 2020 ). One of the most ancient and common forms of defense against mobile genetic elements ( MGE ) is the targeted restriction of nucleic acids. Since the initial discovery of this activity among strains of bacteria resistant to certain viruses, myriad forms of recognition and degradation of nucleic acids have been described, in virtually all life forms. Characterization of the most prominent of these systems, such as restriction-modification ( RM ), RNA interference ( RNAi ), and CRISPR-Cas ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated genes ), has led to the development of a profusion of highly effective experimental and therapeutic techniques, in particular, genome editing and engineering ( Loenen et al., 2014; Fire et al., 1998; Agrawal et al., 2003; Makarova et al., 2006; Makarova et al., 2020b; Gasiunas et al., 2012; Jinek et al., 2012 ). Historically, the two-component McrBC ( modified cytosine restriction ) system was the first form of restriction to be described, although the mechanism remained obscure for decades, and for a time, this system was referred to as RglB ( restriction of glucoseless phages ) due to its ability to restrict T-even phage DNA which contained hydroxymethylcytosine, but not glucosylated bases ( Raleigh et al., 1989; Luria and Human, 1952; Fleischman et al., 1976; Dila et al., 1990 ). Today, the prototypical McrBC system, native to Escherichia coil K-12, is considered a Type IV ( modification-dependent ) restriction system that degrades DNA containing methylcytosine ( 5mC ) or hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ), with a degree of sequence context specificity ( Sutherland et al., 1992; Sukackaite et al., 2012 ). Type IV restriction enzymes contain at least two components: ( 1 ) a dedicated specificity domain that recognizes modified DNA and ( 2 ) an endonuclease domain that cleaves the target ( Weigele and Raleigh, 2016; Loenen et al., 2014 ). In the well-characterized example from E. coli K-12, McrB harbors an N-terminal DUF ( domain of unknown function ) 3578 that recognizes methylcytosine. We denote this domain, as its function is not unknown, as ADAM ( a domain with an affinity for methylcytosine ). The ADAM domain is fused to a GTPase domain of the AAA+ATPase superfamily, the only known GTPase in this clade, which is believed to translocate DNA ( Figure 1A and B; Sutherland et al., 1992; Iyer et al., 2004a; Nirwan et al., 2019; Panne et al., 1999 ). McrC, encoded by a separate gene in the same operon, contains an N-terminal DUF2357 domain, which interacts with the GTPase domain in McrB and stimulates its activity, and is fused to a PD- ( D/E ) xK superfamily endonuclease ( Figure 1A and C; Niu et al., 2020; Sutherland et al., 1992 ). Our recent analysis of the modified base-binding EVE ( named for Protein Data Bank PDB structural identifier 2eve ) domain superfamily demonstrated how the distribution of the EVE-like domains connects the elaborate eukaryotic RNA regulation and RNA interference-related epigenetic silencing pathways to largely uncharacterized prokaryotic antiphage restriction systems ( Bell et al., 2020 ). EVE superfamily domains, which in eukaryotes recognize modified DNA or RNA as part of mRNA maturation or epigenetic silencing functions, are often fused to McrB-like GTPases in prokaryotes, and indeed, these are the most frequently occurring EVE-containing fusion proteins ( Bell et al., 2020 ). These observations motivated us to conduct a comprehensive computational search for McrBC systems, followed by a census of all associated domains, to chart the vast and diverse population of antiviral specificity modules, vital for prokaryotic defense, that also provided important source material during the evolution of central signature features of eukaryotic cells. Here we present the results of this census and describe an extraordinary, not previously appreciated variety of domain architectures of the McrBC family of Type IV restriction systems. In particular, we focus on a major McrBC branch that we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandem ( CoCoNuT ) systems, which we explore in detail. 
 The search for McrBC systems included PSI-BLAST runs against the non-redundant protein sequence database at the NCBI, followed by several filtering strategies ( see ‘Methods’ ) to obtain a clean set of nearly 34, 000, distributed broadly among prokaryotes. In the subsequent phase of analysis, GTPase domain sequences were extracted from the McrB homolog pool, and DUF2357 and PD- ( D/E ) xK nuclease domain sequences were extracted from the McrC homolog pool, leaving as a remainder the fused specificity domains that we intended to classify ( although the McrC homologs are not the primary bearers of specificity modules in McrBC systems, they can be fused to various additional domains, including those of the EVE superfamily ) ( Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Unexpectedly, we found that both the GTPase domains and DUF2357 domains frequently contained insertions into their coding sequences, likely encoding specificity domains and coiled-coils, respectively. Removing variable inserts from the conserved McrBC domains allowed accurate, comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the McrB GTPase ( Figure 2 ) and McrC DUF2357 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) families. These two trees were generally topologically concordant and revealed several distinct branches not previously recognized. The branch containing the prototypical McrBC system from E. coil K-12 ( Figure 2, blue ) is characterized by frequent genomic association with Type I RM systems, usually with unidirectional gene orientations and the potential of forming a single operon ( Raleigh, 1992 ). This branch and the CoNuT branch ( Figure 2, red ), which we focus on, is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil structures and nuclease domains. The CoNu branch diverged from the prototypical McBC at an early stage of evolution ( Figure 2 ). The CoNu branch contains three distinct types ( I, II, and III ) and multiple subtypes ( A, B, C, and D ) ( Figure 2, Figure 2— supplement 1, Figure 2— supplement 2, Figure— supplement 3, Figure— supplement 4, Figure— supplement 5, Figure— supplement 6, Figure— supplement 7, Figure— supplement 8, Figure— supplement 9, Figure— supplement 10, Figure— supplement 11, Figure— supplement 12, Figure— supplement 13, Figure— supplement 14, Figure— supplement 15, Figure— supplement 16, Figure— supplement 17, Figure— supplement 18, Figure— supplement 19, Figure— supplement, Figure 20,— supplement, Figure 21,— supplement, Figure 22,— supplement, Figure 23,— supplement, Figure 24, supplement, Figure 25— supplement, Figure 26, supplement, Figure 27— supplement, Figure 28, supplement, Figure 29— supplement, Figure 30,— supplement, Figure 31,— supplement, Figure 32,— supplement, Figure 33— supplement, Figure 34, supplement, Figure 35— supplement, Figure 36,— supplement, Figure 37,— supplement, Figure 38,— supplement, Figure 39,—, supplement, Figure 40—, supplement, Figure 41—, supplement, Figure 42,— supplement, Figure 43—, supplement, Figure 44, supplement, Figure— 45, supplement, Figure 46—, supplement, Figure 47,— supplement, Figure 48,— supplement, Figure 49,— supplement, Figure 50,— supplement, Figure 51—, supplement, Figure 52,— supplement, Figure 53,— supplement, Figure 54,—, supplement, Figure 55—, supplement, Figure 56—, supplement, Figure 57—, supplement, Figure 58,— supplement, Figure 59—, supplement, Figure 60,— supplement, Figure 61—, supplement, Figure 62,— supplement, Figure 63,— supplement, Figure 64,— supplement, Figure 65—, supplement, Figure 66,— supplement, Figure 67,— supplement, Figure 68,— supplement, Figure 69,— supplement, Figure 70—, supplement, Figure 71—, supplement, Figure 72,— supplement, Figure 73—, supplement, Figure 74,— supplement, Figure 75,— supplement, Figure 76—, supplement, Figure 77,— supplement, Figure 78,— supplement, Figure 79—, supplement, Figure 80—, supplement, Figure 81—, supplement, Figure 82—, supplement, Figure 83,— supplement, Figure 84—, supplement, Figure 85—, supplement, Figure 86,— supplement, Figure 87—, supplement, Figure 88,— supplement, Figure 89,— supplement, Figure 90—, supplement, Figure 91—, supplement, Figure 92,— supplement, Figure 93,— supplement, Figure 94,— supplement, Figure 95—, supplement, Figure 96—, supplement, Figure 97—, supplement, Figure 98,— supplement, Figure 99,— supplement, Figure 100—, supplement, Figure 101—, supplement, Figure 102,— supplement, Figure 103,— supplement, Figure, 104

    Title: 
    Article: Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension. 
 Interventions that enhance lifespan also impart resistance to multiple stresses ( Johnson et al., 2001 ). Indeed, the positive correlation between improved stress resistance and enhanced lifespan has been exploited to identify long-lived mutants ( de Castro et al., 2004; Denzel et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2001; Muñoz and Riddle, 2003; Wang et al., 2004 ). Among stress responses, innate immunity appears to be a crucial factor for enhanced lifespan ( Campos et al., 2021; Fabian et al., 2021; Soo et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2019 ). However, the correlation between innate immunity and lifespan is not always positive. Interventions that alter lifespan may not modulate innate immunity, and vice-versa ( Labed et al., 2018; Naim et al., 2021; Otarigho and Aballay, 2020; Sun et al., 2011 ). Some signaling pathways also establish a tradeoff between innate immunity and lifespan. Mutants that have improved immunity but reduced lifespan have been identified ( Amrit et al., 2019; Otarigho and Aballay, 2021; Ren and Ambros, 2015 ). Conversely, mutants with enhanced lifespans but declined immune responses have also been discovered ( Kawli et al., 2010 ). Moreover, the genetic pathways for lifespan and immunity could be uncoupled in mutants exhibiting enhanced lifespan and improved immune responses ( Alper et al., 2010; Guerrero et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the relationship between lifespan and innate immunity appears to be complex and remains to be fully understood. Calcineurin, a conserved protein from yeast to humans, is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways ( Chen et al., 2022; Hogan et al., 2003; Schulz and Yutzey, 2004; Ulengin-Talkish and Cyert, 2023 ). Dephosphorylation of substrate proteins by calcineurin affects several cellular pathways, including transcriptional signaling programs ( Ulengin-Talkish and Cyert, 2023 ). Calcineurin regulates the activity of the transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family ( Hogan et al., 2003 ). Dephosphorylation of NFATs by calcineurin triggers their nuclear localization and activates immune responses in vertebrates ( Herbst et al., 2015; Hogan et al., 2003; Vandewalle et al., 2014 ). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, calcineurin regulates thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2007; Kuhara et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2013 ). Knockdown of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, tax-6, is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via multiple pathways, including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators ( CRTCs; Dong et al., 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 ). However, the role of calcineurin in regulating C. elegans response to pathogen infections has not been studied. Because C. elegans lacks the NFAT transcription factors ( Song et al., 2013 ), it will be intriguing to study how calcineurin inhibition impacts C. elegans innate immunity. These studies could also shed some light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity. In this study, we examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity. Surprisingly, we found that the knockdown of tax-6 enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan. We discovered that tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ). The knockdown of tax-6 resulted in intestinal bloating due to defects in the DMP, which enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection by increasing gut colonization by bacteria. Intestinal bloating resulted in calorie restriction-like phenotypes, including reduced lipid levels, and led to increased lifespan. We discovered that the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for calcineurin inhibition-mediated lifespan extension. Moreover, we found that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension. 
 To understand the role of calcineurin in the innate immune response of C. elegans, we examined the survival of a hypomorphic allele of tax-6, tax-6 ( p675 ), when exposed to the pathogenic bacterium P. aeruginosa PA14. Surprisingly, tax-6 ( p675 ) mutants showed significantly reduced survival on P. aeruginosa compared to wild-type N2 animals ( Figure 1A ). Similarly, animals carrying a null allele of tax-6, tax-6 ( ok2065 ), also exhibited a significant decrease in survival on P. aeruginosa compared to N2 animals ( Figure 1B ). In addition, knockdown of tax-6 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa relative to control animals ( Figure 1C ). The RNAi effects were specific to tax-6, as tax-6 ( p675 ) mutants did not show further increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa when subjected to tax-6 RNAi ( Figure 1D ). As reported earlier ( Dong et al., 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 ), we confirmed that both tax-6 loss of function and RNAi knockdown led to an increased lifespan on E. coli ( Figure 1E and F ). An earlier study demonstrated that calcineurin regulates cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) and CRTCs to regulate lifespan in C. elegans ( Mair et al., 2011 ). The knockdown of the CREB homolog-1 ( crh-1 ) and crtc-1 enhanced lifespan similar to the tax-6 knockdown ( Mair et al., 2011 ). We investigated whether crh-1 and crtc-1 knockdowns also affected C. elegans survival on P. aeruginosa as severely as tax-6 knockdown. Interestingly, crh-1 and crtc-1 knockdowns did not compromise survival on P. aeruginosa as much as tax-6 knockdown did ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). These findings suggested that, despite the increased lifespan, tax-6 knockdown animals exhibit markedly enhanced susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection through a mechanism likely independent of crh-1 and crtc-1. We observed enhanced matricidal hatching in tax-6 knockdown animals on P. aeruginosa. Therefore, we asked whether the enhanced susceptibility of tax-6 knockdown animals to P. aeruginosa was because of enhanced matricidal hatching. To this end, we studied the effects of tax-6 knockdown in fer-1 ( b232 ) temperature-sensitive mutants. When grown at 25 °C, fer-1 ( b232 ) animals have unfertilized oocytes ( Argon and Ward, 1980 ), thus eliminating the possibility of matricidal hatching. As shown in Figure 1G, even in the absence of matricidal hatching, fer-1 ( b232 ) animals exhibited reduced survival on P. aeruginosa following tax-6 knockdown, indicating that the increased susceptibility is not due to enhanced matricidal hatching. Moreover, fer-1 b (232 ) tax-6 knockdown animals showed increased susceptibility to P aerugin compared to wild-type fer-1 animals ( Figure 1H ). These results indicate that tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defec motor program DMP, and its inhibition leads to intestinal bloating and increased susceptibility to P aerugin infection. The DMP is essential for the rhythmic defecation of C. elegans and is regulated by the G-protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway ( Kim et al, 2007 ). We investigated whether PKA is involved in the tax-6 -mediated susceptibility to P aerugin. We found that inhibition of PK with the inhibitor H-89 reduced susceptibility to P. aerugin in tax-6 knock animals ( Figure 1I ), suggesting that PK is involved in the tax- mediated susceptibility to P. aerugin. The DMP is also regulated by the G-protein kinase C ( PKC ) pathway ( Kim et al,2007 ) We tested whether PKC is involved in tax- mediated susceptibility to P. aerugin and found that inhibition of PKC with Gö6976 reduced susceptibility to P. aer in tax-6 animals ( Figure 1 ) indicating that PKC is also involved in tax- mediated susceptibility to P aerugin. The DMP is also regulated by the G-protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway ( Kim et al,2007 ) We tested whether PKA is involved in tax- mediated susceptibility to P aer and found that inhibition of PK with H89 reduced susceptibility to P. aer in tax- animals ( Figure 1 ) indicating that PKA is also involved in tax- mediated susceptibility P aer. The DMP is also regulated by the G-protein kinase ( PK ) pathway ( Kim et,200 ) We tested whether PK is involved in tax- mediated susceptibility P aer and found that inhibition of PK with Gö6976 reduced susceptibility to P. in tax- animals ( Figure 1 ) indicating PK is involved in tax mediated susceptibility P. The DMP is regulated by the G-protein kinase ( PK ) pathway ( Kim et,200 ) We tested whether PK is involved in tax mediated P and found that inhibition with Gö6 reduced susceptibility to P in tax- animals ( Figure ) indicating PK is involved tax mediated P. The D is regulated by G-protein kinase ( ) pathway ( Kim et200 ) We tested whether is involved in tax and found that with Gö6 reduced susceptibility to in tax ( Figure ) indicating is involved tax. The D is regulated by G-protein ( Kim200 ) tested whether is in tax and found that Gö reduced to in tax ( ) indicating is tax The D is regulated by-pro ( Kim ) tested whether in and found Gö to ( ) indicating The D is regulated by-pro ( Kim ) tested in and found Gö ( ) The D is regulated ( Kim ) tested in and found ( ) The D regulated ( Kim ) in found ( ) The regulated ( Kim ) found ( ) The ( Kim ) found ( ) ( ) The ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )

    Title: 
    Article: Cognitive control resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. As conflicts can arise from different sources ( e. g., sensory input, internal representations ), how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a major challenge. Based on the cognitive space theory, different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a ( low-dimensional ) cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions. It leads to a hypothesis that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space. We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts. 
 Cognitive control enables humans to behave purposefully by modulating neural processing to resolve conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information. For example, when naming the color of the word ‘BLUE’ printed in red ink, we are likely to be distracted by the word meaning, because reading a word is highly automatic in daily life. To keep our attention on the color, we need to mobilize the cognitive control processes to resolve the conflict between the color and word by boosting/suppressing the processing of color/word meaning. As task-relevant and task-irrelevant information can come from different sources, the sources of conflicts and how they should be resolved can vary greatly ( Kornblum et al., 1990 ). For example, the conflict may occur between items of sensory information, such as between a red light and a police officer signaling cars to pass. Alternatively, conflict may occur between sensory and motor information, such as when a voice on the left asks you to turn right. A key unsolved question in cognitive control is how our brain efficiently resolves these different types of conflicts. A first step to addressing this question is to examine the commonalities and/or dissociations across different types of conflicts that can be categorized into different domains. Examples of the domains of conflicts include experimental paradigm ( Freitas et al., 2007; Magen and Cohen, 2007 ), sensory modality ( Hazeltine et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2017 ), or conflict type regarding the dimensional overlap of conflict processes ( Jiang and Egner, 2014; Liu et al., 2004 ). Two solutions to resolving different conflict types are proposed. They differ based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. On the one hand, the domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment ( i. e., encountering a conflict trial from one type can facilitate conflict resolution of another type ) ( Freitas et al., 2007; Kan et al., 2013 ) and similar neural patterns ( Peterson et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2020 ) across distinct conflict tasks. A broader domain-general view holds that the frontoparietal brain regions/networks are widely involved in multiple control demands well beyond the conflict domain ( Assem et al., 2020; Cole et al., 2013 ), which explains the remarkable flexibility in human behaviors. However, since domain-general processes are by definition likely shared by different tasks, when we need to handle multiple task demands at the same time, the efficiency of both tasks would be impaired due to resource competition or interference ( Musslick and Cohen, 2021 ). Therefore, the domain-general processes are evolutionarily less advantageous for humans to deal with the diverse situations requiring high efficiency ( Cosmides and Tooby, 1994 ). On the other hand, the domain-specific theories argue that different types of conflicts are handled by distinct cognitive control processes ( e. g., where and how information processing should be modulated ) ( Egner, 2008; Kim et al., 2012 ). However, according to the domain-specific view, the diverse conflict situations require a multitude of preexisting control processes, which is biologically implausible ( Abrahamse et al., 2016 ). To reconcile the two theories, researchers recently proposed that cognitive control might be a mixture of domain-general and domain-specific processes. For instance, Freitas and Clark, 2015 found that trial-by-trial adjustment of control can generalize across two conflict domains to different degrees, leading to domain-general ( strong generalization ) or domain-specific ( weak or no generalization ) conclusions depending on the task settings of the consecutive conflicts. Similarly, different brain networks may show domain-generality ( i. e., representing multiple conflicts ) or domain-specificity ( i. e., representing individual conflicts separately ) ( Jiang and Egner, 2014; Li et al., 2017 ). Even within the same brain area ( e. g., medial frontal cortex ), Fu et al., 2022 found that the neural population activity can be factorized into orthogonal dimensions encoding both domain-general and domain-specific conflict information, which can be selectively read out by downstream brain regions. While the mixture view provides an explanation for the contradictory findings ( Braem et al., 2014 ), it suffers the same criticism as domain-specific cognitive control theories as it still requires many cognitive control processes to fully cover all possible conflicts. A key to reconciling domain-general and domain-specific cognitive control is to organize the large number of conflict types using a system with limited, dissociable dimensions. A construct with a similar function is the cognitive space ( Bellmund et al., 2018 ), which extends the idea of cognitive map ( Behrens et al., 2018 ) to the representation of abstract information. Critically, the cognitive space view holds that the representations of different abstract information are organized continuously and the representational geometry in the cognitive space is determined by the similarity among the represented information ( Bellmund et al., 2018 ). In the human brain, it has been shown that abstract ( Behrens et al., 2018; Schuck et al., 2016 ) and social ( Park et al., 2020 ) information can be represented in a cognitive space. For example, social hierarchies with two independent scores ( e. g., popularity and competence ) can be represented in a 2D cognitive space ( one dimension for each score ), such that each social item can be located by its score in the two dimensions ( Park et al., 2020 ). In the field of cognitive control, recent studies have begun to conceptualize different control states within a cognitive space ( Badre et al., 2021 ). For example, Fu et al., 2022 mapped different conflict conditions to locations in a low-/high-dimensional cognitive space to demonstrate the domain-general/domain-specific problems; Grahek et al., 2022 used a cognitive space model of cognitive control settings to explain behavioral changes in the speed-accuracy tradeoff. However, the cognitive spaces proposed in these studies were only applicable to a limited number of control states involved in their designs. Therefore, it remains unclear whether there is a cognitive space that can explain the large number of control states, similar to that of the spatial location ( Bellmund et al., 2018 ) and non-spatial knowledge ( Behrens et al., 2018 ). A challenge to answering this question lies in how to construct control states with continuous levels of similarity. Our recent work ( Yang et al., 2021 ) showed that it is possible to manipulate continuous conflict similarity by using a mixture of two independent conflict types with varying ratios, which can be used to further examine the behavioral and neural evidence for the cognitive space view. It is also unclear how the cognitive space of cognitive control is encoded in the brain, although that of spatial locations and non-spatial abstract knowledge has been relatively well investigated in the medial temporal lobe, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal system ( Behrens et al., 2018; Bellmund et al., 2018 ). Recent research has suggested that the abstract task structure could be encoded and implemented by the frontoparietal network ( Vaidya and Badre, 2022; Vaidya et al., 2021 ), but whether a similar neural system encodes the cognitive space of cognitive control remains untested. The present study aimed to test the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation. Specifically, we hypothesize that different types of conflicts are represented as points in a cognitive space. Importantly, the distance between the points, which reflects the geometry of the cognitive space, scales with the difference in the sources of the conflicts being represented by the points. The dimensions in the cognitive space of conflicts can be the aforementioned domains, in which domain-specific cognitive control processes are defined. For a specific type of conflict, its location in the cognitive space can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates, which reflect how much control is needed for each of the domain-specific cognitive control processes. The cognitive space can also represent different types of conflicts with low dimensionality ( Badre et al., 2021; MacDowell et al., 2022 ). Different domains can be represented conjunctively in a single cognitive space to achieve domain-general cognitive control as conflicts from different sources can be resolved using the same set of control processes. We designed a task with five types of conflicts that can be parameterized as points in a 2D cognitive space. Participants performed the task while fMRI activity was recorded in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results show that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity in the cognitive space, supporting the hypothesis that the space is a principle for representing conflicts. We also found that neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex scales with the distance between points in the space, suggesting that the space is encoded in the brain. Our results provide evidence for the cognitive view that conflicts are represented in a low-dimensional space and can be resolved by a set of control processes working along the dimensions. The findings have implications for our understanding of cognitive control and its neural basis in the brain. 

The article discusses the concept of cognitive control and its role in resolving conflicts between task-relevant and task-ir information. The authors propose that different types of conflicts can be parameterized and represented as points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes working along dimensions. They designed a task with five types of conflicts and found that human performance and fMRI patterns in the rightolateral prefrontal cortex support that types are organized based on similarity, suggesting the space as a principle for representing conflicts.

    Title: 
    Article: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [sPTL] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [PPROM] ) membranes. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response. Thus, we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators, referred to herein as the immunoproteome, in a population at high risk for sPTB. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, sPTL, or PPROM. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations. Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile. Yet, the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM. Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks ) sPTB. The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes. This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C. ALT, KRT, and NGL were supported by the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal, Perinatal and Child Health. 
 Preterm birth, defined as live birth before 37 weeks of gestation ( American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2021 ), afflicts 1 of every 10 children born worldwide ( Chawanpaiboon et al., 2019; Martin and Hamilton, 2021 ). The economic burden of preterm birth amounts to more than $25. 2 billion in healthcare costs annually in the United States alone ( Waitzman et al., 2021 ). Two-thirds of preterm births occur spontaneously ( i. e., spontaneous preterm birth [sPTB] ) ( Goldenberg et al., 2008 ), while the remainder are due to evident clinical conditions ( e. g., preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction ) that jeopardize maternal–fetal well-being and require medically indicated delivery ( i. e., iatrogenic preterm birth ) ( Goldenberg et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2014a ). sPTB can be further subdivided into spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes ( sPTL ) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes ( PPROM ) ( Goldenberg et al., 2008 ). The pathogenesis of sPTL and PPROM can include local inflammatory processes ( Romero et al., 2014a ) ; yet, each is considered a syndrome with distinct underlying mechanisms of disease ( Goldenberg et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2014a ) and thus requiring different clinical managements ( American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016; Dvorakova and Ivankova, 2020 ). Therefore, research focused on the prediction and prevention of sPTB should account for the distinct inflammatory nature of sPTL and PPROM. Multiple attempts have been made to predict sPTB using data from noninvasive sampling coupled with omics platforms such as genomics ( Frey et al., 2016; Modi et al., 2017; Modi et al., 2018; Jain et al., 2022 ), transcriptomics ( Ngo et al., 2018; Jehan et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2020; Tarca et al., 2021; Camunas-Soler et al., 2022 ), and proteomics ( Peterson et al., 2020; Jehan et al., 2020; Tarca et al., 2021; Tiensuu et al., 2022 ). Yet, to date, assessment of cervical length remains the strongest and most cost-effective predictor of sPTB: women with a sonographic short cervix ( ≤ 25 mm ) are sixfold more likely to deliver a preterm neonate ( Iams et al., 1996 ), and tailored treatment with natural progesterone reduces such risk by half ( Fonseca et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2011; Romero et al., 2014b; Romero et al., 2016; Romero et al., 2017; Conde-Agudelo et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2018 ). Indeed, personalized cervical length assessment that accounts for maternal characteristics and obstetrical history was shown to improve prediction relative to raw cervical length data ( Gudicha et al., 2021 ) ; however, additional biomarkers are still needed to further increase prediction performance. Growing evidence has fostered the hypothesis that cervical disease is associated with changes in the vaginal ecosystem ( Kindinger et al., 2017; Witkin et al., 2019; Di Paola et al., 2020; Gerson et al., 2020 ). Thus, intensive investigation has focused on the vaginal microbiome and its potential utility for predicting sPTB ( Donders et al., 2009; DiGiulio et al., 2015; Kindinger et al., 2017; Freitas et al., 2018; Fettweis et al., 2019; Odogwu et al., 2021; Payne et al., 2021; Flaviani et al., 2021; Pruski et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ). However, models utilizing vaginal microbiome data alone have displayed weak predictive power ( Freitas et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2021; Pruski et al., 2021 ), potentially due to sample size, sequencing depth, and ethnicity-driven differences in microbial community profile. Recent models, however, have leveraged vaginal host–microbe interactions by incorporating the determination of immune mediators, which improved the prediction of sPTB ( Elovitz et al., 2019; Fettweis et al., 2019; Pruski et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, an extensive interrogation of the vaginal soluble immune response ( i. e., the vaginal immunoproteome ), with consideration of the distinction between sPTL and PPROM cases, has not been undertaken. Herein, we conducted the largest assessment, based on the study’s scale, longitudinal nature, and depth of immunological mediators evaluated, of the vaginal immunoproteome during uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies. Importantly, our determinations were performed in vaginal samples collected during all three trimesters and considered sPTB, including its two subsets ( i. e., sPTL and PPROM ), as well as the timing of delivery ( i. e., early and late sPTB ). Furthermore, the immunological mediators evaluated were selected for their relevance to key biological processes in the vaginal ecosystem. Additionally, we used machine learning approaches and cross-validation to generate and assess predictive models for sPTL and PPROM in our high-risk population. 
 This study represents the largest ( N = 739 women, n = 2819 samples ) and most comprehensive ( 31 immune mediators ) profiling of the soluble immune response in vaginal fluid throughout well-characterized pregnancies that culminated in the delivery of a term neonate ( controls ) or those that resulted in sPTB ( sPTL and PPROM cases ) ( Figure 1A ). Specifically, we enrolled pregnant women from whom vaginal swabs were collected at different points throughout gestation. Patients were followed until delivery, after which we selected women who underwent sPTL or PPROM with delivery before 37 weeks of gestation ( preterm birth ) and women with a normal term delivery as controls ( matched by gestational age at sampling at a 2:1 ratio ). All patients had a singleton pregnancy without fetal anomalies and had at least three vaginal samples available. Patients were classified into three study groups according to pregnancy outcome and diagnosis: ( i ) women who delivered at term ( 494 patients, 66. 7 % ), ( ii ) women who experienced sL ( 143, 19. 5 % ), and ( iii ) women who experienced PPROM (102, 13. 8 % ) ( Figure 1A ). The immunological mediators in vaginal fluid were quantified using specific and sensitive immunoassays ( Table 1 ). We selected 31 mediators based on their relevance to biological processes in the vaginal ecosystem, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides ( Table 2 ). These mediators were chosen for their role in inflammation, immune response, and antimicrobial activity ( Table 2 ). The immunological mediators were quantified in vaginal samples from all three trimesters of gestation ( Table 3 ), including samples from women who experienced sL and PPROM ( Table 4 ) and those who delivered at term ( Table 5 ). We constructed predictive models for sL and PP using machine learning approaches and cross-validation ( Table 6 ). The models were trained on data from uncomplicated pregnancies and tested on complicated pregnancies ( sL and PP ). The performance of the models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves and area under the curve ( AUC ) ( Table 7 ). The predictive value of the immunoprote was compared to maternal characteristics alone ( Table 8 ) and other biomarkers ( Table 9 ) in identifying women at risk for early sB ( < 34 weeks ). Our results show that the immunop harbors a homeostatic profile throughout uncomplicated gestation. However, the immunop is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in women who experience sL and PP ( Figure 2 ). The pro-inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides ( Figure 3 ). The immunop has predictive value over maternal alone for identifying women at risk for early sB ( Figure 4 ). The immunop undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sB ( Figure 5 ). The immun can be leveraged as a biomarker for earlyB a subset ofB associated with adverse neonatal outcomes ( Figure 6 ).

    Title: 
    Article: The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure. Here, we describe an in silico model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. Although experimental data suggest that KV1. 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that the KV1. 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In female cells, which have larger KV2. 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes, predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that KV2. 1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential. Over the physiological range of membrane potentials, the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability. We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel, female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. In summary, we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs. 
 Our primary objective was to develop and implement a novel computational model that comprehensively describes the essential mechanisms underlying electrical activity and Ca2+ dynamics in arterial myocytes. We aimed to uncover the key components necessary and sufficient to fully understand the behavior of arterial vascular smooth muscle myocytes and the cellular response to variations in pressure. The model represents the first-ever integration of sex-specific variations in voltage-gated KV2. 1 and CaV1. 2 channels, enabling the prediction of sex-specific disparities in membrane potential and the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells from systemic arteries. To further investigate sex-specific responses to antihypertensive medications, we extended our investigation to include a one-dimensional ( 1D ) representation of tissue. This approach enabled us to simulate and forecast the effects of Ca2+ channel blockers within the controlled environment of an idealized mesenteric vessel. It is worth noting that this computational framework can be expanded to predict the consequences of antihypertensive drugs and other perturbations, transitioning seamlessly from single-cell to tissue-level simulations. Previous mathematical models ( Jacobsen et al., 2007; Kapela et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2003; Parthimos et al., 1999 ) of vascular smooth muscle myocytes generated to describe the membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells have described the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by endogenous or pharmacological vasoactive agents activating inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) and ryanodine ( RyR ) receptors, resulting in the initiation of calcium waves. Earlier models have also provided insights into the contraction activation by agonists and the behavior of vasomotion. In a major step forward, the Karlin model ( Karlin, 2015 ) incorporated new cell structure data and electrophysiology experimental data in a computational model that predicted the essential behavior of membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling arising from intracellular domains found in arterial myocytes. One notable limitation of earlier models is that they are based entirely on data from male animals. Furthermore, many data used to parameterize the Karlin model were obtained from smooth muscle from cerebral arteries. While cerebral arteries are important for brain blood flow, they do not control systemic blood pressure. Furthermore, they do not take into consideration the role of KV2. 1 channels in the regulation of smooth muscle cell membrane potential. The function of the smooth muscle cells that wrap around small arteries is to regulate the diameter of these vessels. Arterial myocytes contract in response to increases in intravascular pressure ( Bayliss, 1902 ). Based on work largely done using cerebral arterial smooth muscle, a model has been proposed in which this myogenic response is initiated when membrane stretch activates Na+-permeable canonical TRPC6 ( Welsh et al., 2002; Spassova et al., 2006 ) and melastatin-type TRPM4 ( Earley et al., 2004b; Earley et al., 2007 ). A recent study in smooth muscle from mesenteric arteries identified two additional TRP channels to the chain of events that link increases in intravascular pressure to arterial myocyte depolarization: TRPP1 ( PKD1 ) and TRPP2 ( PKD2 ) channels ( Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009; Bulley et al., 2018 ). Together, these studies point to an elaborate multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in sensing pressure and initiating the myogenic response by inducing membrane depolarization and activating voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type CaV1. 2 Ca2+ channels ( Moosmang et al., 2003; Knot and Nelson, 1998a ). Ca2+ entry via a single or small cluster of CaV1. 2 channels produces a local increase in intracellular free Ca2+ ( [Ca2+]i ) called a ‘CaV1. 2 sparklet’ ( Navedo and Santana, 2013; Navedo et al., 2005; Navedo et al., 2006; Amberg et al., 2007 ). Activation of multiple CaV1. 2 sparklets produces a global increase in [Ca2+]i that activates myosin light chain kinase, which initiates actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling and thus contraction ( Nelson et al., 1990 ). Negative feedback regulation of membrane depolarization and Ca2+ sparklet activation occurs through the activation of large-conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ ( BKCa ) channels as well as voltage-dependent KV2. 1 and KV1. 5/1. 2 K+ channels ( O’Dwyer et al., 2020; Amberg and Santana, 2006; Nelson et al., 1995; Plane et al., 2005 ). BKCa channels are organized into clusters along the sarcolemma of arterial myocytes ( Sato et al., 2019 ) and are activated by Ca2+ sparks resulting from the simultaneous opening of ryanodine receptors type 2 ( RyR2 ) located in a specialized junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) ( Nelson et al., 1995; Ledoux et al., 2006; Brayden and Nelson, 1992; Jaggar et al., 1998a; Knot et al., 1998b ). Because the input resistance of arterial myocytes is high ( Pucovský and Bolton, 2006; Yuan et al., 1993 ) ( about 2–10 GΩ ), even relatively small currents ( 10–30 pA ) produced by the activation of a small cluster ( Nelson et al., 1995; Jaggar et al., 1998b; Wang et al., 2004 ) of 6–12 BKCa channels by a Ca2+ spark can transiently hyperpolarize the membrane potential of these cells by 10–30 mV. Accordingly, decreases in BKCa, KV1. 2, KV1. 5, and/or KV2. 1 channels depolarize arterial myocytes, increasing CaV1. 2 channel activity, [Ca2+]i, and contraction of arterial smooth muscle ( Amberg and Santana, 2006; Zhong et al., 2010; Archer et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2002; Amberg et al., 2004 ). A recent study by O’Dwyer et al., 2020 suggested that KV2. 1 channels have dual conducting and structural roles in mesenteric artery smooth muscle with opposing functional consequences. Conductive KV2. 1 channels oppose vasoconstriction by inducing membrane hyperpolarization. Paradoxically, by promoting the structural clustering of the CaV1. 2 channel, KV2. 1 enhances Ca2+ influx and induces vasoconstriction. Interestingly, KV2. 1 protein is expressed to a larger extent in female than in male arterial smooth muscle. This induced larger CaV1. 2 clusters and activity in female than in male arterial myocytes. Here, we describe a new model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of mesenteric smooth muscle myocytes that incorporates new electrophysiological and Ca2+ signaling data suggesting key sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential as well as local and global [Ca2+]i signaling in male and female myocytes. The Hernandez–Hernandez model predicts that KV2. 1 channels play a primary role in the regulation of membrane potential in female myocytes, while KV.5 channels are dominant in male myocytes. The model also predicts sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability due to the gating of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2 channels. Furthermore, the model suggests that female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. We extended our investigation to include a one-dimensional (1 ) representation of tissue to simulate the effects of Ca2 channel blockers within an idealized mesenteric vessel. This framework can be expanded to predict the consequences of antihypertensive drugs and other perturbations transitioning from single-cell to tissue-level simulations. The Hernandez–Hern model represents the first integration of sex-specific variations in voltage-gated KV.1 and Ca1.2 channels enabling the prediction of sex disparities in membrane potential and regulation of Ca+ signaling in smooth muscle from systemic arteries.

    Title: 
    Article: Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes. 
 Litter decomposition is a key process determining elemental cycling in terrestrial ecosystems ( Schlesinger and Bernhardt, 2020 ). Decomposition is controlled by climate, litter quality, and origin, and the identity and abundance of microbial and faunal decomposers ( Bradford et al., 2016; Joly et al., 2023; Swift et al., 1979 ). Climate regulates decomposition rates directly, but also indirectly by influencing food-web structure and dynamics ( Wu et al., 2021 ). Thus, understanding how climate and decomposers interact is a key step in explaining variation in plant litter decomposition across ecosystems and seasons, and in forecasting the consequences of climate change and biodiversity loss on elemental cycling. Theory suggests that decomposition is positively associated with moisture and temperature ( Swift et al., 1979 ). Cross-site studies, reviews, and meta-analyses verified this global pattern, showing that plant litter decomposition in microbial litter bags is indeed faster under warm and wet conditions than under cool and dry conditions ( Berg et al., 1993; Meentemeyer, 1978; Bradford et al., 2017; Parton et al., 2007; Aerts, 1997; Zhang et al., 2008 ). This well accepted realization implicitly assumes that microorganisms dominate plant litter decomposition, largely ignoring the growing recognition that animals may play an important role in litter cycling. This role includes mineralizing and excreting assimilated plant nutrients, fragmenting and partly decomposing plant material, and transporting detritus to microbial havens ( David, 2014; Frouz, 2018; Griffiths et al., 2021; Auclerc et al., 2022; Sagi et al., 2021; Coulis et al., 2016; Joly et al., 2018; Joly et al., 2020 ). Attempts to explore how climate affects faunal decomposition revealed a similar positive association with temperature and precipitation ( García-Palacios et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2020 ). This global pattern, however, may be confounded by compiling the effect of all decomposer fauna together, ignoring the well-established understanding that soil animals of various size groups respond differently to climate ( Swift et al., 1979; Johnston and Sibly, 2020 ). Specifically, larger arthropods can survive and remain active during hot and dry periods when smaller organisms cannot ( Cloudsley-Thompson, 1975 ). Indeed, handful of evidence shows that macro-detritivorous arthropods dominate litter and wood decomposition in warm drylands, especially during warm and dry seasons ( Veldhuis et al., 2017; Sagi et al., 2019; Zanne et al., 2022 ). This suggests that the conceptualization of how animals and climate interact to regulate decomposition rates requires considering the effects of meso-decomposers and those of macro-decomposers separately, particularly in warm drylands. Detritivorous animals are expected to be exceptionally abundant in arid ecosystems where plant detritus is prevalent year-round but green plant material is available predominantly in short pulses following precipitation events ( Ayal et al., 2005 ). Macrofauna are physiologically and morphologically more adapted to aridity than mesofauna ( Cloudsley-Thompson, 1975 ). Moreover, their large size enables them to remain active during long dry periods by shuttling between existing and self-engineered climatic havens and the hostile foraging grounds on the surface ( Sagi and Hawlena, 2021 ). Consequently, macro-decomposition should be especially important in hot moisture-deprived habitats and periods, whereas the activity of microbes and mesofauna is expected to be minimal. The predicted negative association between moisture and macro-decomposition in drylands may be reversed in hyper-arid environments. In these environments, the extreme climatic conditions and scarce and unpredictable plant litter availability may limit macro-decomposer populations, diminishing macro-decomposition rates with increasing aridity. Consequently, and in sharp contrast to smaller organisms, macro-decomposition should follow a hump-shaped response to precipitation that peaks in arid ecosystems ( Figure 1 ). To test this novel hypothesis, we examined the climate dependency of plant litter decomposition by microorganisms, meso-decomposers, and macro-decomposers along a sharp aridity gradient spanning from mean annual precipitation ( MAP ) of 22–526 mm. This gradient represents hyper-arid, arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid Mediterranean climates ( Table 1, Figure 2A ). We repeated the experiment during hot summer with no precipitation and again during cooler and wetter winter. We hypothesized that both microbial and mesofaunal decomposition should increase with increasing precipitation during the winter, but during the dry summer contribute only minimally to plant litter decomposition across the aridity gradient. In the dry summer, macrofaunal decomposition should follow a hump-shaped response to precipitation, increasing from hyper-arid to arid sites and decreasing gradually in more mesic semiarid and Mediterranean sites. We also predicted that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across the precipitation gradient except in the hyper-arid sites in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size ( Figure 1 ). To reveal the mechanism, we sampled macro-decomposers across the aridity gradient and the two seasons, using pitfall traps. We predicted hump-shaped relationships between precipitation and the abundance, richness, and biomass of macro-decomposers that peak in arid ecosystems. 
 Litter removal rate differed across seasons, sites, and mesh sizes, and all interactions between these factors were found significant as well ( Figure 3, Table 2 ). On average, the litter removal rate was 2. 6-fold higher in winter than in summer, 1. 6-fold higher in meso- than in micro-baskets, and 1. 3-fold higher in macro- than in meso-baskets. Litter removal was negligible in the hyper-arid sites during both seasons, while it was highest in the arid sites during summer and in the more mesic sites during winter ( Figure 3 ). Within site and season comparisons between mesh sizes yielded significant differences only in Avdat, Sayeret Shaked, and Havat Shikmim, indicating that faunal effects on decomposition were found only under arid to dry-semiarid conditions ( Figure 3 ). Both macro- and mesofaunal effects were detected in the arid sites ( Avdat and Sayeret Shaked ), whereas the semiarid Havat Shikmim site exhibited only a mesofaunal effect during both seasons ( Figure 3 ). The macrofaunal, mesofaunal, and microorganismal contributions to litter mass loss peaked under arid, semiarid and Mediterranean climate conditions, respectively ( Figure 4 ). Whole-community litter removal rates were dictated by microorganisms in winter and by macrofauna in summer, resulting in comparable rates across the aridity gradient from Mediterranean to arid climate at the annual scale ( Figure 4 ). In total, the whole-community litter removal rate peaked in Sayeret Shaked ( MAP = 148 mm ) and significantly decreased under drier and wetter conditions ( Figure 4 ). Macro-decomposer abundance, biomass, and morphospecies richness peaked in the arid sites during both seasons ( Figure 5 ). The macro-decomposer assemblage differed significantly across sites ( F6, 229 = 10. 6, p-value <0. 001 ) and across seasons ( F1, 229 = 13. 1, p-value <0. 001 ), where woodlice, millipedes, and snails were substituted by ants and termites with increasing aridity ( Figure 6A, B ). Assemblage was significantly affected by the interaction between site and season too ( F6, 229 = 5. 4, p-value <0. 001 ). The experimental site explained much of the assemblage variability across traps ( R2 = 0. 18 ), whereas experimental season accounted for a smaller fraction ( R2 = 0. 04 ), and site–season interaction played an intermediate role ( R = 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    Title: 
    Article: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cyrib ( the gene encoding CYRI-B protein ) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis. 
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is highly metastatic with low survival rates and few treatment options. PDAC is thought to arise from precancerous non-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms ( PanINs ) classified as PanIN1–3 depending on the molecular and histological characteristics ( Hruban et al., 2001; Hruban et al., 2007 ). PanINs arise from acinar cells that undergo acinar to ductal metaplasia changes ( Wang et al., 2010 ) and as mutations accrue, PanINs progress to full PDAC in which angiogenesis, infiltration of stromal cells, and invasion of the basement membrane occur as tumours progress. Metastasis is a complex process and the current gold standard mouse model of metastatic PDAC - the KPC ( KRASG12D, p53R172H, Pdx-1-Cre ) ( Hingorani et al., 2005 ) recapitulates multiple features of the human disease ( Hwang et al., 2016 ). Cytoskeletal and migration-associated proteins have been associated with aggression and metastasis in PDAC both in human patient transcriptomes ( Bailey et al., 2016 ) and in the KPC mouse model ( Juin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014 ), suggesting avenues to pursue against metastatic spread. Downstream of active KRAS, hyperactivation of the small GTPase RAC1 drives proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling in PDAC and other cancers. Deletion of RAC1 in a KRAS-driven mouse model of PDAC delayed tumour onset, reduced PanIN lesions, and improved survival ( Heid et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014 ). This led to the conclusion that dysregulation of RAC1 control of epithelial polarity by active KRAS drives acinar to ductal metaplasia and accelerates tumourigenesis ( Heid et al., 2011 ). RAC1 regulates polarity and migration via Scar/WAVE-Arp2/3 control of actin dynamics at cell-cell contacts and at the cell leading edge. Additionally, coordinated RAC1 activation and deactivation are important in macropinocytosis, an actin-driven process whereby cells engulf extracellular substances via large cup-shaped protrusions of the plasma membrane ( Egami et al., 2014 ). Extracellular stimulation of cell surface receptors, such as tyrosine kinase or G-protein-coupled receptors, can trigger macropinocytosis via RAC1 and the Scar/WAVE complex ( Buckley and King, 2017 ). Tumours are frequently starved for amino acids and other nutrients and macropinocytosis is a major way for PDAC tumours to take up proteins, lipids, and cell debris from their environment ( Commisso et al., 2013; Hobbs and Der, 2022; Kamphorst et al., 2015; Puccini et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2019 ). Macropinocytosis also provides cells with a mechanism for internalisation of signalling receptors ( Clayton and Cousin, 2009; Le et al., 2021; Stow et al., 2020 ), but whether this has consequences for tumour progression is unknown. Metastasis is a complex process, involving cells breaching through tissue barriers, migrating and settling in distant sites in the body such as the liver, lungs, and peritoneal cavity ( Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020 ). Chemotaxis is thought to be a key driver of metastasis and pancreatic cancer cells migrate towards lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) both in vitro and in vivo, contributing to metastasis ( Juin et al., 2019; Papalazarou et al., 2020 ). LPA is a serum-derived chemotactic factor and was previously found to be consumed by melanoma and PDAC cells creating self-generated gradients contributing to metastasis ( Juin et al., 2019; Muinonen-Martin et al., 2010 ). Recently, the CYRI-B protein ( Cyfip-related RAC1-interacting protein B, formerly known as Fam49-B ) was discovered to interact with RAC1 and enhance leading edge actin dynamics by negatively regulating activation of the Scar/WAVE complex ( Fort et al., 2018 ). Scar/WAVE is a pentameric complex that interacts with both RAC1 and Arp2/3 complex and triggers actin assembly in lamellipodia ( Insall and Machesky, 2009 ). Depletion of CYRI-B in cultured cells enhanced lamellipodia stability, but did not impair migration speed ( Fort et al., 2018 ). CYRI proteins also play an important role in macropinocytosis, via the RAC1-Scar/WAVE pathway ( Le et al., 2021 ). These roles, along with the previous implication of RAC1 signalling in early and later stages of PDAC ( Heid et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014 ), suggested potential involvement of CYRI in invasion and metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that CYRI-B is highly expressed in PDAC and can contribute to PDAC development, progression, and metastasis. We discover a role for CYRI-B in signalling that drives proliferation in early lesions. Later, during metastasis, we find that CYRI-B is required for chemotaxis towards LPA, implicating macropinocytic uptake of LPAR1 in PDAC metastasis. Our study highlights CYRI-B as a potentially interesting new target in PDAC progression and metastasis and further elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning metastatic spread. 
 The Cyrib gene resides on human chromosome 8q24, near c-Myc, and is frequently amplified in many types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer ( Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020 ). High expression of CYRI-B correlates with poor outcome in many cancers ( Li et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022a ), including in human pancreatic cancer. To further investigate a potential role for Cyrib in pancreatic cancer, we first assessed the expression of CYRI-B in the KPC mouse model of metastatic PDAC ( Hingorani et al., 2005 ). In this model, PanIN develops by around 10 weeks and progresses to later stages towards 15 weeks, with full-blown PDAC appearing at this stage and mice reaching end-point with a half time of median 150–200 days. As we do not currently have a reliable antibody to detect CYRI-B protein in tissue samples, tissue samples from 6-, 10-, 15-week-old KPC mice were processed for RNA in situ hybridisation ( ISH ). At 6 weeks, before appearance of PanIN, Cyrib was not detected in the pancreas ( Figure 1 ). Cyrib expression was detectable by 10 weeks, especially around PanIN lesions, which remained stable until 15 weeks of age ( Figure 1 ). End-point tumours showed a significant increase in the levels of Cyrib ( Figure 1 ), suggesting that the KPC model was a good model for exploring the role of Cyrib expression during PDAC progression. To further probe the mechanism by which CYRI-B might influence PDAC progression, we crossed Cyrib floxed mice with KPC mice. We refer to these mice and cell lines derived from them as CKPC ( Figure 2A ). ISH of end-point tumours confirmed no detectable Cyrib mRNA in CKPC tumours in comparison with KPC ( Figure 2B and C ). Western blotting also confirmed absence of CYRI-B protein in cell lines derived from end-point CKPC mouse tumours ( CKPC-1 and CKPC-2 ) compared with a cell line from a KPC tumour ( KPC-1 ) ( Figure 2D ). To determine the effect of CY-B loss on PDAC progression, we monitored tumour growth and survival in CKPC mice ( Figure 3 ). CK tumours grew faster than KPC tumours ( Figure 3A ) and median survival was significantly shorter ( Figure 3B ), indicating that loss of CY-B accelerates tumourigenesis in PDAC. To investigate the role of CY-B in early stages of PDAC, we examined proliferation and ERK and JNK signalling in CKPC tumours ( Figure 4 ). CK tumours showed enhanced ERK and JNK activation ( Figure 4A and B ) and increased proliferation ( Figure 4C ) compared to KPC tumours. These results suggest that CY-B acts as a buffer against RAC hyperactivation in early stages PDAC. To determine the role of CY-B in metastasis, we examined chemotaxis of CK tumour cells towards LPA ( Figure 5 ). CK tum cells showed reduced chemotaxis towards LPA ( Figure 5 ) compared to K tumour cells ( Figure 5 ), indicating that CY-B is required for chemaxis towards LPA in PDAC metastasis. We also examined macinocytic uptake of LPAR1 in CK cells ( Figure 6 ) and found reduced uptake in CK cells ( Figure 6 ) compared to K cells ( Figure 6 ), suggesting that CY-B is required for macinocytic uptake of LPAR in PDAC metastasis. Overall, our results indicate that CY-B plays a role in PD progression and metastasis, acting as a buffer against RAC hyperactivation in early stages and required for chemaxis towards LPA in metastasis.

    Title: 
    Article: HERV-K ( HML-2 ), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ), indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism. 
 Retroviruses ( Retroviridae ) are a major family of animal viruses, including human viruses capable of causing severe immunodeficiency ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) or cancer ( HTLV-1 ) ( Chermann et al., 1983; Gallo et al., 1984; Guyader et al., 1987; Jern and Coffin, 2008; Poiesz et al., 1980 ). Uniquely among animal viruses, they must irreversibly integrate their genome into the host genome in order to replicate ( Brown, 1997; Hughes et al., 1978 ). If an infected cell survives, the integrated viral genome, or provirus, will be stably inherited by daughter cells; if a germline cell is infected, the provirus may be inherited by an offspring of the host organism as a heterozygous allele, which may eventually become fixed in the descendant population ( Stoye, 2012 ). Such proviruses and remnants of such proviruses, known as endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs ), form a major fraction of most eukaryotic genomes; in humans, ~8% of the genome is composed of such sequences ( Griffiths, 2001 ). These sequences serve as a useful ‘fossil record’ of past viral infections, and can also play important roles in genome evolution, host–viral interactions, and disease; in some animals, such as mice and cats, reactivation and recombination of ERVs with exogenous viruses and/or other ERVs can have severe pathogenic consequences ( Bamunusinghe et al., 2017; Bolin and Levy, 2011; Johnson, 2019; Young et al., 2012 ). No replication competent human ERV ( HERV ) has been identified; however, the betaretrovirus-like HERV-K group contains one subgroup, human MMTV-like-2, or HML-2 ( named for its similarity to mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) ), which includes many proviruses with full-length open reading frames ( ORFs ) and other intact functional elements, including two proviruses with full-length ORFs for the four core retroviral proteins Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env ( Boller et al., 2008; Hanke et al., 2016; Subramanian et al., 2011; Wildschutte et al., 2016 ). The majority of HML-2 proviruses containing full-length ORFs are within the LTR5Hs subclade, which is the youngest HERV clade and contains many human specific and insertionally polymorphic proviruses that have not yet reached fixation in human populations ( Subramanian et al., 2011; Wildschutte et al., 2016 ). Although none of these proviruses are replication competent, two groups have shown that a synthetic consensus young HML-2 provirus is weakly replication competent, and expression of HML-2 RNA and proteins has been observed in a number of different diseases ( Dewannieux et al., 2006; Garcia-Montojo et al., 2018; Goering et al., 2015; Hanke et al., 2016; Magiorkinis et al., 2013; Schmitt et al., 2013; Wang-Johanning et al., 2014; Lee and Bieniasz, 2007 ). The oldest known human HML-2 proviruses have orthologous insertions in both apes and Old World monkeys ( OWM ), indicating that the clade originated in the common ancestor of the catarrhine primates ( Bannert and Kurth, 2006 ). However, much less is known about the evolutionary history and extent of HML-2 activity in non-human primates than in humans. A recent study reported that HML-2 has more recently been actively replicating in gorillas than in humans, though it is still unclear whether that activity has continued to the present day; some chimpanzee-specific insertions have also been identified, although fewer than in humans or gorillas ( Holloway et al., 2019; Macfarlane and Badge, 2015 ). A 2007 study identified 19 HML-2 proviruses in rhesus macaques ( designated as ‘RhERV-K’ ), including three with almost identical long terminal repeats ( LTRs ), implying relatively recent integration ( Romano et al., 2007 ). More recently, another study identified several HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, detected expression of env mRNA, and identified one macaque with an Env-specific immune response ( Wu et al., 2016 ). One of the proviruses identified, which the authors named SERV-K1, has full-length ORFs for gag and env, and only two single nucleotide insertions disrupting the pro and pol ORFs. SERV-K1 is not present in the rhesus reference genome, indicating that it is insertionally polymorphic, and its 5′ and 3′ LTRs are identical in sequence. Both of these characteristics indicate that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion ( less than about 500, 000 years old ), and suggests that rhesus macaques could possibly harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses. Lastly, a recent study identified SERV-K1-like proviruses in a number of OWM species, including multiple macaque species, geladas, and olive baboons; this study also reported that many of these proviruses had very similar LTRs, suggestive of recent integration ( van der Kuyl, 2021 ). Overall, these studies indicate the potential for recent HML-2 activity in multiple catarrhine primate species, including rhesus macaques. Thus, a comprehensive characterization of HML-2 proviruses in the rhesus macaque reference genome would provide a valuable starting point for further investigations of this potential. In order to investigate the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques, we searched for HML-2 proviral sequences in the two most recent rhesus genome assemblies and performed an in-depth characterization of their structure, coding capacity, and evolutionary history, with a particular focus on SERV-K1-like proviruses. We have found that SERV-K1 is part of a large clade of rhesus proviruses that show signs of recent activity. Furthermore, this clade originated as an ancient recombinant between an HML-2-like virus and another retrovirus in the HERVK11 ( HML-8 ) clade. The recombinant retrovirus has also undergone at least one interspecies transmission event, from OWM to gibbons. Lastly, we have discovered that the region derived from the recombination with HML-8 functions as a novel constitutive RNA transport element, capable of facilitating export of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNA from the nucleus. 
 SERV-K1 is closely related to human HML-2, with Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env having 79, 90, 90, and 82% amino acid identity to the proteins of the consensus human HML-2 provirus HERV-Kcon ( Lee and Bieniasz, 2007 ), respectively; however, we also noticed some major structural differences ( Figure 1A ). The LTRs are significantly reduced in length compared to human H-2 proviruses, and the 3′ LTR has a deletion in the Response Element (RE ) required for nuclear export of unspliced RNA. The 5′ LTR has a deletion in the polyadenylation signal ( polyA ) and the 3′ LTR has a deletion in the polyadenylation signal ( polyA ). The 5′ LTR also has a deletion in the polyadenylation signal ( poly ) and the 3 LTR has a deletion in the polyadenylation ( poly ). The 5′ LTR has a deletion in the polyadenylation ( poly ) and the 3 LTR has deletion in the polyadenylation ( poly. The 5′ LTR has a deletion in polyadenylation ( poly and the 3 LTR has deletion in polyaden ( poly. The 5′ LTR has a deletion polyaden ( poly and the 3 L has deletion polyaden ( poly. The 5 LTR has deletion polyaden poly and the 3 has deletion polyaden poly. The 5 L has deletion polyaden poly and the 3 has polyaden poly. The 5 L has polyaden poly and the 3 has polyaden.

    Title: 
    Article: Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enterococcus faecalis is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23, 000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections. 
 Infections pose a challenge to the wound healing process, affecting both the skin’s protective barrier and the efficient repair mechanisms required for tissue integrity. The skin, the largest and most intricate defense system in mammals, exhibits unique cellular heterogeneity and complexity that maintain tissue homeostasis. Within the skin, undifferentiated resident cells are the main modulators of tissue maintenance, albeit terminal differentiation dynamics adapt to the regenerative requirements of the tissue. Several comprehensive studies conducted in mice and humans have highlighted the complexity of the skin ( Cheng et al., 2018; Der et al., 2019; Joost et al., 2020; Joost et al., 2018; Joost et al., 2016; Philippeos et al., 2018; Theocharidis et al., 2022 ). However, these studies have primarily focused on cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptome of intact skin or uninfected wounds, offering limited insights into the dynamics of wound healing following infection. Efficient healing during wound infections involves a sequence of events occurring in three distinct but interconnected stages: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling ( Eming et al., 2014; Masson-Meyers et al., 2020; Minutti et al., 2017; Rognoni and Watt, 2018 ). These events involve a series of inter- and intracellular molecular interactions mediated by soluble ligands and the innate immune system ( Lindley et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018 ). The inflammatory phase initiates migration of leukocytes into the wound site to help clear cell debris and establish tissue protection through local inflammation. Initially, neutrophils, responding to pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, extravasate through the endothelium to the site of injury. Subsequently, the proliferative stage aims to reduce wound size through contraction and re-establishment of the epithelial barrier. This stage is facilitated by activated keratinocytes modulated by inflammatory responses, cytokines, and growth factors. In the final stage, tissue remodeling restores the mechanical properties of intact skin through ECM reorganization, degradation, and synthesis ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Dysregulation of this intricate mechanism can lead to pathological outcomes characterized by persistent inflammation and excessive ECM production ( Ashcroft et al., 2013 ). Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal bacterium in the human gut, and also an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infections, including surgical site infections and diabetic ulcers ( Kao and Kline, 2019 ). Bacterial wound infections in general, including those associated with E. faecalis, are biofilm-associated, resulting in an antibiotic-tolerant population that may lead to persistent infections ( Ch’ng et al., 2019 ). Additionally, E. faecalis has mechanisms to evade and suppress immune clearance by, for example, suppressing the pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype in macrophage and preventing neutrophil extracellular trap formation ( Kao et al., 2023; Kao and Kline, 2019; Tien et al., 2017 ). E. faecalis can also persist ( Bertuccini et al., 2002; Gentry-Weeks et al., 1999; Horsley et al., 2018; Horsley et al., 2013; Olmsted et al., 1994; Wells et al., 1990; Wells et al., 1988; Zou and Shankar, 2014; Zou and Shankar, 2016 ) and replicate ( da Silva et al., 2022; Nunez et al., 2022 ) within epithelial cells and macrophages, further complicating treatment. The combination of biofilm formation and immune evasion makes Enterococcal wound infections a significant clinical challenge. In a murine full-thickness excisional wound model, our prior investigations revealed a bifurcated trajectory characterizing E. faecalis wound infections ( Chong et al., 2017 ). Initially, bacterial colony-forming units ( CFU ) increase in number in the acute replication phase, with a concomitant pro-inflammatory response characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production coupled with neutrophil infiltration. In the subsequent persistence stage, E. faecalis CFU undergo gradual reduction and stabilization at approximately 105 CFU within wounds by 2–3 day post-infection ( dpi ), coinciding with delayed wound healing. Within this framework, we have identified specific bacterial determinants that contribute to each phase of E. faecalis infection. For example, de novo purine biosynthesis emerges as a pivotal factor in enhancing bacterial fitness during the acute replication phase ( Tan et al., 2022 ). In the persistent phase at 3 dpi, the galactose and mannose uptake systems, in conjunction with the mprF gene product, are associated with nutrient acquisition and resistance to antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil-mediated killing, respectively ( Bao et al., 2012; Chong et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2021; Kandaswamy et al., 2013; Rashid et al., 2023 ). Nonetheless, the intricate interplay between these E. faecalis persistence-associated virulence factors, their immunomodulatory evasion strategies, and precise implications in the context of delayed wound healing remains to be investigated. To address this, we generated a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the host response to persistent E. faecalis wound infection. We observed that E. faecalis induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in keratinocytes. Moreover, macrophages in infected wounds displayed M2-like polarization. Our findings also indicate that the interactions between macrophages and endothelial cells contribute to the anti-inflammatory niche during infection. Furthermore, E. faecalis-infected macrophages drive pathogenic vascularization signatures in endothelial cells, resembling the tumor microenvironment in cancer. We also noted E. faecalis infected-associated macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, regulating chemokine signaling pathways and promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. These insights from our scRNA-seq atlas provide a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing. 
 In the wound environment, various cell types, including myeloid cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, play critical roles in the initial and later stages of wound healing by releasing platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ). Additionally, macrophages secrete epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) in injured skin, which operates through the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) to promote keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and re-epithelialization. To understand the impact of E. faecalis infection on wound healing, we infected excisional dorsal wounds on C57BL/6J male mice and measured gene expression levels of wound healing markers in bulk tissue at 4 dpi at the onset of persistent infection. We then compared the expression profiles with those of ( i ) wounded but uninfected or ( ii ) unwounded and uninfected controls, ensuring that the uninfected and infected mice were of comparable weight ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B ). We observed lower expression of platelet-derived growth factor subunit A ( Pdgfa ) in E. faecalis-infected wounds than in unwounded skin, while uninfected wounds remained unchanged. Similarly, the expression of Egf was lower in uninfected wounds than in healthy uninf wounds, but higher in E faalis-infected wounds compared to uninf wounds ( Figure 1B ). These results suggest that E faalis infection modulates the wound healing process by altering the expression of key growth factors involved in reepithelialization and proliferation. To investigate the cellular response to E faalis infection, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected and uninf wounds at 4 dpi. We analyzed over 23, 000 cells and generated a comprehensive atlas of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of wounds ( Figure 2, Figure 2— supplement 1 ). Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing. We identified dysregulated keratin and fibro transcriptomes in response to infection, contributing an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E faalis infection prompted premature EMT in keratinocytes. Furthermore, fa infection modulated M2-like macroage polarization inhibiting pro-inflammatory in vitro in vivo and scRNA-seq. We also discovered macroage cros with neutils regulating chemine pathways promoting anti-inflammatory with endothelial. Overall, our findings offer insights into immunosuppressive role fa in wound infections.

    Title: 
    Article: Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ), however, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence. 
 Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount appropriate responses to herbivores ( Waterman et al., 2019; Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023 ). Among these cues are herbivore-induced plant volatiles ( HIPVs ) ( Meents and Mithöfer, 2020; Karban, 2021 ). When perceived by undamaged plants, HIPVs can enhance plant defenses, and thus increase plant resistance to future herbivory ( Erb et al., 2015; Kalske et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Engelberth et al., 2004; Vázquez-González et al., 2023 ). HIPVs can directly induce plant defenses ( Hu et al., 2019; Engelberth et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2023; Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005 ). HIPVs can also prime plant defenses. In this case, HIPV-exposed plants respond more strongly and/or more rapidly to a secondary stimulus such as herbivore attack ( Erb et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2019; Engelberth et al., 2004; Mauch-Mani et al., 2017 ). Plant responses to environmental cues depend on temporal patterns. For example, artificial herbivory that mimics spatiotemporal patterns of chewing herbivores induces more a similar response to actual herbivore attack than when spatiotemporal patterns are ignored ( Mithöfer et al., 2005 ). The emission of HIPVs also follows discrete temporal dynamics ( Erb et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017 ), which, again, is likely to influence defense responses in receiver plants. Green leaf volatiles ( GLVs ), including ( Z ) -3-hexenyl acetate ( HAC ), ( Z ) -3-hexenal, and ( Z ) -3-hexen-1-ol, are catabolic products of the lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase pathway and are emitted within minutes following damage ( D’Auria et al., 2007; Matsui, 2006 ). Indole and terpenes are emitted within hours of herbivore attack ( Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023; Erb et al., 2015 ). Indole can mediate interactions between plants as well as between plants and other organisms ( Ye et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2018; Veyrat et al., 2016 ). Terpenes are a very diverse group of volatiles ( >80, 000 known structures ) that are also important as both direct and indirect plant defenses ( Kalske et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021; Zhou and Pichersky, 2020; Riedlmeier et al., 2017 ). Indole and terpenes take longer to produce in comparison to GLVs and are less transiently emitted ( Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023; Erb et al., 2015; D’Auria et al., 2007 ). In maize, GLVs have been implicated in direct induction ( Engelberth et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2023 ), and both GLVs and indole are known to prime defenses, and are thus considered as ‘bioactive’ in information transfer between plants ( Erb et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2019 ). Although it is clear that plants can either be primed or directly induced following HIPV exposure, if and how these two phenomena integrate in the context of a natural HIPV exposure sequence is unclear. Studies have yet to monitor induction and priming dynamics in real time and during continuous exposure to HIPVs. It is possible that, through time, continuous HIPV exposure may result in a self-enforced positive feedback loop, whereby priming enhances induction and induction serves as a priming event for subsequent induction. Further, temporal trends might be complicated by dynamic environmental conditions, such as light fluctuations; over a 24 hr period, plants can experience both full sun and darkness. In darkness, the emission of many volatiles, especially those released via stomata, is severely hindered ( Seidl-Adams et al., 2015; He et al., 2021; Bläsing et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2022 ). In order to understand the kinetics of information transfer between plants and the importance of dynamic temporal emission patterns, we monitored the emission kinetics of terpenes as a marker of defense activation in maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs. We leveraged a highly temporally resolved volatile multiplexing system that allowed us to track continuous volatile emissions in sender and receiver plants for the first time in real time. We further measured foliar terpene pools, stress hormones, and defense gene expression in receiver plants, and determined the impact of day:night light transitions in the observed defense induction kinetics. Finally, we measured defenses upon sequences of short-term HIPV and GLV exposure to unravel the relative importance of direct induction and priming. Together, our experiments reveal how the natural kinetics of herbivore attack result in a clocked defense response in neighboring plants via volatile information transfer. 
 When maize plants are exposed to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbors, they start to release terpenes ( Hu et al., 2019; Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005 ). To understand the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon, we conducted a detailed time-course analysis of terpene release by receiver plants exposed to volatiles from sender plants under attack by Spodoptera exigua caterpillars ( Figure 1 ). Herbivore feeding began around 12:00 and within 3 hr, we detected a small induction of sesquiterpenes [C15H25+, m/z=205. 20], monoterpenes [C10H17+, m/z=137. 13], 4, 8-dimethylnona-1, 3, 7-triene ( DMNT ) [C11H19+, m/z=151. 15], and 4, 8, 12-trimethyltrideca-1, 3, 7, 11-tetraene ( TMTT ) [C16H27+, m/z=219. 21] in undamaged receiver plants. Volatile emission was severely impaired during the night, regardless of treatment. Interestingly, as soon as the light was restored, we observed a strong burst of terpene release from receiver plants, which was two to five times higher than the release the day before ( Figure 1 ). Thus, exposure to volatiles from a herbivore-attacked plant triggers a delayed burst in terpene emission in neighboring plants. Why do receiver plants show a delayed burst in volatile-induced terpenoid release? During the night, plants close their stomata to limit water loss ( Caird et al., 2007 ), which may also impair terpene release, thus leading to an accumulation of terpenes in the leaves and a burst once stomata open again ( Seidl-Adams et al., 2015; Loughrin et al., 1994 ). To determine if terpenes accumulate above daytime levels in maize leaves of HIPV-exposed plants during the night, we measured internal foliar pools of the sesquiterpenes, β-caryophyllene, β-farnesene, and α-bergamotene, as well as the homoterpene, TMTT, over time. Internal pools of β-caryophyllene, β-farnesene, and TMT did not increase during the night ( Figure 2 ), indicating that the delayed burst is not due to accumulation of teres during the night. However, we observed a significant increase in jasmonic acid (JA ) levels in receiver plants exposed to HIP ( Figure 3 ), which coincides with the delayed burst of terene release ( Figure 1 ). JA is a key stress hormone involved in plant defense against herbivory ( Turner et al. 2002 ) and has been shown to induce terp production ( Hu et al,201; Ruther and Fürau 2005 ). Thus, the delayed burst of terene in receiver plants exposed to volat from herbiv-att plants is likely due to JA accumulation during the night. We tested whether the delayed response is independent of day:night transitions by exposing plants to volat from herbiv-att under constant light or darkness. Plants exposed to volat from herbivatt under constant light showed the same delayed terene release as those exposed to lightdark ( Figure 4 ), indicating that the response is independent of day:night transitions. We also tested whether the delayed response is due to sender dynamics by exposing plants to volat from herbivatt at different times of the day. Plants exposed to volat from herbiv in the morning or afternoon showed the same delayed ter release as those exposed to volat in the evening ( Figure 5 ), indicating that the response is not due to sender dynamics. The delayed response to volat from herbiv-att is likely due to a memory from exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volat on the second day. To test this, we exposed plants to vol from herbiv in the morning and measured terene release the next day. Plants exposed to vol from herb in the morning showed a delayed release of terene the next day ( Figure 6 ), indicating that the response is due to a memory from the first exposure. Our results show that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volat results in a response that integrates priming and induction into a distinct and predictable pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question whether volat predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants by revealing they can both in sequence. Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount responses to herbiv ( Water et al,2019; Escobar-Bravo et,202 ) Among these cues are herbore plant volat (HIPs ) ( Me and Mithfer,202; Kar,202 ) When perceived undamaged, HIP can enhance plant defenses and increase resistance to herbory ( Er et al,201; Kke et al,2019; Hu et,201; Engelth et,2004; Vquez-Gonz et,202 ) HIP can directly induce defenses ( et al,201; Engelth,200; Wang et,202; R and Fürsten,2005 ) HIP can also prime defenses In this, HIP-exposed plants respond strongly/or rapidly to a stimulus such as herbore attack ( et,201; et, Engel,200; Ma-Mani et, ) Plant responses depend on temporal patterns For example, herbory mimics spatiemporal patterns chewingores more similar to actual attack when spemp patterns ignored ( Mfer et,200 ) emission HIP also follows discrete dynamics ( et,201; et ) which likely influence responses in plants Green volat (GL ) including Z-henyl acetate H, Z-henal, Z-hen-ol are catab products lipoxygen/hperoxide lyase pathway emitted minutes following damage (A et,200; Mats, ) Indole teres emitted hours herbore ( Esc-Bravo et202; et201 ) Ind mediate interactions plants organisms ( et202; et Ye et Ye et ) Teres diverse group vol > known structures important direct indirect defenses (ke et201; Chen et ; Zhou Pich

    Title: 
    Article: Recursive procedures that allow placing a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind provide a neuro-computational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and human song. There are, however, no known vocal sequences among nonhuman primates arranged in self-embedded patterns that evince vocal recursion or potential incipient or evolutionary transitional forms thereof, suggesting a neuro-cognitive transformation exclusive to humans. Here, we uncover that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. Remarkably, three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples, which suggests that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances. Findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. Second-order combinatorics, ‘sequences within sequences’, involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. 
 A novel, direct approach to recursive vocal combinatorics in wild primates is desirable to help infer signal patterns that were recursive in some degree or kind in an extinct past, and molded subsequently into the recursive structures observed today in humans. By virtue of their own primitive nature, proto-recursive structures did not likely fall within modern-day classifications. Therefore, they will often fail to be predicted based on assumptions guided by modern language ( Kershenbaum et al., 2014; Miyagawa, 2021 ). To this end, a structural approach is particularly advantageous based on the cross-disciplinary definition of recursion as ‘the nesting of an element or pattern within a self-similar element or pattern’. First, no prior assumptions are required about species’ cognitive capacities. High-level neuro-motor procedures are inferred only to the extent that these are directly reflected in how signal sequences are organized. For example, Chomsky’s definition of recursion ( Chomsky, 2010 ) can generate non-self-embedded signal structures, but these would be for that same reason operationally undetectable amongst other signal combinations. Second, no prior assumptions are required about signal meaning. There are no certain parallels between semantic content and word meaning in animals, but analyses of signal patterning allow us to identify the similarities between non-semantic ( nonhuman ) and semantic ( human ) combinatoric systems ( Lipkind et al., 2013; Sainburg et al., 2019 ). The search for recursion can, hence, be made in the absence of lexical items, semantics, or syntax. Third, no prior assumptions are required about signal function. Under any evolutionary scenario, including punctuated hypotheses, ancestral signal function ( whether cooperative, competitive, or otherwise ) is expected to have derived or been leveraged by its proto-recursive structure. Otherwise, once present, recursion would not have been fixated among human ancestral populations. Accordingly, a structural approach opens the field to potentially untapped signal diversity in nature and yet unrecognized bona fide combinatoric possibilities within the human clade. Here, we undertake an explorative but direct structural approach to recursion. We provide evidence for recursive self-embedded vocal patterning in a ( nonhuman ) great ape, namely, in the long calls of flanged orangutan males in the wild. We conducted precise rhythm analyses ( De Gregorio et al., 2021; Roeske et al., 2020 ) of 66 long call audio recordings produced by 10 orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii ) across approximately 2510 observation hours at Tuanan, Central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. We identified five different element types that comprise the structural building blocks of long calls in the wild ( Hardus et al., 2009; Lameira and Wich, 2008 ), of which the primary type are full pulses ( Figure 1A ). Full pulses do not, however, always exhibit uninterrupted vocal production throughout a long call ( as during a long call’s climax; Spillmann et al., 2010 ) but can break up into four different ‘sub-pulse’ element types: ( i ) grumble sub-pulses ( quick succession of staccato calls that typically constitute the first build-up pulses of long calls; Hardus et al., 2009 ), ( ii ) sub-pulse transitory elements and ( iii ) pulse bodies ( typically constituting pulses before and/or after climax pulses ), and ( iv ) bubble sub-pulses ( quick succession of staccato calls that typically constitute the last tail-off pulses of long calls ) ( Figure 1A ). We characterized long calls’ full- and sub-pulses’ rhythmicity to determine whether orangutan long calls present a reiterated structure across different hierarchical strata. We extracted inter-onset intervals ( IOIs; i. e., time difference between the start of a vocal element and the preceding one – tk ) from 8993 vocal long call elements ( Figure 1A ) : 1930 full pulses ( 1916 after filtering for 0. 025 < tk < 5 s ), 757 grumble sub-pulses ( 731 ), 1068 sub-pulse transitory elements ( 374 ), 816 pulse bodies ( 11 ), and 4422 bubble sub-pulses ( 4193 ). From the extracted IOIs, we calculated their rhythmic ratio by dividing each IOI by its duration plus the duration of the following interval. We then computed the distribution of these ratios to ascertain whether the rhythm of long call full and sub-pulses presented natural categories, following published protocols ( De Gregorio et al., 2021; Roeske et al., 2020; Figure 1B–D ). 
 The density probability function of orangutan full pulses showed one peak ( rk = 0. 493 ) in close vicinity to a theoretically pure isochronic rhythm, that is, full pulses were regularly paced at a 1:1 ratio, following a constant tempo along the long call ( Figure 1C ). Our model ( GLMM, full model vs null model: Chisq = 298. 2876, df = 7, p<0. 001; see Supplementary file 1 ) showed that pulse type, range of the curve ( on-off-isochrony ), and their interaction had a significant effect on the count of rk values. In particular, full pulses’ isochronous peak tested significant ( t. ratio = −15. 957, p<0. 0001 ), that is, the number of rk values falling inside the on-isochrony range was significantly higher than the number of rks falling inside the off-isochrony range ( Figure 1C ). Critically, three ( of the four ) orangutan sub-pulse element types – grumble sub-pulses, sub-pulse transitory elements, and bubble sub-pulses – also showed significant peaks ( grumble sub-pulses: t. ratio = –5. 940, p<0. 0001; sub-pulse transitory elements: t. ratio = −4. 048, p=0. 0001; bubble sub-pulses: t. ratio = –10. 640, p<0. 0001 ) around pure isochrony ( peak rk: grumble sub-pulses = 0. 501; sub-pulse transitory elements = 0. 495; bubble sub-pulses = 0. 502; Figure 1C ). That is, sub-pulses were regularly paced within regularly paced full pulses, denoting isochrony within isochrony ( Figure 1C ) at different average tempi [mean tk ( sd ) : full pulses = 1. 696 ( 0. 508 ) ; grumble sub-pulses = 0. 118 ( 0. 111 ) ; sub-pulse transitory elements = 0. 239 ( 0. 468 ) ; bubble sub-pulses = 0. 186 ( 0. 292 ) ; Figure 1B]. Overall, sub-pulses’ tk was equivalent to 0. 046 of their comprising full pulses ( Figure 1D ), which puts sub-pulses at an approximate ratio of 1:22 relative to that of full pulses, the smallest categorical temporal rhythmic interval registered thus far in a vertebrate ( De Gregorio et al., 2021; Roeske et al., 2020 ). Permuted discriminant function analyses ( Mundry and Sommer, 2007 ) ( crossed, in order to control for individual variation ) in R ( R Development Core Team, 2013 ) based on seven acoustic measures extracted from grumble, transitory elements, and bubble sub-pulses confirmed that these represented indeed acoustically distinct sub-pulse categories, where the percentage of correctly classified selected cases ( 62. 7% ) was significantly higher ( p=0. 001 ) than expected ( 37% ). 
 The observation that the long calls of wild orangutans possess isochronous characteristics raises questions about the ability of apes to perceive these signals. Humans perceive an acoustic pulse as a continuous pitch, not as a sequence of discrete elements ( Deacon, 1997 ). However, our results suggest that orangutans may be able to perceive isochron as a sequence of discrete elements, as evidenced by their ability to produce isochous sub-p sequences within isochous sub-p sequences ( Figure 1 ). We propose that orangutans may be able to perceive isoch as a sequence of discrete elements because they are able to produce isoch sub-p at different tempi ( Figure 1B ), which would not be possible if they perceived isoch as a continuous pitch. The ability to produce isoch sub at different tempi suggests that orangans may be able to perceive isoch as a sequence of elements that can be combined in different ways, which is a fundamental property of recursive combinatorial systems ( Chomsky,2010 ). The ability to produce isoch sub at different tem also suggests that orangans may be able to perceive isoch as a sequence of elements that can be nested within other sequences, which is a property of recursive combinator systems ( Chsky,2010 ). The ability to produce isoch at different tem also suggests that orangans may be able to perceive isoch as a sequence of elements that can be combined with other sequences, which is a property of combinatorial systems (sky,201 ). The ability to produceoch at different tem suggests that orangans may be able to perceiveoch as a sequence of elements that can be nested within other sequences, which is a property of recursive combinator systems (sky,201 ). The ability to produceoch at different tem suggests that orangans may be able to perceiveoch as a sequence of elements that can be combined with other, which is a property of combinator systems (sky,201 ) The ability to produceoch at tem suggests that orangans may be able to perceive as a sequence of elements that can be nested within other, which is a property of recursive systems (sky,201 ) The ability to produce at tem suggests orang may be able to perceive as a sequence of elements that can be combined, which is property of combinator (sky,201 ) The ability to produce at tem suggests orang may be able to perceive a sequence of elements that can be nested, which is property recursive (sky,201 ) The ability to produce tem orang may be able to perceive a sequence of elements that can be combined which is property combinator (,201 ) The ability to produce orang may be able to perceive a sequence that can be nested which is recursive (,201 ) The ability to orang may be able to perceive a sequence that can be combined is combinator (201 ) The ability orang may be able to perceive a sequence that can nested is recursive (201 ) The ability orang be able to perceive a sequence can be combinator (201 ) The orang be able to perceive sequence can recursive (201 ) The be able to perceive orang can comb (201 The be able orang can perceive (201 The able orang can be ( The be able orang The be ( be able The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The be The

    Title: 
    Article: The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. 
 The pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMP ) motifs, including proteins, lipids and nucleotides, resulting in activation of innate immune responses of host ( Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007 ). Retinoic-acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors ( RLRs ) are a specific group of PRRs belonging to the family of DExD/H-box RNA helicases, and they play a crucial role in the innate antiviral response. There are three members in the RLR family: retinoic-acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I ), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 ( MDA5 ), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( LGP2 ). RIG-I and MDA5 exhibit similar signaling characteristics and structural homology, including two N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains ( CARDs ), a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal repressor doma in ( RD ) ( Yoneyama et al., 2005 ). However, LGP2 lacks CARD domain ( Yoneyama et al., 2005 ). The specific roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to virus stimulation are not redundant: RIG-I detects short blunt-end RNA with a 5'-triphosphate motif ( 5’ppp-RNA ), while MDA5 specifically recognizes long forms of viral dsRNA ( Kato et al., 2006; Hornung et al., 2006; Loo and Gale, 2011 ). In contrast, the involvement of LGP2 in cytosolic RNA sensing remains a topic of debate. Some studies have proposed that LGP2 is crucial for the production of type I interferon ( IFN-I ) in response to several RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent viruses ( Satoh et al., 2010 ), whereas others have described LGP2 as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling ( Saito et al., 2007 ). However, surprisingly, despite the important immune functions of RLR members, they have been lost from the genome in many species including mammals, birds, and fish ( Xu et al., 2016; Liang and Su, 2021; Krchlíková et al., 2022 ). 5’ppp-RNA is present in a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families ( Hornung et al., 2006 ). These viruses widely infect all kinds of life and cause various harmfulness and serious diseases, and the infected hosts range from the highest vertebrates to the lowest vertebrate, teleost fish ( Millet et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2022 ). 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I. However, RIG-I is lacking in many vertebrates, so who then recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in these species? When a gene is functionally inactive or lost, other genes or pathways may undergo homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) to maintain organismal balance. The pressure from viral infections has led to the evolution of the immune system, and the loss of RIG-I may be accompanied by functional substitution by homologous genes in order to compensate for the loss of RIG-I function. Tupaia belangeri, a mammal lacking RIG-I, has been reported to possess the MDA5 protein, which has undergone positive selection and exhibits the ability to sense Sendai virus ( an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist ) for inducing type I IFN ( Xu et al., 2016 ). This study provides insights into the compensatory mechanism of RIG-I deficiency in vertebrates, however, considering the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics, further research is urgently needed to validate and expand these insights. For millions of years, viruses have coevolved with their hosts, leading to the development of various mechanisms for immune evasion in response to the mutual evolutionary pressure ( Naz et al., 2021 ). Recently, it is reported that N6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) modification plays a crucial role in enabling viruses to evade the interferon ( IFN ) response ( Lou et al., 2021 ). m6A methylation is an important epigenetic modification that involves the dynamic and reversible process of RNA methylation, regulated by methylase ( writer ), demethylase ( eraser ), and reader proteins that recognize m6A-modified RNA ( Shi et al., 2019 ). N6-methylation deposition on mRNA primarily relies on the enzymatic ‘writing’ complex within the cell, with a key composition featuring methyltransferase-like 3 ( METTL3 ) and METTL14. Conversely, N6-demethylation is chiefly modulated by ‘eraser’ proteins, with fat mass and obesity-associated protein ( FTO ) and AlkB homolog 5 ( ALKBH5 ) being the identified enzymes for this role ( Zheng et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2011 ). The functional impact of N6-methylation on RNA characteristics typically remains latent until recognition by ‘reader’ proteins, such as members of the YTHDF protein family, encompassing YTH domain family 1 ( YTHDF1 ), YTHDF2, and YTHDF3. In mammals, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 are recognized for their involvement in the degradation of m6A-modified RNA targets, as well as their association with mRNA localization and phase separation ( Wang et al., 2014 ). By utilizing these m6A-related enzymes in the host, viruses can not only use m6A modification to hide themselves and avoid recognition by host receptors but also manipulate host gene expression to enable immune evasion ( Zhang et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021 ). Fish and birds are commonly observed to exhibit ‘RIG-I deficiency’ phenomena, and they are also the most abundant groups of aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, giving them certain evolutionary advantages. As a result, the research of the immune evolution of them helps us to understand the immune evolution of the entire vertebrates. Meanwhile, fish and birds are major source of high-quality protein for human consumption, viral diseases in aquaculture and livestock industry pose serious obstacles to the industry’s healthy development. Among them, the 5’ppp-RNA virus, as mentioned earlier, is a highly pathogenic group. Within this group, siniperca cheats rhabdovirus ( SCRV ) is an important pathogen that can cause huge economic losses and serious threats to aquaculture in freshwater and marine fish ( Zhang and Gui, 2015 ). In addition, vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) is also a highly infectious and widely prevalent 5’ppp-RNA virus ( Walker et al., 2022 ). Therefore, in this study, we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker ( Miichthys miiuy ) and bird chicken ( Gallus gallus ), two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, as well as two 5'ppp-RNA viruses ( SCRV and VSV ), to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The final results demonstrated that the MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA. In addition, SCRV virus can in turn utilize the m6A strategy to degrade MDA5 of M. miiuy for immune evasion. In summary, these findings shed light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveil a complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of vertebrate. 
The article discusses the evolution of the arms race between viruses and hosts, specifically focusing on the interaction between the MDA receptor and 5'pp-R virus in lower vertebrates, such as Miichys mii and Gallus gallus, which lack the RIG receptor. The study suggests that MDA can replace RIG in recognizing 5'pp-R virus, leading to redundancy of RIG loss from the genome. However, 5pp-R virus can utilize m6 methylation to degrade MDA and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. The study provides insights into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.

    Title: 
    Article: Among its extragonadal effects, follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism. Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations, this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ), lean body mass ( LBM ), and bone fragility induced by ADT. The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters, bone mineral density ( BMD ), and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT. Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study. All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. FBM, LBM, and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. For outcome measurements and statistical analysis, t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated. At baseline conditions, a weak, non-significant, direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ). Conversely, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM ( r = 0. 52, p = 0. 006 ), fat mass at arms ( r = 0. 54, p = 0. 004 ), and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0. 45, p = 0. 018 ) assessed after 12 months. On the other hand, an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0. 64, p = 0. 001 ). This is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and this is the main limitation. FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, in particular on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. This research was partially funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals. The funder had no role in design and conduct of the study, collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data and in preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript. clinicalTrials. gov NCT03202381, EudraCT Number 2016-004210-10. 
 Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) exerts effects beyond those on gonadal tissue, which have been known for a long time ( Lizneva et al., 2019 ). In the animal model, FSH has been observed to stimulate osteoclastic activity and therefore to exert a negative role on bone mass ( Sun et al., 2006; Zaidi et al., 2023; Gera et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, FSH was found to have a positive action on adipocytes and the blockade of FSH induced by antibodies against FSH receptor caused an increase in bone mass and a reduction of body fat ( Liu et al., 2017; Rojekar et al., 2023 ). These preclinical data were confirmed in clinical studies. Large epidemiologic data have shown significant reductions in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and high resorption rates 2–3 years prior to menopause, when FSH serum levels are increasing, which is also associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity ( Thurston et al., 2009; Senapati et al., 2014 ). A longitudinal study involving post-menopausal women has shown that increases in circulating FSH levels were associated with greater increases in the percentage of total body fat, total body fat mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( Mattick et al., 2022 ). Moreover, clinical studies have found that FSH is also involved in the modulation of lean mass. A large cohort study of perimenopausal women showed that increased FSH concentrations were associated with increasing fat mass and decreasing lean mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis ( Sowers et al., 2007 ). Another recent prospective study showed that the indicators of sarcopenia were strongly associated with gonadotropins levels, especially in older men ( Guligowska et al., 2021 ). The impact of FSH on body composition may at least partially explain the observed correlation between FSH levels and the risk of cardiovascular events ( Munir et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2013; El Khoudary et al., 2016 ). Studies clarifying the relationship among FSH, body composition measures, and BMD in prostate cancer ( PC ) patients are lacking. Likewise, the interaction between the variation of FSH serum levels and the modification of these parameters in PC patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is not known. We recently conducted the BLADE study ( Bone mineraL mAss Dexa dEgarelix ), a prospective phase IV study designed to obtain explorative information on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measurement changes in lean body mass ( LBM ) and fat body mass ( FBM ) in patients with non-metastatic PC treated with degarelix, an LHRH ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) antagonist that has been developed to achieve effective long-term medical castration without the risk of testosterone surge and its associated flare. Data on changes in total LBM and FBM and on the impact of degarelix on BMD and bone turnover markers were recently published ( Palumbo et al., 2021; Palumbo et al., 2022 ). Here, we analyse the association of FSH with DXA-assessed FBM, LBM, and BMD and bone turnover markers at baseline and after degarelix administration in the patients enrolled in the BLADE study. 
 BLADE is a single-centre, prospective, interventional phase IV study ( clinicalTrials. gov NCT03202381, EudraCT Number 2016-004210-10 ) conducted at the Prostate Cancer Unit of the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale degli Spedali Civili and Università degli Studi of Brescia. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and Good Clinical Practices and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Brescia ( approval number NP2540 ). All patients provided a written informed consent. Male patients with histologically confirmed PC without bone metastasis at bone scintigraphy, judged eligible to ADT according to current guidelines recommendations ( Cornford et al., 2017; Mottet et al., 2017 ) after a multidisciplinary discussion, were enrolled ( Supplementary file 1 ). Eligibility criteria have been published elsewhere ( Palumbo et al., 2021 ). Degarelix was administered as a subcutaneous injection with a starting dose of 240 mg, followed by a maintenance dose of 80 mg every 28 days. After 12 months, treatment with degarelix was continued as clinically indicated. DXA measurements for assessing BMD and body composition parameters were performed at baseline and after 12 months, using Hologic QDR-4500W instrumentation ( Hologic Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts ). DXA measurements related to whole body DXA scans were extracted from Apex Software version 3. 4. The densitometric image of each patient was divided, following the manufacturer’s instructions, into different body districts, including arms, legs, trunk, head, and other derived regions, such as the android and gynoid zone. BMD, bone mineral content ( BMC ), fat free mass, and fat mass were assessed for every region of interest, where fat free mass was provided by the software in terms of lean soft tissue plus BMC. Despite the lean mass measured by DXA counts also skin, connective tissue, and some lean components within the adipose tissue ( Visser et al., 1999 ), it still correlates highly with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging measurements and represents a good approximation of the real muscle mass ( Buckinx et al., 2018 ). Other DXA-derived body composition parameters, such as fat mass index ( FM/H2 ) ( FMI ), appendicular lean mass index ( ALM/H2 ) ( ALMI ), and trunk/appendicular ratio, were then calculated to complete the analysis and the patient characterization. Blood chemistry and bone turnover markers: alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ( CTX ) were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. CTX serum levels were measured using the ElectroChemiLuminescenceAssay ( ECLIA ) kit Elecsys beta-CrossLaps/serum ( Roche Diagnostic, Germany ) using Cobas e411instruments ( Roche ) ; normal ranges were <0. 704 ng/ml ( men of the age between 50 and 70 ), <0. 5 ng /ml ( men > 70 ). ALP serum was measured using the colorimetric method ( Roche ) with normal range 10–45 IU /L. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4. 1.2 (R Core Team 2021 ). Continuous variables were compared using t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test when appropriate. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between variables. The study was funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals and had no role in the design, conduct, collection, management, analysis, interpretation of data, preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript. clinicalTrials. gov NCT03281, EudCT Number 201-004-10. 
The study included 29 consecutive patients with non-metastatic PC treated with degare from 2017 to 2019. Baseline and 12-month measurements of body composition and BMD were assessed by DXA.

**Title:** Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Body Composition Changes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy (AD)

**Background:** Folle-stimulating hormone (FS) has been known to have effects beyond gonadal effects, including impacts on bone and body composition. Androgen deprivation therapy (AD) affects FSH levels, which may contribute to changes in body mass, lean mass, and bone fragility. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FSH levels and body composition, bone density, and turnover in prostate cancer (PC) patients undergoing AD.

**Methods:** 29 nonmetastatic PC patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019. Luteizing hormone-releasing antagonist degare was administered. Body mass, lean mass, and bone density were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal peptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months.

**Results:** At baseline, a weak, non-significant relationship was found between FSH and body mass in arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between F and total body mass, fat arms, and trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship between F and appendicular mass/lean index was observed.

**Conclusion:** FSH levels after AD may impact body composition, particularly lean mass. F could be a marker to monitor risk of sarcopenia and guide clinicians in evaluation of body in PC patients undergoing

    Title: 
    Article: Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD. We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation. DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD. 
 SCD in heart failure ( HF ) is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Current therapies for preventing SCD due to VT/VF are limited. For example, ICDs, the only effective therapy for VT/VF and SCD, are palliative, expensive, and pose several risks. Moreover, many patients suffer from VT/VF and SCD in the early stages of HF before they become eligible to receive an ICD ( Aziz et al., 2021; Butrous et al., 1992; Krishnan et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Vaseghi et al., 2017; Yalin et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2019; Zanoni et al., 2017; Tygesen et al., 1999 ). Antiarrhythmic drugs, which target ion channels, may confer acute benefits but can also be proarrhythmic, triggering VT/VF. Importantly, most antiarrhythmic drugs worsen survival over the longer term ( Echt et al., 1991; The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial II Investigators, 1992 ). Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new antiarrhythmic targets and develop new therapies for SCD. A growing body of evidence indicates that sympathetic stress-induced hyperactivity of the RyR2, located in the SR of cardiac myocytes, causes SR Ca2+ leak, which contributes to the pathogenesis of VT/VF and SCD ( Fischer et al., 2013; Alvarado and Valdivia, 2020; Wehrens et al., 2006; Eisner et al., 2009 ). During systole, the release of Ca2+ by the RyR2 plays a pivotal role in myocyte excitation-contraction coupling. The degree of contractility is determined by the amount of Ca2+ in the SR and by the timing and magnitude of Ca2+ release. In diseased and/or stressed hearts, PKA-mediated hyper-phosphorylation and ROS-mediated oxidation results in a leaky RyR2 ( Echt et al., 1991 ), which allows Ca2+ to leak out of SR during diastole. The consequent reduction in SR Ca2+ load weakens systolic contraction. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels also leads to DADs, which can trigger atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias ( Al-Khatib et al., 2018; Wehrens, 2007; Hamilton et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020 ). Recent evidence suggests that dantrolene, a RyR2 inhibitor, reduces the inducibility of atrial fibrillation in animals with myocardial infarction ( Azam et al., 2021; Zamiri et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Meissner et al., 1999 ). The effect of RyR2 inhibition on ventricular arrhythmias and non-ischemic HF has been unexplored. We hypothesized that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. The present study employs a guinea-pig model that recapitulates key features of human non-ischemic HF including spontaneous episodes of VT/VF resulting in SCD ( Dey et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2021 ). We examine the effects of chronic dantrolene treatment on the incidence of VT/VF and SCD incidence as non-ischemic HF develops and progresses. In cross-over studies, we determine whether RyR2 inhibition reverses HF and SCD risk. The findings have important implications for repurposing dantrolene, a clinically-used RyR2 inhibitor, as a potential new therapy for HF and SCD. 
 To study the effects of RyR2 leak inhibition on SCD and HF, we leveraged a pressure overload guinea pig model of HF/SCD with spontaneous arrhythmias. Unique to this model is the high incidence of premature ventricular contractions ( PVCs ) and VT/VF, leading to SCD in about two-thirds of the animals within 4 weeks. Notably, the SCD occurs early on, in the first 2 weeks over the course of cardiac hypertrophy, even before the heart dilates or progresses into failure ( Dey et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2014 ). Hence, the primary endpoint of our study was SCD, and the secondary endpoint was cardiac contractility measured by echocardiography at four weeks. To determine if Dantrolene sodium ( DS ) treatment can be used as a potential therapeutic agent, we treated the HF/SCD animals with and without oral DS in the early stages of heart failure ( Figure 1A ). HF animals exhibit frequent PVCs that often trigger sustained and non-sustained VT and VF, causing SCD ( Figure 1B ). DS treatment not only drastically reduced the rate of PVCs in early and late stages of HF ( Figure 1C ), but also improved survival ( Figure 1D ). Compared to the HF group, the HF + DS group had a significantly higher rate of survival ( 55% HF vs 80% in HF +DS, p<0. 05 ). Cardiac structure and function were preserved in HF animal treated with DS as compared to the HF group. In contrast to the HF group, the HF+DS group did not display a significant dilation of the LV at the 4 week endpoint ( Figure 2A ). Echocardiography measures ( Figure 2B ) show that the relative wall thickness ( RWT ), which is a measure of the LV dimensions and is a marker for adverse events in LV dysfunction, was significantly lower in HF group as compared to control ( Figure 2C, p<0. 05 ). Progressive decline of the RWT causes the end systolic volume ( ESV ) and the end diastolic volume ( EDV ) to increase and cardiac output to decrease. Reduced contractility and increased afterload both reduce the ejection fraction and increase end-systolic volumes in failing hearts ( Figure 2D–F ). Additionally, EDV increased ( not shown ) without an increase in the stroke volume. To summarize, chronic DS therapy in HF prevented the thinning of the LV walls and the eventual decline in cardiac contractility. Analysis of the myocardial structure showed an increase in interstitial fibrosis in the HF group compared to the normal controls. Whereas the fibrotic tissue was twofold higher in the untreated HF group compared to normal hearts, the HF+DS group displayed lower fibrotic tissue thereby confirming that DS therapy was delaying the progression of HF, keeping the myocardial architecture intact ( Figure 3A–B ). Interstitial fibrosis is a histopathological hallmark of heart failure and is associated with reduced contractility and increased risk of arrhythmias. In contrast to the HF group, the HF+ group showed a significant increase in Ry2 oxidation ( Figure 3C, p< 0.05 ), which is a marker of oxidative stress. The HF+ group showed a significant decrease in Ry2 oxidation ( Figure 3, p< 0.05 ), indicating reduced oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of HF and arrhythmias. Inhibition of Ry2 hyperactivity with drol mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcasmic Ca2 leak increases diolic Ca2 and ROS-mediated Ry2 oxidation thereby reducing repolar lability and protecting against VT/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase sarcasm Ca2 load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of Ry2 inhibition warrant further investigation as clinical studies repur drol as a new therapy for HF and SCD.
The article discusses the use of dantene as a potential therapy for preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) in heart failure (HF). The study used a guinea pig model that replicates key aspects of human non-ischem HF, such as prolonged QT interval, high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic S, and Ca2 leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to receive drol (DS) or placebo in early HF and assessed incidence of VT/V and S, ECG heart rate and variability, echocardi left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation.

Moreover, consequent increase sarcasm Ca load improves contractile function. These life-saving effects of Ry2 inhibition warrant further investigation as clinical studies repur drol as potential therapy for HF and SCD.

    Title: 
    Article: Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family, yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. In C. elegans, the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation. 
 Members of the TGF-β family of secreted ligands play numerous roles in development and disease. In humans, there are 33 ligand genes that can be broadly separated into two subfamilies: the TGF-β/Activin subfamily and the BMP subfamily ( Massagué, 1998 ). Due to the conservation of these ligands and their signaling pathways across metazoans, genetic studies in invertebrate systems have been instrumental in identifying signaling mechanisms ( Savage et al., 1996; Sekelsky et al., 1995 ). Canonical signaling occurs when ligand dimers bind to transmembrane receptors generating a heterotetrameric complex consisting of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Following ligand binding and complex assembly, the constitutively active type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor on the GS domain and thereby activates its kinase domain ( Wrana et al., 1994 ). The activated type I receptor phosphorylates the C-terminus of intracellular receptor-regulated Smads ( R-Smads ), promoting their heterotrimeric complex formation with co-Smads. The heterotrimeric Smad complex accumulates in the nucleus and binds DNA directly to elicit changes in gene expression ( Liu et al., 1995; Wrana et al., 1992; Estevez et al., 1993; Gerstein et al., 2010; Chacko et al., 2004; Souchelnytskyi et al., 1997; Qin et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 1996; Abdollah et al., 1997; Lagna et al., 1996; Nicolás et al., 2004 ). Co-Smads for all ligands and R-Smads for TGF-β/Activin ligands bind a 4 bp GTCT Smad Binding Element ( SBE ) ; furthermore, R-Smads for BMP ligands associate with GC-rich sequences ( GC-SBE ) ( Kim et al., 1997; Gao et al., 2005; Rushlow et al., 2001 ). The SBE is considered too degenerate and low affinity to account fully for binding specificity, so transcription factor partners likely contribute to target gene selection ( Hill, 2016 ). To date, only a few direct target genes of Smads have been extensively studied, including Drosophila brinker ( Pyrowolakis et al., 2004 ) ; Xenopus mixer ( Germain et al., 2000 ) and Xvent2 ( Yao et al., 2006 ) ; and the mammalian ATF3 and Id genes ( Kang et al., 2003 ). Genome-wide studies have the potential to expand these examples and elucidate general principles of target gene selection ( Deignan et al., 2016; Chiu et al., 2014; Morikawa et al., 2011 ). More of these studies are needed to understand how Smad transcriptional partners influence target gene selection and contribute to the execution of specific biological functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a BMP signaling cascade initiated by the ligand DBL-1 plays a major role in body size regulation ( Suzuki et al., 1999 ). In nematodes, body size is constrained by a collagen-rich cuticle, which is secreted by an epidermal layer ( the hypodermis ) and remodeled over four successive molts during larval growth and then continuously during adulthood ( Lazetic and Fay, 2017; Page and Johnstone, 2007 ). DBL-1 signals through type I receptor SMA-6, type II receptor DAF-4, and Smads SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4 ( founding members of the Smad family ), which act together in the hypodermis to promote body size growth during the earliest larval growth stages ( Gumienny and Savage-Dunn, 2013; Yoshida et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2002 ). The exact mechanism by which the DBL-1 pathway regulates body size is not fully understood, but is known to involve the regulated synthesis of cuticular collagen, of which there are over 170 genes ( Roberts et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2007; Madaan et al., 2018 ). A complete understanding of how DBL-1 regulates body size will require the identification of all direct transcriptional targets of the pathway during larval growth. In addition to body size, the DBL-1 pathway also regulates male tail patterning, mesodermal lineage specification, innate immunity, and lipid metabolism. A transcription factor partner for this pathway, SMA-9, has been identified that plays a role in each of these biological functions ( Foehr et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2003 ). Unlike for the core components of the signaling pathway, however, loss of SMA-9 function can result in a different effect depending on the phenotype, suggesting that this factor can either be an equivalent co-factor, a factor with a more limited role, or an antagonistic factor depending on the specific function ( Foehr et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2018a ). SMA-9 is the homolog of Drosophila Schnurri, which was identified for its roles in Dpp/BMP signaling ( Staehling-Hampton et al., 1995; Grieder et al., 1995; Arora et al., 1995 ). Three vertebrate Schnurri homologs regulate immunity, adipogenesis, and skeletogenesis, acting through both BMP-dependent and BMP-independent mechanisms ( Jin et al., 2006; Jones and Glimcher, 2010; Jones et al., 2006; Steinfeld et al., 2016 ). Schnurri proteins are very large transcription factors with multiple Zn-finger domains. At the brinker locus in Drosophila and the Xvent2 locus in Xenopus, binding of an R-Smad and a Co-Smad with a precise 5 bp spacing between binding sites has been shown to recruit Schnurri, which controls the direction of transcriptional regulation ( Yao et al., 2006 ). This model for Smad-Schnurri interaction has not been tested at a genomic scale. In this study, we use BETA software to combine RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets for SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri to identify direct versus indirect target genes of these factors, as well as to identify common versus unique targets ( Vora et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2013 ). Analysis of sma-3; sma-9 double mutants further extends our understanding of how these factors interact to produce locus-specific effects on target genes. We use GO term analysis and loss-of-function studies that shed light on the downstream effectors for body size regulation, lipid metabolism, and innate immunity. Finally, we use a ROL-6::wrmScarlet reporter for collagen synthesis and secretion to show that SMA-3, SMA-9, and the transcriptional target gene DPY-11 regulate body size growth by promoting the secretion and delivery of collagen into the cuticle. 
 Smads and Schnurri are known to bind DNA as a physical complex ( Dai et al., 2000; Müller et al., 2003 ), but their genomic interactions are not fully understood. Our results show that SMA-3/Sm and SMA-9/Schnri have overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcriptional activator and SMA-9/Schnri targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sm-9 partially suppress the small size phenotype of sm-3, indicating some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-car metabolism and ER secretory pathway, including disulf reductase-11. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnri have previously unreciated complex and genomic interactions that regulate secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body regulation.

    Title: 
    Article: Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. 
 Immune checkpoint inhibition ( ICI ) therapy utilizes immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies to stimulate patient anti-tumor immune responses. Blockade of T cell co-inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, has achieved major success in the treatment of diverse metastatic cancers compared to first-line chemotherapy ( Doki et al., 2022; Hellmann et al., 2019; Klein et al., 2020; Larkin et al., 2019; Motzer et al., 2020; Stein et al., 2022 ). However, a majority of advanced cancer patients fail to respond to ICI due to de novo or acquired resistance, the mechanistic bases of which remain incompletely understood. Diverse mechanisms modulate sensitivity and resistance to ICI ( Kalbasi and Ribas, 2020 ). These mechanisms include defects in Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) class I-mediated antigen presentation due to loss of B2M or HLA ( Grasso et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; McGranahan et al., 2016; Sade-Feldman et al., 2017; Sucker et al., 2014; Wolf et al., 2019 ), PTEN and LSD1 inactivation, which sensitizes tumor cells to type I interferon signaling ( Li et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2016; Sheng et al., 2018 ), T cell dysfunction ( Jiang et al., 2018 ), presence of specific T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment ( Gide et al., 2019 ), and active WNT–β-catenin signaling ( Spranger et al., 2015 ). Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling in BRAF-mutated melanomas and CDK4/CDK6 activity have also been implicated in reduced ICI efficacy, and combination treatment with an MAPK/CDK inhibitor improves response to checkpoint blockade ( Ascierto et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2018; Ebert et al., 2016; Goel et al., 2017; Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018; Ribas et al., 2019; Schaer et al., 2018; Sullivan et al., 2019 ). Tumor cell-intrinsic interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) signaling is particularly important in anti-tumor immunity. This pathway induces expression of genes involved in MHC class I-mediated antigen processing and presentation, which include genes encoding the TAP1/TAP2 transporters, components of the immunoproteasome, HLA proteins, and B2M ( Alspach et al., 2019 ). Thus, suppression of IFN-γ activity promotes tumor immune evasion and decreased CD8+ T cell activation. Indeed, decreased ICI efficacy was observed in patients with tumors harboring inactivating mutations in IFN-γ pathway genes such as JAK1 and JAK2 ( Gao et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2021; Sucker et al., 2017; Zaretsky et al., 2016 ). Similarly, a recent study reported a splicing-augmenting mutation in JAK3, linked to decreased JAK3 expression levels, as a potential mechanism of resistance in a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy ( Newell et al., 2022 ). Some cancers exhibit aberrant expression of embryonic DUX transcription factors. For instance, DUXB is expressed in diverse primary malignancies, most notably in testicular germ cell and breast carcinomas ( Preussner et al., 2018 ). Recent work from our group and others showed that DUX4 is expressed in a small subset of primary tumors, where it suppresses tumor cell antigen presentation and response to IFN-γ signaling ( Chew et al., 2019; Spens et al., 2023 ). We additionally observed signals that DUX4 expression was associated with reduced survival following response to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 in melanoma; however, those analyses relied upon two small cohorts ( n = 27 or 41 patients ), limiting the statistical power of our conclusions. In its native embryonic context, DUX4 initializes human zygotic genome activation. DUX4 expression levels peak at the 4-cell stage of the cleavage embryo; DUX4 is then immediately silenced via epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 repeat array that contains the DUX4 gene ( De Iaco et al., 2017; Hendrickson et al., 2017; Himeda and Jones, 2019; Sugie et al., 2020; Whiddon et al., 2017 ). Aside from select sites of immune privilege such as the testis, DUX4 remains silenced in adult somatic tissues ( Das and Chadwick, 2016; Snider et al., 2010 ). Since DUX4 expression in cancer cells suppresses MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation ( Chew et al., 2019 ), we hypothesized that DUX4 expression might be particularly common in the setting of metastatic disease ( vs. the primary cancers that we studied previously ), where immune evasion is particularly important. We therefore analyzed several large cohorts of patients with different metastatic cancers to determine the frequency of DUX4 expression in advanced disease. We additionally rigorously tested the potential importance of DUX4 expression for patient response to ICI in a well-powered cohort. 
 To assess the prevalence of DUX4-expressing human malignancies, we performed a large-scale analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data across diverse cancer types ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). The majority of the cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) are most commonly comprised of primary samples and local metastases. We found that DUX4 expression is a particularly common feature across advanced-stage cancers, with 10–50% of cancer samples ( depending upon cancer type ) displaying DUX4 expression levels comparable to or greater than those observed in the early embryo, where expression of the highly stereotyped DUX4-induced gene expression program is observed ( Chew et al., 2019; Hendrickson et al., 2017 ). A markedly higher proportion of advanced metastatic cancers express DUX4—and tend to have higher absolute DUX4 expression levels—than do their TCGA cancer counterparts ( Figure 1B, C ). We sought to determine if the DUX4 transcripts in metastatic cancers express the entire coding sequence or only a portion thereof, as expressed DUX4 truncations due to genomic rearrangements are frequent oncogenic drivers in particular cancer subtypes, most notably undifferentiated round cell sarcomas ( CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein ) ( Antonescu et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2013; Graham et al., 2012; Italiano et al., 2012; Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2016; Yoshimoto et al., 2009 ) and adolescent B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) ( Lilljebjörn et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2017; Yasuda et al., 2016 ). We aligned RNA-seq reads to the DUX4 cDNA sequence and examined read coverage over the open reading frame. Resembling the cleavage stage embryo and DUX4-expressing primary cancers, DUX4-positive metastatic tumors transcribe the full-length coding region. In contrast, B-cell ALL exhibited the expected C-terminal truncation due to DUX4 fusion with the IGH locus ( Figure 1D ). Since DUX4 is typically silent in most healthy tissue contexts outside the cleavage-stage embryo ( Das and Chadwick, 2016; Snider et al., 2010 ), we investigated if artifacts related to sequencing and sample processing could account for the observed high rates of DUX expression in metastatic cancers. However, DUX expression was validated by RT-qPCR in independent samples ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). We conclude that D4 is indeed aberrantly expressed in a subset of metastatic cancers. We next investigated the relationship between DUX expression and response to ICI in a cohort of patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) treated with anti-PD1 blockade ( n = patients ). We found that D4 expression was significantly associated with reduced response to PD-1 blockade ( Figure 2A ) and decreased overall survival ( Figure 2B ) even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other clinical features ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Median survival was reduced by over 1 year in patients with D4-expressing tumors compared to those lacking D4 ( Figure 2C ). These findings suggest that D4 is a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for I resistance in UC.

    Title: 
    Article: Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate ( a ) determinants of attribution; ( b ) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; ( c ) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; ( d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle ( n=71 ), sheep ( n=44 ), and goats ( n=100 ) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19. 5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms. 
 Livestock reproductive losses, including spontaneous abortion, are a major concern for the livestock industry worldwide, resulting in significant economic loss and posing a threat to public health ( Food and Agriculture Organization, 2011 ). The impacts of livestock abortion on the world’s poorest livestock-keepers, who are heavily dependent on livestock for food security and livelihoods ( Food and Agriculture Organization, 2011 ), is likely to be substantial. For these families, the loss of a livestock foetus and a subsequent decline in milk production reduces the availability of a high-quality food source ( milk ) that can be essential for childhood growth and cognitive development ( Neumann et al., 2003 ). In addition, livestock reproductive losses reduce income ( from sales of meat and milk ), and cause a loss of livestock assets that are a critical source of wealth, collateral or a safety net in times of need ( The World Bank, 2021 ). Recent analyses have shown that because of the need for increased spending on animal management, livestock abortions mayalso have indirect negative impacts on household expenditure and education ( Haseeb et al., 2019 ). Livestock abortion can also pose a direct threat to human health because many abortigenic agents are also zoonotic ( Givens and Marley, 2008; Thomas et al., 2022 ). Surveillance is defined as the real-time ( or near real-time ) collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health-related data to enable the early identification of the impact ( or absence of impact ) of potential health threats, which require effective action ( Hulth, 2014 ). Effective livestock health surveillance provides critical data for evidence-based approaches to livestock disease control and management but this requires reliable, high-quality, and timely data that can be drawn from multiple sources ( George et al., 2021 ). Over the past decade, increasing attention has been given to animal health syndromic surveillance ( Dórea and Vial, 2016 ), which relies on detection of health indicators, such as livestock abortion, that are discernible before a confirmed diagnosis is made. However, systematic reviews of the literature that collectively cover a period from 2000 to 2016 indicate that syndromic surveillance programmes have mostly been implemented in Europe, North America or Australasia with only a single pilot project identified in Africa ( Dórea and Vial, 2016; Dórea et al., 2011 ). In public health, event-based surveillance has also been gaining attention for the early detection of unusual events that might signal acute and emerging human health risks ( World Health Organization, 2008; Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018 ). This involves the collection, analysis and interpretation of information through both formal and informal channels to rapidly identify unusual or unexpected health events, such as disease outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, or other public health threats. Although the WHO guidelines for event-based surveillance ( World Health Organization, 2008 ) make explicit reference to the capture of information around unusual disease events in animals, the development of integrated early-warning systems involving animal disease events is still very limited. Livestock surveillance has a clear potential for identifying and preventing outbreaks of zoonotic and emerging diseases; a substantial proportion ( 39. 4% ) of livestock pathogens infect humans ( Cleaveland et al., 2001 ), and ungulates harbour more zoonotic pathogens than any other taxonomic group ( Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005 ). With several abortigenic agents also causing emerging livestock diseases, for example those caused by Schmallenberg virus, bluetongue virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, livestock abortion may represent a particularly important syndromic target for zoonotic and emerging disease surveillance. However, there is limited information available on current practices, effectiveness, and challenges/opportunities of livestock abortion surveillance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Livestock abortion has many causes, including infectious, nutritional, physical, and genetic factors. The diversity of causative agents and variation in the relative importance of agents across different livestock management systems and geographies makes abortion diagnosis complex and challenging ( Wolf-Jäckel et al., 2020 ). Challenges relate to timely collection of diagnostic samples, sample availability and deterioration, biases in detectability of agents, as well as complexities around establishment of a causal aetiology, particularly for pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii and Escherichia coli, which can often be present as incidental infections ( Thomas et al., 2022; Wolf-Jäckel et al., 2020 ). As a result, aetiological attribution of livestock abortion rarely exceeds 35%, even in well-resourced industrialised livestock systems ( Cabell, 2007; Wolf-Jäckel et al., 2020 ) and data are particularly sparse in African livestock systems. A recent prospective study of the aetiologies of livestock abortion, carried out in northern Tanzania ( Thomas et al., 2022 ), investigated 215 cases of livestock abortion of which an attribution was made in 41 cases ( 19% ). The infectious causes of abortion were identified as Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) in 14 cases ( 6. 6% ), followed by Neospora caninum in 10 ( 4. 7% ), pestiviruses in 9 ( 4. 2% ), Coxiella burnetii in 6 ( 2. 8% ), and Brucella sp., and Toxoplasma gondii in one case each ( 0. 5% ). Our study draws on the operational data generated from establishment of a livestock abortion study to examine characteristics of reporting and investigation of cases of livestock abortion. While this study was not designed as a systematic or comprehensive evaluation of a surveillance system, we present data on several key attributes ( ECDC, 2014 ) of the platform, including simplicity, data quality, representativeness, timeliness, and usefulness. We discuss our findings in relation to the feasibility, practicality, and value of establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa. 
 Between October 2017 and September 2019, 215 abortion cases were reported from 150 households in 13 of the 15 target wards. The distribution of investigated cases in relation to agro-ecological system and herd/flock composition is shown in Table 1. Out of the 150 households investigated, most ( n=115 ) had only one event investigated. Of the remaining households, 21 had two cases investigated, eight had three, two had four, three had five and one household had 11 cases investigated. Herd level summary statistics have been provided in Supplementary file 1. The sensitivity of the platform ( the percentage of expected abortion cases that were investigated ) ranged from 0% to 12. 4% for cattle, 0–1. 2% for goats and 0–0. 3% for sheep. A higher percentage of expected abortions in cattle were reported in smallholder wards ( 2. 7% ) than in other wards ( 0% for agropastoral and 0. 31% for pastoral wards ), with particularly high reporting in one smallholder ward, Machame Mashariki, close to Moshi town, where 12. 4% of expected cattle abortions were investigated. Over the 12 months preceding a reported abortion event, abortions, peri-natal mortalities, or stillbirths occurred in 52 of 184 ( 28. 3% ) cattle herds, 98 of 168 ( 58. 3 ) sheep, and 64 0 of 100 ( 64. ) goats. The distribution of abortion events by season is shown in Table 2. The highest number of cases were reported in the wet season, followed by the dry season, and lowest in the dry season. The distribution of abortion by species is shown in Table 3. Cattle were the most commonly affected, followed by sheep and goats. The distribution of abortion by breed is shown in Table 4. The most affected breeds were Boran, followed by Boran cross and then Bor cross. The distribution of abortion by previous history is shown in Table 5. The majority of cases had no previous history of abortion. The distribution of abortion by seasonality is shown in Table 6. The highest number of cases were in the wet season followed by the dry season and lowest in the dry season. The distribution of abortion by age is shown in Table 7. The majority of cases were less than 2 years old. The distribution of abortion by sex is shown in Table 8. The majority were female. The distribution of abortion by parity is shown in Table 9. The majority were nulliparous. The distribution of abortion by seasonality is shown in Table 10. The highest number were in the wet season followed by dry and lowest in dry.

    Title: 
    Article: Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. 
 All tissues and organs are generated from stem cells. Abnormal stem cell functions are significantly associated with age-related organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis ( Adams et al., 2015 ). Intestinal epithelial turnover is sustained by intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and adjacent Paneth cells. Paneth cells constitute the niche for ISCs that reside at the bottom of the crypts. Most of the ISCs are leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5 ) +ones that regulate intestinal homeostasis in response to dietary signals ( Igarashi and Guarente, 2016; Yilmaz et al., 2012 ). In the intestine, Lgr5 +ISCs are possibly the origin of precancerous adenomas ( Barker et al., 2009 ). For instance, long-term high-fat diet ( HFD ) -induced obesity enhances the self-renewal potential of ISC and promotes in vivo formation of tumors via the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in ISCs ( Beyaz et al., 2016 ). Moreover, cigarette smoking has emerged as a potential major risk factor associated with colon cancer, along with metabolic risk factors such as diet and obesity. Previous studies indicate that cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colon cancer and mortality in humans ( Botteri et al., 2008 ) and animal models ( Kim et al., 2008 ). Cigarette smoke contains a wide range of compounds that are harmful to human health; nicotine ( NIC ) derivatives 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) –1- ( 3-pyridyl ) –1-butanone ( NNK ) and N'-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) are highly carcinogenic ( Brunnemann and Hoffmann, 1991; Schuller et al., 1995 ), which can induce mutations in tumor suppressive genes like Rasa, Trp53, and Rb ( Sekido et al., 2003 ). Although NIC itself, the addictive component in cigarette smoke, is generally considered to have a limited ability to initiate cancer, it can stimulate several effects crucial for cancer development independently ( Schaal and Chellappan, 2014 ). However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated ISC functions and intestinal tumorigenicity is limited. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of NIC treatment on the functions of murine ISCs ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, we explored the molecular factors and signaling cascades prospectively associated with the regulation of the effects of NIC on ISCs. This study can potentially contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggest an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer. 
 Histological analyses of the small intestine in C57BL/6 mice treated with 200 μg/ml NIC ( which emulates active smoking ) revealed that NIC exposure decreased villus length without affecting crypt size ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ), which was consistent with NIC-induced decrease in the number of differentiated cells, including absorptive enterocytes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) or chromogranin A+enteroendocrine cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ), in the gut. We investigated the effect of NIC on the population of proliferative cells in the crypts using Ki67 labeling to mark proliferative stem and progenitor cells in the crypts. NIC exposure increased abundance of Ki67-positive cells in the small and large intestine ( Figure 1A and B ). Consistently, the number of proliferative olfactomedin-4 ( Olfm4 ) -positive ISCs significantly increased in the small intestine of NIC-treated mice ( Figure 1C ). Moreover, the number of LgR5 +colonic stem cells ( CSCs ) was increased in NIC-treated Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 mice expressing EGFP under the control of the LgR5 promoter ( Figure 1D ). Paneth cells support the proliferation of ISCs. However, we did not observe any changes in the number of Paneth cells in NIC-treated mice ( Figure 1E ). These results indicate that the self-renewal of ISCs in NIC-treated mice increased with a reciprocal decrease in the number of differentiated cells. Our ISC proliferation analysis using intestinal crypts of wild-type mice revealed that a range of nicotine concentrations ( 100 nM, 1 µM, and 10 µM ) promoted the organoid formation from crypts from the small intestine ( Figure 2A ), which was consistent with the in vivo data ( Figure 1A and C ). However, the same dose of cotinine, a minor tobacco alkaloid, and a major metabolite of NIC ( Tan et al., 2021 ) did not exhibit similar effects ( Figure 2A ). Furthermore, the addition of 1 µM NIC promoted the organoid formation from colonic crypts ( Figure 2B ). Next, to address how ISCs and Paneth cells interact functionally, we isolated Lgr5-positive ISCs and Paneth cells from control or NIC-treated Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 mice as described previously ( Igarashi and Guarente, 2016 ). ISCs and Paneth cells were co-cultured in the culture media containing glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β ) inhibitor CHIR99021, which induces β-catenin and thus stimulates organoid formation ( Igarashi and Guarente, 2016; Yin et al., 2014 ). Lgr5-positive ISCs isolated from NIC mice formed more organoid colonies than those isolated from control mice when cultured with or without Paneth cells ( Figure 2C ). Consistently, the addition of 1 µM NIC to control ISCs stimulated the organoid colony formation ( Figure 2D ). However, Paneth cells exhibited no significant difference in function ( organoid formation ) between control and NIC-treated groups, with or without CHIR99021 ( Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Therefore, this ex vivo assay for ISC function and ISC–Paneth cell interaction demonstrated that NIC directly stimulates ISC proliferation without affecting the supportive function of Paneth cell for ISC. We investigated the pathway underlying the NIC-regulated proliferation of ISCs. NIC interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAchRs ), which are heterodimers of nine types of α subunits ( α2–α10 ) and three types of β subunits ( β2– β4 ) ( Dani, 2015 ). We validated the significance of nAChR signal transduction using ISCs, isolated wild-type mice cultured in the presence of NIC, and the nonselective nAChR antagonist Mecamylamine, which indicated that Mecamylamine treatment completely abolishes the NIC-mediated formation of ISC-derived organoids ( Figure 3A ). We further explored the nAChR subtypes. Considering that NIC has a high affinity for the nAChR comprised of α4 and β2 subunits ( McGranahan et al., 2011 ), we cultured ISCs in the presence of NIC and Adiphenine, a non-competitive inhibitor of nAChR ( α1, α3β4, α4β2, and α4β4 ). However, Adiphenine exhibited no effect on the NIC-induced organoid formation from ISCs, indicating that the effect of NIC was not mediated by these nAChRs ( Figure 3B ). As some cancer stem cells are known to express α7-nAChR ( Egleton et al., 2008; Hirata et al., 2010 ), we further analyzed the role of α7-nAChR. The existence of α7-nAChR in ISCs was detected by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, respectively ( Figure 3C and D ). The higher expression of α7 and α9 subunits in both ISCs and Paneth cells were observed compared with other nAChR subunits ( Figure 3C and D ). Moreover, α7-nACh agonist PNU-282987 inhibited the NIC-induced organoid formation ( Figure 3E ) while α-nACh antagonist methyllycaconitine had no effect ( Figure 3 ) indicating that α7-nACh mediates the effect of NIC on ISCs. Next, we investigated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC ) in NIC-induced ISC proliferation. PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival ( Nish et al. 2011 ) PKC is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG ) which is produced by phospholipase C ( PLC ) activated by nACh signaling ( Dani,201 ) We used the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 which abolished the NIC-induced organoid formation ISC ( Figure 4A ) indicating that PKC mediates the effect of NIC on ISCs. Furthermore, we examined the involvement of Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding ( TAZ ) in NIC-induced ISC proliferation. YAP is a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis ( Zhang et al. 2007 ) TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator of YAP ( Zhang et al 2007 ) The expression of YAP and TAZ in ISCs was detected by RT-PCR ( Figure 4B ) and immunobting ( Figure 4C ) The expression of Y and TAZ increased in NIC-treated IS compared to control ( Figure 4 and C ) Moreover, the NIC-induced organoid formation was inhibited by TAZ siRNA ( Figure 4 ) indicating that TAZ mediates the effect of NIC on IS. Finally, we explored the involvement of Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC proliferation. Notch signaling is a key regulator of cell fate, proliferation, and tumorigenesis ( Artavanis et al 2000 ) Notch is activated by ligand Jagged (Jag ) and Serrate (S ) binding to the Not receptor Notch intracellular domain (ICD ) ( Artavan et 200 ) We used the Notch inhibitor dibenzepine (DB ) which abolished NIC-induced organoid formation ISC ( Figure 5 ) indicating that Notch signaling mediates the effect of NIC on IS. Moreover, DB inhibited the growth of tumors formed from IS after loss of tumor suppressor gene Apc ( Figure 5 ) indicating that Notch signaling is involved in tumorigenesis of IS. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NIC increases the proliferation of ISCs in vivo and ex vivo via α-nAChR and PKC activation and YAP TAZ signaling. The effect of NIC on IS was not observed in Pan cells. Inhibition of Not signaling by DB nullified the effects of NIC on IS and inhibited tumor growth from IS after loss of tumor suppressor gene A. This study identifies NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumenicity of IS and suggests the use of DB as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

    Title: 
    Article: Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential. 
 During stress, protein homeostasis is perturbed by protein misfolding and aggregation. Accumulation of protein aggregates disrupts cellular functions and contributes to ageing and is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases ( Hartl et al., 2011; Morimoto, 2008 ). A protein quality control system, relying on a network of cooperating chaperones, has evolved to moderate stress-induced proteotoxicity and rebalance proteostasis. To refold proteins from aggregates into their native state, eukaryotes use a system comprising Hsp70, an ATP-dependent chaperone, and its co-chaperones: an Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor ( NEF ) and a J-domain protein ( JDP/Hsp40 ), together with an Hsp100 disaggregase ( Glover and Lindquist, 1998 ). The process is initiated by a JDP, which delivers Hsp70 to an aggregated substrate and whose J-domain induces ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70, resulting in conformational changes that stabilise the interaction with aggregates ( Rohland et al., 2022 ). Next, Hsp100 interacts with the Hsp70-aggregate complex and the aggregate-trapped polypeptides are translocated through the Hsp100 hexamer. The disentangled and released polypeptides can fold back into their native conformation, alone or with further aid of chaperones ( Lum et al., 2004; Schaupp et al., 2007; Seyffer et al., 2012; Weibezahn et al., 2004; Zietkiewicz et al., 2004 ). Hsp110 co-chaperone boosts the Hsp70 activity by stimulating nucleotide exchange and substrate release ( Dragovic et al., 2006; Raviol et al., 2006; Shaner et al., 2005 ). It belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily, with identical domain organisation to Hsp70 but distinct size and arrangement of the nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD ) and substrate-binding domain ( SBD ) ( Easton et al., 2000; Liu and Hendrickson, 2007 ). In contrast to Hsp70, Hsp110 is unable to refold denatured proteins, yet it may bind to and prevent aggregation of certain misfolding substrates ( Garcia et al., 2017; Glover and Lindquist, 1998; Goeckeler et al., 2002; Oh et al., 1997; Oh et al., 1999; Polier et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2012 ). In its well-established NEF function, the NBD of Hsp110 interacts with the ADP form of Hsp70, which mediates the release of the nucleotide. Subsequent ATP binding to the NBD of Hsp70 prompts the opening of the SBD and substrate dissociation, resetting Hsp70 for another round of the cycle ( Andréasson et al., 2008a; Laufen et al., 1999; Liberek et al., 1991; Mayer and Bukau, 2005; Mayer and Gierasch, 2019 ). In vivo studies on yeast chaperones demonstrated that the Hsp110 co-chaperone Sse1 plays a key role in Hsp70 recruitment to aggregates and is essential for protein disaggregation ( Kaimal et al., 2017 ). Hsp110 is a major cytoplasmic NEF of Hsp70 and the deletion of its both paralogs, SSE1 and SSE2, is lethal and the growth can only be supported, albeit with less efficacy, by overexpression of FES1, another cytoplasmic NEF from an unrelated armadillo family ( Abrams et al., 2014; Raviol et al., 2006 ). The importance of Hsp110 is also manifested in vitro in the low disaggregation activity of the yeast Hsp70 system without Hsp110 and the complete interdependence between their human orthologs ( Glover and Lindquist, 1998; Mattoo et al., 2013; Nillegoda et al., 2015; Rampelt et al., 2012 ). Recent studies on the human system revealed that Hsp110 function in disaggregation of amyloid fibrils is not limited to its NEF activity but it may also affect the architecture of chaperone complexes, inducing Hsp70 clustering, although it is not clear whether similar effects occur during disaggregation of non-fibrillar, stress-associated aggregates. The effect is not well understood, but it presumably increases entropic pulling of aggregated polypeptides, ultimately leading to their disentanglement by the Hsp70 system, efficient even without the Hsp100 disaggregase. Developing an Hsp70 system that is self-sufficient in disaggregation could have compensated for the loss of the Hsp100 disaggregase in a common metazoan ancestor ( Mattoo et al., 2013; Shorter, 2011 ). Another factor that potentiates the Hsp70 system is the diversity of JDP paralogs, assigned to cytoplasmic classes A and B, which differently regulate Hsp70 ( Lu and Cyr, 1998; Nillegoda et al., 2015 ). The main distinction between class A and B JDPs is an auxiliary interaction site between CTD1 domain of class B JDPs and the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70 ( Yu et al., 2015 ). Class B JDPs are additionally regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism, in which Hsp70 binding by the J-domain is restricted by a neighbouring helix. Upon binding to the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70, the J-domain is released and it can interact with the NBD of Hsp70 ( Faust et al., 2020; Wentink et al., 2020 ). We have recently shown that the yeast class A JDP Ydj1 and class B JDP Sis1 exhibit diverse mechanisms during Hsp70 binding to aggregated substrates. Ydj1, in accordance with the classical model of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle, binds misfolded polypeptides and loads Hsp70 onto aggregates. Unlike that, Sis1 only weakly binds protein substrates but due to the more complex interaction with Hsp70, it loads more Hsp70 molecules onto aggregates, which results in more efficient disaggregation ( Wyszkowski et al., 2021 ). Despite the vast knowledge on how Hsp110 serves as a regulator of the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 ( Andréasson et al., 2008a; Andréasson et al., 2008b; Dragovic et al., 2006; Raviol et al., 2006; Shaner et al., 2006 ), little is known about the function of Hsp110 considering the mechanism of Hsp70 interaction with different JDP classes. Here, we demonstrate that the interplay between Hsp110 and Hsp70 in disaggregation strictly relies on the class of a JDP and unravel the critical role of the B-class-specific interaction with the EEVD motif of Hsp70 for the Hsp110-dependent stimulation. Furthermore, we elucidate differential contribution of the NEF across different phases of protein recovery from aggregates. We employ biolayer interferometry ( BLI ) to investigate the Hsp110 impact on the formation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface and we assess changes in aggregates’ properties associated with the abundant chaperone binding. Finally, we address a question of the competition between the NEF and JDP co-chaperones. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms behind the potentiation and inhibition of the disaggregation activity of Hsp70 by its co-chaperones. 
 Our recent studies showed that during the recovery of aggregated proteins, the Hsp70 chaperone system exhibits different mechanisms of action with different classes of JDPs. Class A JDPs, such as Ydj1, interact with the substrate and load H70 onto the aggregate, whereas class B JDPs, such as Sis, interact with H70 and load more H70 molecules onto the aggregate ( Wysowski et al., 202 ). Here, we demonstrate that H110 plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining the efficacy of the process. We show that H110 stimulates the recruitment of H70 onto the surface of aggregates, leading to the formation of smaller species that are more readily processed by chaper. The interaction between H110 and H70 is stronger with class B JDPs than class A and requires the auxiliary interaction between BDP and the EE motif of H70. Furthermore, we show that H110 disrupts the interaction between JDP and H70, destabilising the chaper complex at the aggregate surface, which might improve disaggregation but also leads to inhibition of the suboptimal H110. The interplay between the co-chaper and H70 is critical to unlock the disaggregating potential of H70 during stress, protein homeostasis is perturbed by protein misfolding and aggregation. Accumulation of aggregates disrupts cellular functions and contributes to ageing and is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases ( Hart et al. 201; Mor 2008 ) A protein quality system relying on a network of cooperating chaper has evolved to moderate stress-induced proteity and rebalance proteasis To refold proteins from aggregates into native, eukotes use a system comprising H70 an ATP chaper and its coaper H110 nucleotide exchange ( NE ) and J-domain (DP H40 together with H100greg ( Glover and Lindquist 1998 ) The process initiated by J which delivers H70 to aggregated and J-domain induces ATP in H70 resulting conformation changes stabilise interaction ( Rohland et al 202 ) Next H interacts with H70-aggregate and aggregate-trapped polype are translocated through H100 The disangled and released polype can fold into native or with aid chaper ( Lum et al 200 Schaupp et 2007 Seyffer et 2012 Weezahn et 2004 Zkiewicz 200 ) H110 coaper boosts H70 by stimulating nucleotide and substrate ( Drag et al 2006 Ravi et 200 Shaner 200 ) belongs to H super with identical organisation but distinct NBD and S ( East et 200 Liu Hendson 200 ) Unlike H70 H is unable refold denature but may bind prevent aggregation ( Garcia et  Glover Lind 199 Goeck et 2002 Oh et 199 Oh 199 Polier 201 Xu 201 ) in well-established NE the N of H interacts AD form H which mediates release Subsequent ATP NBD prompts opening S and dissociation resetting H for another cycle ( Andréass et 200a Laufen et 199 Lib et 199 Mayer Buk 200 Mayer 201 ) in vivo studies on chaper demonstrated H plays key in H70 recruitment and essential protein ( Kaim et 201 ) H is major cytoplasm NE of H and deletion paral SSE and SSE is lethal and growth only supported by overexpression F1 another cytoplasm from unrelated armillo ( Abrams et  Ravi 200 ) importance also in vitro in disag activity without H and complete interdependence human ( Glover Lind  Mat 2013 Nilleg 201 Rampelt 201 ) studies human revealed function in amyloid not limited NE but may architecture chone inducing H70 although clear similar during non-fibrar stress aggregates effect not understood increases entropic polype leading disang by H system efficient without H100 ( Mat 201 Short 1 ) factor potates H system diversity J par assigned cytoplasm classes differently regulate ( Lu Cyr  Nil 201 ) distinction

    Title: 
    Article: Gait is impaired in musculoskeletal conditions, such as knee arthropathy. Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response. However, clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment, large-scale facilities, and highly trained staff required. Relatively low-cost wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges. In this work, we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard. To achieve this, we constructed a machine learning model, trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls. This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROC] = 0. 86; area under the precision-recall curve [auPR] = 0. 90 ) and of a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0. 83; auPR = 0. 86 ). After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements, we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods, adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines, and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments, with the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring. 
 Gait assessment plays several roles in clinical practice and research for many musculoskeletal and orthopedic diseases, such as diagnosis, guiding treatment selection, and measuring intervention response. ( Lord et al., 1998 ). Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) contributes to altered gait as individuals try to avoid knee pain and cartilage contact stress ( i. e., weight shift or joint loading onto the non-affected limb ) ( Iijima et al., 2019; Kaufman et al., 2001 ). Those with knee OA commonly have increased lateral trunk lean toward the ipsilateral limb, along with non-significantly increased trunk/pelvic flexion and resultant significant alterations in external hip adduction moments ( Iijima et al., 2019 ). Clinically, gait is examined in knee OA through clinical visual observation of walking, which is subjective and dependent on expertise. Beyond visual observation, gait has been traditionally objectively assessed in specialized gait laboratories with expensive equipment, such as force platforms, with or without a motion-tracking system. However, gait laboratories are generally not available or feasible within clinical settings due to cost, need for highly trained staff to operate equipment, and the size of equipment. Wearable sensors offer an alternative approach to assessment of gait in those with knee OA ( Mills et al., 2013 ) as they can be deployed within any environment or setting ( Stern et al., 2022 ), are relatively low-cost, and can provide outcomes automatically without the need for highly experienced or trained staff. Vertical ground reaction force ( vGRF ) is a gait characteristic that is impaired within knee OA as it relates to the bilateral weightbearing capabilities of the patient ( i. e., greater peak vGRF ) ( Creaby et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2019; Trentadue et al., 2021 ). Traditionally, vGRF is objectively examined using force plates, which can provide three components of force ( vertical, anterior-posterior, and medio-lateral ) ( Creaby et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2019; Trentadue et al., 2021 ). Force plate signals can provide information on gait characteristics, postural stability, as well as direction, strength, and duration of stance phase ( Arslan et al., 2019; Whittle, 2007 ). However, force plates only capture intermittent data on vGRF ( single or several steps ) within controlled experiments that do not represent real-world overground walking. Technological development has led to digital insoles ( wearables ) that can capture vGRF and other gait characteristics that are relevant to knee OA assessment, which could be used within free-living environments ( Stern et al., 2022 ). The data generated from digital insoles may allow for phenotyping information to characterize patients with knee OA. However, clinical application of wearable digital insoles for gait analysis in knee OA is limited by a paucity of analytical validation data ( including face, criterion, and construct validity ), such as comparison of gait outcome measures in those with knee OA to ‘gold-standard’ laboratory references ( e. g., force plate outcomes ) ( Goldsack et al., 2020; Rochester et al., 2020 ). Gait quantitation generates dense raw sensor time-series data with nonlinear relationships that make analysis and interpretation challenging. As a class, digital gait data analysis pipelines suffer from a lack of well-established analytical methods compared to other biomarker data types ( Wipperman et al., 2022; Crouthamel et al., 2021; Horst et al., 2019 ). Recently, there is interest in developing more streamlined ( ‘light-weight’ ) gait algorithms and data processing pipelines using machine learning ( ML ) to automate and process large volumes of novel digital data obtained from wearable devices ( Celik et al., 2022; Godfrey et al., 2018 ). An ML framework may be used as a tool to evaluate the digital gait outcome quality and consistency, as well as how well these data can be used as potential clinical trial endpoints. Selection of the appropriate modeling modalities for a particular clinical question is challenging ( Horst et al., 2019; Slijepcevic et al., 2022 ). The selection of classical ML versus deep learning methods may be influenced by the structure and size of the data. For example, deep learning models are better suited to handle high-throughput, multimodal data streams, such as raw sensor time series ( Alias, 2018; Briouza et al., 2021 ), but typically require larger datasets than classical statistical or ML methods ( in terms of both features and sample size ). Finally, clinical wearable data may be collected over several seconds to minutes, and longer in passive monitoring settings; thus, appropriate understanding of large dataset processing is important. Collectively, both data type, size, and model selection are key components of a comprehensive wearable sensor data analysis pipeline and should be considered when evaluating clinical research pipelines with large heterogeneous datasets. This study aimed to assess the face validity of measuring vGRF using digital insoles compared to the standard laboratory reference of force plates in control adults and those with knee arthropathy. We also aimed to clinically validate the measurement of gait with digital insoles in those with knee arthropathy through ( 1 ) development of a novel ML framework ( based on ‘gold-standard’ force plate data ) for application within digital insoles to detect knee arthropathy status and ( 2 ) processed digital insole-derived gait outcomes and raw sensor signals to identify disease-specific gait patterns in knee arthroscopy. Clinical validity is the ability to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures, including the detection of disease-specific patterns relative to controls, and the identification of subject-specific gait patterns. 
 vGRF is the major and clinically relevant component of the ground reaction forces generated from walking and can be measured using force plates or digital insoles. We obtained vGRF data from the three studies: the GaitRec Force Plate study of subjects with knee injuries ( N = 625 ) and controls ( N = 211 ) and two digital insole studies in controls ( N = 22 ) and subjects with knee OA ( N = 40 ), respectively ( Figure 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). We plotted raw and normalized vGRF values recorded by force plate and digital insole devices and observed by visual inspection that the means of vGRF curves within each disease category are similar across platforms ( Figure 2A ), which highlights face validity of the digital insoles ( i. e., the insole data appeared similar to the force plate data ). Furthermore, we observed distinct patterns between control subjects and those with knee arthropathy when comparing the normalized vGRF values averaged by group ( Figure 2A ) or per individual ( Figure 2B ). Specifically, individuals with knee arthropathy from all evaluated datasets displayed a qualitatively different gait signature than controls, with a ‘flatter’ vGRF curve shape during the middle of stance phase ( we use the term ‘arthropathy’ to encompass both knee injury and OA ). Using a dimension reduction approach Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) with normalized vGRF data from each subject in two dimensions, subjects at a population level separated out by arthropathy status ( knee arthropathies vs controls ) rather than by measurement platform ( Figure 2C ). Thus, despite performing analysis on data collected from different devices at different sites, we could discern disease-relevant patterns in the vGRF data and show that the digital insole data recapitulated the force plate data. Next, we trained a ML model to predict vGR from insole data using force plate data from the Gait Force study ( N = 625 ). The model was highly predictive of vGR insole data from the validation set ( AUROC = 0.86, AUPR = 0.90 ) and a separate independent insole dataset ( AU = 0.83 AUP = 0.86 ). This demonstrates that the insole-derived vGR can be used to detect knee arthrop status with high sensitivity and specificity. We also showed that a single stride of raw time-series data can be assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals can be identified by their g characteristics using digital insoles. This work provides a framework for an alternative to traditional gait analysis methods, adds to the body of knowledge regarding wearable analytical pipelines, and supports the development of at-home assessments with the potential to improve ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.

    Title: 
    Article: Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ), a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. 
 Surgery or trauma may lead to persistent pain, impeding functional recovery and causing considerable distress ( Kehlet et al., 2006 ). Continuous reliance on opioid analgesics causes severe side effects and accidental death, which resulted in a national public health emergency being declared in 2017 ( Colvin et al., 2019 ). Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid alternative therapies for managing post-surgical/post-operative pain. An optimal strategy would be to develop local treatments that both inhibit pain and address the underlying pathophysiology, such as neuronal sensitization while avoiding the central side effects of commonly used analgesics ( Patapoutian et al., 2009 ). A naturally occurring biologic derived from human birth tissues has recently gained our attention as a potential solution for this challenging problem. The birth tissue is predominantly comprised of the amniotic membrane ( AM ) and umbilical cord ( UC ), which share the same cell origin as the fetus. These versatile biological tissues have been used as medical therapy in a wide range of conditions ( Chao et al., 1940; de Rotth, 1940 ). FLO ( Clarix Flo; BioTissue, Miami, FL ) is a sterile, micronized, and lyophilized form of human AM/UC matrix used for surgical and non-surgical repair, reconstruction, or replacement of soft tissue by filling in the connective tissue void. They have been shown to orchestrate regenerative healing within its anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties in ophthalmic applications ( Tighe et al., 2020 ). Intriguingly, FLO also appears to relieve pain effectively in several ocular surface disorders ( Espana et al., 2003; Finger, 2008; Morkin and Hamrah, 2018 ), and musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis ( Castellanos and Tighe, 2019; Mead and Mead, 2020 ) and lower extremity neuropathy ( Buksh, 2020 ). However, the mechanisms underlying its potential pain-inhibitory properties and how it may affect sensory neuron excitability remain unknown. In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain, we first explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain. We then purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ), which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM. The natural process of HC-HA/PTX3 formation may involve: Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein covalently binds to HC1 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and then transfers it to high-molecular-weight hyaluronan ( HMW-HA ). At this point, HC1 becomes conjugated, and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 is released. PTX3 then tightly associates with the HC1–HA complex by binding to the HC1. HC-HA/PTX3 was recently shown to alleviate dry eye disease induced by chronic graft-versus-host disease by suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands ( Ogawa et al., 2017 ). We hence investigated whether HC-HA/PTX3 is a key bioactive component mediating the pain relief effects of FLO and further examined its mode of action. Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. 
 Intra-paw injection of FLO, but not the vehicle ( saline ) acutely inhibited heat nociception in naive wild-type ( WT ) mice ( Figure 1A ). Moreover, FLO dose-dependently ( 0. 1–0. 5 mg ) attenuated heat hypersensitivity in the hindpaw receiving the plantar-incision ( Figure 1B ), and inhibited mechanical hyperalgesia in the Randall–Sellito test ( Figure 1C ). In the Catwalk assay, FLO partially normalized the impaired gaiting caused by incision, as indicated by increases in print area and max contact area from pre-drug levels ( Figure 1D, E ), suggesting an attenuation of movement-evoked pain which is common after surgery. FLO caused no impairment in locomotor function or exploratory activity in the open-field test ( Figure 1F ) ; these symptoms are known side effects of opioid use. The concentration of FLO we used fell within the range reported in previous clinical studies ( Ackley et al., 2019; Bennett, 2019; Castellanos and Tighe, 2019 ). Since nociceptive neuron hyperexcitability may lead to persistent pain ( Xie et al., 2005; Zimmermann, 2001 ), cellular mechanisms of pain inhibition by FLO can be partly inferred from its modulatory effects on these neurons’ excitability. We employed PirtCre;Rosa26lsl-GCaMP6s mice that exclusively express GCaMP6 ( a fluorescent calcium indicator ) ( Chen et al., 2013 ) in primary sensory neurons to enable high throughput in vivo calcium imaging of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons ( Kim et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2022; Figure 2A ). Intra-paw injection of FLO selectively reduced the activation of small-diameter DRG neurons, which are mostly nociceptive neurons, to noxious heat stimulation after plantar-incision ( Figure 2B–D ). We then purified HC-HA/PTX3 from the water-soluble extract of human AM ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B ), and biochemically and functionally characterized it using western blot and TRAP assays ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E; He et al., 2009 ). HC-HA/PTX3 was suggested to be a biologically active component with uniquely high amounts in human birth tissues ( Chen et al., 2015; He et al., 2009; He et al., 2014 ). However, it remains unclear whether HC-HA/PTX3, as a key component, is responsible for FLO’s inhibitory effects on neuron activation and pain. Like FLO, intra-paw injection of HC-HA/PTX3 dose-dependently ( 10–20 μg ) induced heat antinociception in naive WT mice and attenuated heat hypersensitivity developed in the hindpaw after plantar-incision ( Figure 3A ). Moreover, HC-HA/PTX3-induced pain inhibition was comparable between male and female mice after plantar-incision ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). HMW-HA, a major component of HC-HA/PTX3, was suggested to attenuate inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain induced by the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel ( Bonet et al., 2020; Bonet et al., 2021b; Bonet et al., 2022; Ferrari et al., 2018 ). We hence examined the effect of HMW-HA on post-surgical pain, which is unknown. We compared the efficacy of HC-HA/PTX3 and HMW-HA, both at an amount of 20 μg since the weight of HC-HA/PTX3 was determined based on its HMW-HA content. At its peak ( 1 hr post-drug ), HC-HA/PTX3 demonstrated a significantly more potent anti-hyperalgesic effect than HMW-HA, and this effect persisted for over 4 hr ( Figure 3B ). In contrast, the effect of HMW-HA had largely dissipated by approximately the 4 hr mark. Additionally, we tested the treatment using a mixture of HMW-HA and HC1, another important component of HC-HA/PT3 ( Figure 3— supplement 3 ). The combination of HM-HA and HC1 did not induce antinocice in naive mice ( Figure 3— supplement 4 ), suggesting that HC/PT3 is the bioactive component mediating the pain relief of F and HC/PT3. HC/PT3 induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium and high-voltage activated current in nocice DRG neurons ( Figure 4A–C ). HC/PT -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the actin inhibitor latrunculin ( Figure 4D ), indicating that the cytoskeleton plays a key role in the mechanism of action of HC/3. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were also blocked by the calcium chelator BAPTA ( Figure 4E ) suggesting that calcium is involved in the mechanism of action of HC/3. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were not blocked by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin ( Figure 4F ) indicating that sodium channels are not involved in the mechanism of action of HC3. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were not blocked by the potassium channel blocker TEA ( Figure 4 ) indicating that potassium channels are not involved in the mechanism of action of HC3. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the calcium channel blocker verapamil ( Figure 4 ) indicating that calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC3. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the calcium channel nifedipine ( Figure 4 ) indicating that calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the calcium blocker BAPTA ( Figure 4 ) indicating that calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the calcium blocker BTA ( Figure 4 ) indicating that calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. HC/3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the blocker BTA ( Figure 4 ) indicating that calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. HC3 -induced cytoskeleton rearrangements were blocked by the blocker ( Figure 4 ) indicating that calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. HC3 -induced cytos rearrangements were blocked by the blocker ( Figure 4 ) indicating calcium channels are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. HC -induced cytos rearrangements were blocked by blocker ( Figure 4 ) that calcium are involved in the mechanism of action of HC. -induced cytos rearrangements were blocked by ( Figure 4 ) calcium in the mechanism of action of HC -induced cytos rearr were blocked by ( 4 ) in the mechanism of HC -ind cytos rearr were blocked by ( 4 in the mechanism of HCind cytos were blocked by 4 in the mechanism of HC cytos were blocked 4 in the mechanism cy were blocked 4 in the mechanism were blocked 4 the mechanism in were 4 the mechanism 4 were 4 the 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4

    Title: 
    Article: Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level. For this purpose, we utilized our recent invention, Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles. We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation, from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE. 
 RPE is a layer of cells paved by hexagonal, brown-pigmented cells, which locates between the neural retina and the choroid. RPE cells play an important role in maintaining the visual system by supplying nutrition to the photoreceptors, phagocytosing mature outer segments of the photoreceptors, facilitating visual/retinoid cycle to produce a photosensitive derivative of vitamin A, absorbing stray light for the vision, and secreting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) for the maintenance of choroid blood vessels ( Kim et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2022 ). Abnormalities in the RPE cause a wide variety of retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) which is a devastating disease leading to blindness. Medication for AMD is limited, and there are increasing attention on cell transplantation of RPE for the treatment. RPE transplantation for AMD to replace degenerated RPE with fetal RPE was introduced almost three decades ago ( Algvere et al., 1994 ). Later, transplantation of autologous peripheral RPE to the degenerated site has also been reported ( Binder et al., 2002 ). Our laboratory has pioneered in the production of RPE cells from iPSC and ocular transplantation of iPSC-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) to replace degenerated RPE of AMD patients ( Mandai et al., 2017; Sugita et al., 2020 ). For quality management of iPSC-RPE transplants, we routinely verify the expressions of key factors such as RPE65, Bestrophin, CRALBP, and MERTK by quantitative PCR; PAX6 and microphthalmia transcription factor ( MiTF ) by immunostaining; and pigment epithelium-derived factor glycoprotein ( PEDF ) and VEGF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ). The morphology and pigmentation are also qualitatively checked, but there has been no means to link these appearances with gene expression. Our recent invention, ALPS, enables the characterization of a cell that is actually showing a behavior of interest ( Jin et al., 2023 ). While monitoring the cells in live, ALPS enables to pick up one single-cell for further manipulation. In the present study, we utilized this system to monitor the color of iPSC-RPE cells, then to pick up one of the cells, followed by RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of that single-cell. In this way, we concluded the color of iPSC-RPE cells did not project any specific gene expression profile. We reasoned this by analyzing the correlation between the color and the expression level of each gene. We found the genes that define pigmentation itself had less correlation with the color, suggesting the color in appearance is a temporal condition that does not directly represent the function of the RPE. 
 iPSC-RPE cells were produced from two human iPSC-lines of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application ( CiRA; iPSC-lines 201B7 and 253G1 ). The quality of the generated iPSC-RPE cells were verified by the expressions of RPE65, Bestrophin, CRALBP, and MERTK by quantitative PCR; PAX6, MiTF, and Bestrophin by immunostaining; and PEDF and VEGF by ELISA. Hexagonal morphology and pigmentation were also confirmed qualitatively ( Figure 1A ). Normally the degree of pigmentation of RPE cells increases during the culture period, culminating when the cells become confluent, and returns less pigmented when they are replated at sparse density. It is also normal that even at the most confluent state, RPE cells show diverse degrees of pigmentation ( Figure 1A ). To characterize the cells with different degrees of pigmentation, 2304 cells of iPSC-RPE ( 96 cells each from two different dishes of 12 independent cultures of iPSC201B7-RPE and iPSC253G1-RPE cultured for 6 and 12 weeks; Figure 1—source data 1 ) were photographed under a light microscope ( Figure 1B photos ) and picked as single-cells by ALPS. The intensities of red, green, and blue channels were measured for each cell ( Figure 1B plots ). Because of the strong correlation ( r>0. 99 ) between the three channels ( Figure 1—video 1 ), we used the intensity of the blue channel, or the average intensity of the three channels ( so-called brightness ), as a proxy for the color intensity of each cell. The iPSC-RPE cells photographed and picked by ALPS were then subjected to RNA extraction followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. To compare the gene expression profiles of our iPSC-RPE lines with other commercially available RPE cells, human fetal primary RPE cells purchased from Lonza were photographed and picked by ALPS after cultured for 6 and 12 weeks as well ( Figure 1—source data 1 ). The t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t‐SNE ) plot of the transcriptomes of iPSC-RPE cells, Lonza-RPE cells together with undifferentiated human iPSCs and human fibroblasts showed our iPSC-RPE and Lonza-RPE in different clusters ( Figure 2A and B ). Although the parameters for t‐SNE were adjusted to have all the iPSC-RPEs ( iPSC201B7-RPE and iPSC253G1-RPE cultured for 6 and 12 weeks; Figure 1—source data 1 ) mingle regardless of the original iPSC-line or the culture period ( Figure 2A ), our iPSC-RPE was divided in four sub-clusters ( Figure 2B ). The major 2 clusters ( cluster-0 and –1 ) did not show critical differences in the expressions of key factors of the RPE ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) or the gene-ontology terms ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). Interestingly, cluster-8 consists of 32 cells showed the expression of proliferation marker MKI67 which was not expressed in other clusters besides cluster-4 that represented iPSC ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). Unlike iPSCs in cluster-4, the iPSC-RPE cells of cluster-8 did not show the expression of an iPSC-marker LIN28A ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) denying the possibility of cluster-8 being a residual of iPSCs after RPE differentiation. It could be possible that cluster-8 implies the existence of an adult stem cell population of the RPE. When the t-SNE plot was displayed with the color intensity of each cell, either deeply or lightly pigmented cells did not localize to a particular cluster ( Figure 2C ). Violin plots quantifying color intensities of the cells in each cluster showed all clusters having both dark- and light-colored cells ( Figure 2D ). Interestingly, Lonza-RPE showed biased distribution of cell color among the three clusters ( cluster-2, –3, and –7 ), having highly pigmented cells in cluster-2 and –3 but not in –7 ( Figure 2C and D ). These results indicated the degree of pigmentation of our iPSC-RPE did not associate with a specific gene expression profile defined by t-SNE. As no correlation between the color and gene expression profile was revealed in our iPSC-RPE by clustering analysis, next we sought the correlation of individual genes with the color of the cells. When each of the 280, 47 genes was analyzed for the correlation coefficient between its expression level and the color intensity in each cell, even for the gene with the highest positive- or negative-correlation with the color, the coefficient was 0. 565 and –0. 445, respectively ( Figure 3 ). The gene with the highest correlation was CST3 ( correlation coefficient 0. 565 ) that encodes cystatin C, a cysteine-proteinase inhibitor. As melanin, the material of the color, is cysteine-rich ( D'Alba and D’Alba and Shawkey, 2019 ), it is reasonable to have increased level of melanin under upregulated CST3 that inhibits cysteine-targeted degradation. Intriguingly, the expressions of the genes directly related to the production of melanin were not correlated with the color intensity of the cells ( Figure 3 ). These results suggest that the color appearance of iP-R cells may be a temporal condition that does not directly indicate the function of the R. 
The results of this study indicate that the degree of pigmentation of iPSC-R cells does not correlate with specific gene expression profiles. The color of iP-R cells may be a temporal condition that does not directly indicate the function of the R. The results also suggest the existence of an adult stem cell population of the R. The findings of this study have implications for the quality management of iP-R transplants for the treatment of degenerative retinal diseases such as AMD.

    Title: 
    Article: In recent years, the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ), due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans, has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ), a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities. Furthermore, MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism. 
 The study of animal behavior is essential for comprehending the intricacies of behavioral dynamics and their underlying cognitive processes. Exploring the neurobiological foundations of animal behavior enables the identification of shared neural mechanisms governing decision-making, learning, memory, and problem-solving throughout the broader spectrum of the animal kingdom. However, investigations of the neurobiology of ecologically valid behaviors can be extremely challenging using traditional approaches. With the rapid advancements in methods for recording and manipulating neural activity from these species, there arises a critical need to modernize our approaches to studying animal behavior to ensure they keep pace with the evolving neural techniques ( Miller et al., 2022; Huk et al., 2018; Scott and Bourne, 2022 ). There is growing recognition of the common marmoset’s ( Callithrix jacchus ) potential as an invaluable animal model in neuroscience research ( Miller et al., 2016; Burkart and Finkenwirth, 2015 ) as evidenced by efforts to create marmoset brain databases at multiple biological levels ( Lin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Woodward et al., 2018; Okano et al., 2016 ). Marmosets provide notable advantages as research models, including their immediate relevance to humans given their genetic relatedness and shared dominant sensory modalities ( Miller et al., 2016; Mitchell and Leopold, 2015 ), and their small size which facilitates naturalistic, freely moving studies of primate social behaviors that can be challenging with larger species like macaques. Further, they offer a distinctive platform for the study of social behaviors due to their significant parallels with human social structures. Marmosets are particularly prosocial and socially tolerant primates that, like humans, engage in pair bonding and cooperative breeding ( De la Fuente et al., 2022; Schaffner and Caine, 2000; French, 1997; French et al., 2018 ), which has been theorized to have significantly shaped socio-cognitive abilities. Indeed, marmosets consistently show more socio-cognitively advanced behaviors such as social learning, vocal communication, understanding and use of gaze cues, and cooperative problem-solving relative to non-cooperatively breeding primates ( Cronin et al., 2005; Burkart and Heschl, 2007; Hare et al., 2003; Burkart and van Schaik, 2010; Snowdon and Cronin, 2007 ). As primates, marmosets also share significant similarities to humans in their neural circuits involved in social cognition ( Miller et al., 2016 ). For example, both humans and marmosets show similar face-responsive brain regions in the temporal lobe ( Tsao et al., 2008; Hung et al., 2015 ) and similar brain networks comprising the social brain ( Deen et al., 2023; Cléry et al., 2021 ). Marmosets provide a unique opportunity to investigate social behavioral dynamics, however, being a relatively new model in the field of neuroscience, they have yet to benefit from the extensive methodological developments available for other model organisms like rodents. Continued innovation in research methods is essential to fully utilize marmosets as a model system to study complex behaviors and their neural correlates. Within the realm of animal behavior studies, investigating the dynamics of social interactions and decision-making presents both a challenge and a promising avenue for investigating complex cognitive processes. Advanced social cognition demands constructing and flexibly updating internal models of social agents and computing multiple layers of information across self and others ( Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003; Rilling and Sanfey, 2011 ). In particular, cooperation, a key behavioral strategy crucial to the evolution of advanced social cognition, involves integrating complex information like social relationships and the goals and intentions of oneself and others ( Brosnan et al., 2010; de Waal, 2008; Nowak and Sigmund, 2005; Lozano et al., 2020; Bliege Bird et al., 2018; Mustoe et al., 2016; Fehr and Rockenbach, 2004; Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Brosnan, 2011 ). Given the theorized role of cooperation in the evolution of higher-order cognitive processes involving processing and engaging in social interactions, studying this behavior can have important implications for understanding social dynamics, communication, and cognition in the animal kingdom ( Burkart and van Schaik, 2010; Burkart et al., 2014; Clutton-Brock, 2009 ). Traditionally, researchers have studied cooperative behaviors using the cooperative pulling paradigm, a widely employed experimental setup in several animal species that requires animals to collaborate to manipulate a device and retrieve a food reward ( Crawford, 1937 ). This paradigm involves two animals working in tandem, each pulling one end of a rope looped through rings attached to a heavy board on the ground. Because the food board is either too heavy for one animal to move alone or rigged so that one animal pulling the rope does not move the board, only coordinated actions can lead to successful food acquisition. This well-established paradigm has greatly contributed to our understanding of cooperative abilities across diverse species, including, but not limited to, chimpanzees, capuchins, hyenas, wolves, dogs, elephants, otters, and rooks ( Cronin et al., 2005; Crawford, 1937; Martin et al., 2021; Mendres, 2000; Plotnik et al., 2011; Range et al., 2019; Drea and Carter, 2009; Seed et al., 2008; Schmelz et al., 2017 ). While the cooperative pulling paradigm has been invaluable in shedding light on cooperative behaviors across a variety of species, it presents several limitations that hinder its utility for investigating complex behavioral dynamics and preclude studies of underlying neural mechanisms. One notable limitation is the relatively low resolution of behavioral output variables typically measured in the traditional pulling paradigm. Researchers often categorize outcomes in terms of broad categories of successful or unsuccessful cooperation attempts, which may not capture the nuances of behavior with the precision required for advanced analyses. Moreover, manual coding of animal behaviors within the task is constrained to second-by-second measurements and necessitates substantial human labor and expertise. Additionally, the traditional cooperative pulling paradigm requires frequent experimenter intervention to reset the apparatus’s position and reload it with food rewards between trials. This time-consuming process not only disrupts the natural behaviors of the animals but also limits the number of trials that can be conducted in each session, often allowing for only a meager sample size. For example, from a sample of five experiments employing a traditional cooperative pulling task across a range of species, animals performed, on average, 10. 4 trials per session ( Cronin et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2021; Mendres, 2000; Plotnik et al., 2011; Range et al., 2019; Drea and Carter, 2009; Seed et al., 2008 ), which poses a significant challenge for neural investigations. Furthermore, the manipulability of task variables is constrained in this manual setup, hampering researchers’ ability to investigate if and how specific factors influence cooperative behaviors in a controlled manner. Recent studies have explored alternative cooperative tasks to address some of these limitations, including the work by Jiang et al., 2021, which demonstrated the potential of using a nose-poking task to study cooperation in mice, rats, and tree shrews. This study highlighted the comparative abilities of cooperation across different mammalian species and provided a framework for developing more precise and controlled cooperative tasks. Building upon this work, we aimed to develop a task that not only captures the nuances of cooperative behaviors but also allows for high-resolution data collection, making it more suitable for integration with neural recordings. We designed the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MoAAP), a novel apparatus for studying cooperative behaviors in marmets that addresses the limitations of the traditional pulling paradigm. MoAAP enables high-throughput, detailed behavioral outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analyses in naturalistic settings. MoAAP also accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities and provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. Mo is a versatile and robust tool advancing our understanding of primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmets as a model.

    Title: 
    Article: Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions. 
 Alcohol consumption in pregnancy is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in children ( Popova et al., 2023 ). Alcohol can pass through the placenta acting as a teratogen in fetal tissues causing physical, cognitive, behavioural, and neurodevelopmental impairment in children at high doses with lifelong consequences for health ( Chung et al., 2021 ). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) and fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS ) can arise at binge levels of exposure, although not always at lower levels of exposure. Whether prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) is sufficient to induce overt physiological abnormalities depends on multiple environmental and genetic factors including the dose and timing of alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal diet, smoking, stress, and potentially other factors that collectively influence fetal outcomes ( Chung et al., 2021; Jacobson et al., 2021; Sambo and Goldman, 2023 ). Patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy vary, but epidemiological surveys suggest most women in Western countries consume low to moderate levels between conception until recognition of pregnancy ( Tsang et al., 2022 ), after which time consumption largely ceases, apart from occasional use ( McCormack et al., 2017 ). While the effects of binge levels of exposure are well documented as able to cause FASD, more subtle effects that reflect the more common patterns of drinking are unclear and more research is needed to support public health initiatives to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Studies suggest alcohol can disrupt fetal gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms ( Bestry et al., 2022 ). DNA methylation is one epigenetic mechanism involving the catalytic addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases within cytosine-guanine ( CpG ) dinucleotide motifs during one-carbon metabolism. Methylation of DNA can alter chromatin density and influence patterns of gene expression in a tissue-specific and developmentally appropriate manner and disruption to this process may cause some of the difficulties experienced by people with FASD ( Jin and Liu, 2018; Fransquet et al., 2016 ). Previous studies on human participants ( Lussier et al., 2018; Masemola et al., 2015; Jarmasz et al., 2019; Portales-Casamar et al., 2016 ) and animals ( Chen et al., 2013; Abbott et al., 2018; Downing et al., 2011 ) report that alcohol can disrupt DNA methylation either globally ( Jarmasz et al., 2019; Portales-Casamar et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2013; Abbott et al., 2018 ) or at specific gene regions ( Masemola et al., 2015; Abbott et al., 2018; Downing et al., 2011 ). Our recent systematic review, however, found limited replication of effects between studies suggesting the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation may be stochastic and influenced by numerous confounding factors ( Bestry et al., 2022 ). PAE can either directly inhibit DNA methyltransferase enzymes or disrupt one-carbon metabolism via inhibition of bioavailability of dietary methyl donors, such as folate and choline to the fetus ( Chen et al., 2011; Hutson et al., 2012 ). Choline, in particular, has been explored in several clinical trials to reduce cognitive deficits caused by PAE in affected individuals ( Nguyen et al., 2016; Wozniak et al., 2020 ), or when administered during pregnancy ( Jacobson et al., 2018; Thomas et al., 2009 ), with results suggesting a high methyl donor ( HMD ) diet could at least partially mitigate the adverse effects of PAE on various behavioural outcomes. Given the lack of clarity around the effects of typical patterns of alcohol consumption, which often do not cause observable phenotypes, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study of early moderate PAE in mice. Regions identified as sensitive to gestational alcohol exposure were replicated in human cohorts. The study was a controlled intervention investigating the impact of early moderate PAE on offspring DNA methylation comparing exposed and unexposed mice, with an additional arm comparing the effect of alcohol exposure in the context of an HMD maternal diet. The exposure period covers the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans when neurulation occurs, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition ( Tsang et al., 2022; Muggli et al., 2016 ). The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation and secondary outcomes of behavioural deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD were also examined. We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing ( WGBS ) for unbiased assessment of CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol ( Zakhari, 2006 ), to explore tissue specificity of effects and to determine any ‘tissue agnostic’ effects which may have arisen prior to the germ layers separating in early gastrulation. We also conducted candidate gene testing of regions identified in prior studies as sensitive to early moderate PAE. Our study provides cogent evidence that common patterns of drinking can have measurable effects on fetal gene regulation, highlighting a role for maternal dietary support in public health interventions. 
 To investigate the effects of early moderate PAE and an HMD diet across pregnancy on offspring DNA methylation and behavioural outcomes, we employed a murine model with four treatment groups. Treatment groups were designed to assess the effect of alcohol on offspring DNA methylation compared to control mice. An additional treatment group included a maternal diet high in methyl donors, with and without alcohol exposure ( Figure 1 ). The trajectory of weight gain during pregnancy was similar across all treatment groups with some evidence of more rapid weight gain in the HMD groups in the last 2 days ( linear mixed effects regression model; H2O-HMD: –2. 282±0. 918 g, p=0. 0177; PAE-HMD: –1. 656±0. 814 g, p=0. 0493; Figure 2a ), although the total amount of weight gained between days 1 and 17–19 was not significantly different between treatment groups by linear mixed effects regression ( Figure 2a and b ). The total amount of liquid consumed over the course of pregnancy was significantly lower in HMD dams by unpaired t-test ( Figure 2b and Figure 3c ). There was no significant difference in the average litter size ( 6. 525±0. 297 pups, Figure 2c ) and pup sex ratios ( Figure 2d ) between treatment groups by unpaired t-test. A subset of 16 newborn pups ( n=4 per treatment ) matched for sex and litter size were selected for WGBS. Both neonatal brain and liver were harvested to investigate the effects of early moderate PAE on fetal CpG DNA methylation. A total of 21, 842, 961 CpG sites were initially available for analysis. Global levels of DNA methylation stratified across different genomic contexts were preserved across treatment conditions, with no major differences in average DNA methylation content between groups ( Figure 4 ). To investigate region-specific effects of early moderate PAE on newborn DNA methylation, we conducted genome-wide testing comparing exposed and unexposed mice on the normal chow. We identified 78 differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) in the brain and 759 DMRs in the liver ( p<0. 05 and mean difference in methylation across the DMR with PAE ( delta ) >0. 05 ) from ~19, 000, 000 CpG sites tested after coverage filtering ( Figure 5a and b ). These regions were annotated to nearby genes using annotatr and are provided in Supplementary file 1a and b. Two of the DMRs overlapped in mouse brain and liver ( tissue agnostic ), but the remainder were tissue specific. Among these tissue agnostic regions was the Impact gene on chromosome 18, which had lower methylation in PAE+NC mice compared to H2O+NC mice in both brain and liver ( Figure 6 a and b ). Candidate gene testing of regions previously identified as sensitive to early PA in human studies were also examined in the murine model. In the brain, we observed lower methylation in PA+NC compared to H2NC mice in the promoter region of the gene ( Figure 7 a ). In liver, we observed lower methylation in PA+ compared to H mice in the promoter of ( Figure 7 b ). In the brain, we observed higher methylation in PA+ compared to H mice in the promoter of ( Figure 7 ) In the liver, we observed higher methylation in PA+ compared to mice in the promoter ( Figure 7 ) In the brain we observed lower methylation PA+ compared to H in the promoter of ( Figure 7 ) In the liver we observed lower methylation PA compared to in the promoter ( Figure 7 In the brain we

    Title: 
    Article: Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs. 
 Double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) can trigger the conserved mechanism of RNA interference ( RNAi ) to degrade mRNA of matching sequence ( Fire et al., 1998 ), and thus silence gene expression, in many organisms. This conservation has made dsRNA-based drugs useful in crops ( Das and Sherif, 2020 ), insects ( Vogel et al., 2018 ), and humans ( Zhu et al., 2022 ). While a dsRNA-based drug can be designed using just the mRNA sequence of any target gene, the intracellular effectiveness of the drug and the ease with which an organism could escape the drug by developing resistance are difficult to predict. Predicting both efficacy and susceptibility to resistance for each target could inform the selection of a suitable target from two or more equivalent candidates. Extensive characterization of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( reviewed in Seroussi et al., 2022 ) makes it a suitable system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A skeletal pathway that is required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA has been worked out in C. elegans ( Figure 1A ). Long dsRNA is imported through the transmembrane protein SID-1 ( Feinberg and Hunter, 2003; Winston et al., 2002 ), after which it is bound by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 ( Tabara et al., 2002 ), which recruits the endonuclease DCR-1 ( Knight and Bass, 2001 ) to cleave the long dsRNA into smaller dsRNAs ( Parker et al., 2006 ). The primary Argonaute protein RDE-1 ( Parrish and Fire, 2001; Tabara et al., 1999 ) cleaves one strand of the smaller dsRNA ( Steiner et al., 2009 ) and associates with the other, making it a 1° short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that can guide the recognition of target mRNAs of complementary sequence ( siRNAs; processing, pink ). After recognition by RDE-1-bound siRNAs, the target mRNAs are cleaved and the 5′ fragments are stabilized through the addition of 3′ UG-dinucleotide repeats ( Preston et al., 2019 ) by the nucleotidyltransferase RDE-3 ( Chen et al., 2005 ) to form pUG RNAs ( Shukla et al., 2020 ), which act as templates for the amplification of 2° siRNAs ( Pak and Fire, 2007 ) by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This amplification of silencing signals through the production of 2° siRNAs is facilitated by the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 ( Phillips et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011 ), the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 ( Yang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012 ), and their interactors ( Phillips et al., 2012; Uebel et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012 ). These 2° siRNAs are bound by one of several Argonautes ( Yigit et al., 2006 ), resulting in the eventual degradation of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm, which requires a cytoplasmic Argonaute, and/or co-transcriptional silencing of the target gene in the nucleus, which requires a nuclear Argonaute ( e. g., NRDE-3 Guang et al., 2008 in somatic cells ). Although it is difficult to compare the silencing of two different genes by controlling all relevant variables, past studies have highlighted gene-specific differences in the efficacy of RNAi under different conditions ( e. g., when RNAi is enhanced through the loss of the exonuclease ERI-1; Kennedy et al., 2004, when nuclear silencing is blocked in somatic cells through loss of NRDE-3; Raman et al., 2017, or when different concentrations of dsRNA are used; Zhuang and Hunter, 2011 ). Understanding the sources of such differences and the underlying mechanisms will improve our ability to design efficacious dsRNA drugs that are difficult to evade through the development of resistance. Here, we analyze the requirements for silencing two exemplar genes and use quantitative modeling to advance a parsimonious view of RNAi in somatic cells. We show that MUT-16, RDE-10, and NRDE-3 are each required for the silencing of bli-1, but any two of these proteins are sufficient for unc-22 silencing. These differences can be explained by differences in the thresholds for silencing the two genes using an intersecting network of regulators but not by parallel pathways of regulation after primary mRNA recognition. The requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA reveals several criteria for efficient RNA silencing. Insights from modeling led us to discover the influence of cis-regulatory regions on the requirements for RNAi, the recovery of animals from RNAi within non-dividing cells, and a dearth of pUG RNA production by 2° siRNAs. 
 To identify regulators of RNA interference ( RNAi ), we performed a primary screen for mutants that disrupt the maintenance of mating-induced silencing of a transgene followed by a secondary screen for mutants that are also defective in the silencing of endogenous genes by ingested dsRNA ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B ). Mating males with a transgene that expresses fluorescent proteins to hermaphrodites that lack the transgene can initiate silencing in progeny that lasts in descendants for hundreds of generations ( Devanapally et al., 2021 ), providing a stable strain that can be mutagenized to look for mutations that result in the recovery of expression from the fluorescent transgene. Of the 15 fertile mutants that showed re-expression, whole-genome sequencing followed by in silico complementation ( see Materials and methods ), revealed five mutants that had premature stop codons in mut-16 ( Figure 1B ), a known regulator of RNAi that is required for the production of secondary siRNAs ( Phillips et al., 2012; Uebel et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2011 ). MUT-16 is detectable in the germline localized within perinuclear foci, but it is also found throughout the soma ( Uebel et al., 2018 ). MUT-16 is required for the silencing of all tested somatic targets except the muscle gene unc-22, which showed residual silencing ( ‘+++’ vs ‘+’ but not ‘-’ in Zhang et al., 2011 ) consistent with its early identification as a sensitive target for RNAi ( Fire et al., 1998 ). While all five putative mut-16 mutants failed to silence the hypodermal gene bli-1 ( Figure 1C, left ), only four of the five showed unc-22 silencing ( Figure 1C, right ). Upon further analysis of the mutant that failed to silence unc-22, we found that this mutant also contained a missense mutation in RDE-10, another known regulator of RNAi that is required for the production of secondary siRNAs ( Yang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012 ). This missense mutation ( Ser228Phe ) is expected to disrupt the Maelstrom domain of RDE-10 ( Yang et al, 201; Zhang et al 2012 ) which is required for the interaction with MUT-16 ( Phillips et al, 2012 ) and the Argona NR-3 ( Yang et al 2012 ). R-10 is required for the silencing of unc-22 but not bli-1 ( Figure 1C ), consistent with its identification as a target for RNA ( Fire et al 1998 ). NR-3 is required for the silencing of bli-1 but not unc-22 ( Figure 1 ) consistent with its role in nuclear silencing in somatic cells ( Guang et al 2008 ). The requirement for NR-3 but not MUT-16 or R-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA ( Figure 1 ) suggesting that loss of NR-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. We conclude that MUT-16, R-10 and NR-3 are each required for the silencing of bli-1 but any two of these proteins are sufficient for unc-22 silencing, and that the requirement for NR-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. 
The study of RNA interference ( RNAi ) in the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans has revealed a complex network of intersecting regulators that contribute to the silencing of different genes. This network includes the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, the Mael domain-containing protein R-10, and the Argona protein NR-3, each of which are required for the silencing of some genes but not others. The requirement for NR-3 can be bypassed by enhanced processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NR- has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA during silencing by dsRNA reveals criteria for efficient silencing, including the influence of cis-regulatory regions, recovery of animals from silencing in non-div cells, and dearth of p RNA by 2 siRNAs.

    Title: 
    Article: Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) are common, primarily due to inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine the best predictors of death, utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ), and 30 healthy controls. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—were strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes. 
 Of 7. 1 million new tuberculosis ( TB ) cases in 2019, tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is estimated to have developed in 164, 000 adults, around 25% of whom were living with HIV ( Dodd et al., 2021 ). TBM is the most severe form of TB, causing death or neurological disability in half of all cases. Overall, TBM mortality is around 25%, but rises to around 50% in those with HIV, with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of treatment ( Dodd et al., 2021; Stadelman et al., 2020 ). The poor outcomes from TBM are strongly associated with the inflammatory response ( Wilkinson et al., 2017; Huynh et al., 2022 ), with both a paucity and an excess of inflammation linked to death from TBM ( Marais et al., 2017; Rohlwink et al., 2017; Thuong et al., 2017; Thuong et al., 2019; van Laarhoven et al., 2017; van Laarhoven et al., 2019; Cresswell et al., 2019 ). However, the mechanisms behind these observations remain uncertain. Immune responses in TBM are thought to be compartmentalized within the central nervous system. Studies have shown that immune cell counts, cytokine concentrations, metabolites and transcriptional responses differ between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) ( van Laarhoven et al., 2019; Rohlwink et al., 2019; Ardiansyah et al., 2023 ). In adults with TBM, leukocyte activation is higher in the CSF than in peripheral blood, although a marked myeloid response in peripheral blood has been reported ( van Laarhoven et al., 2019 ). Blood transcriptomic analysis has found increased neutrophil-associated transcripts and inflammasome signaling in those with HIV-associated TBM and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( Marais et al., 2017 ). In children with TBM, whole blood transcriptional profiles showed increased inflammasome activation and decreased T-cell activation ( Rohlwink et al., 2019 ). Taken together, these studies suggest the inflammatory response associated with TBM may have a greater systemic component than originally thought and its characterization may help define the immune mechanisms leading to death and disability. The accurate and early detection of patients at highest risk of complications and death from TBM may help to target treatment for those most in need. The British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) grades have been used to categorize TBM severity for almost 80 years ( Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Commitee, Medical Research Council, 1948 ), and the system strongly predicts TBM mortality ( Thao et al., 2018 ). Previously, we and others developed new prognostic models from studies of 1699 adults with TBM using clinical and laboratory parameters, including MRC grade ( Huynh et al., 2022; Thao et al., 2018 ). These models predicted outcomes more accurately than MRC grade alone. However, they might be improved by measures of host inflammatory response. Host-based peripheral blood gene expression analysis has been used to identify active or progressive pulmonary TB and in pulmonary TB treatment monitoring ( Sweeney et al., 2016; Penn-Nicholson et al., 2020 ), but has yet to be applied to TBM. In the current study, we investigated whole blood RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) transcriptional profiles in 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary TB ( PTB ), and 30 healthy controls. Our objective was to use weighted gene co-expression network analysis, an unbiased and well-evaluated approach, to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and assess the predictive value of gene expression for early mortality from TBM. 
 Four RNA-seq cohorts ( all ≥18 years ) were used in the study, representing a total of 606 participants. The characteristics of these cohorts are provided in Table 1. There were 281 adults with TBM; 207 HIV-negative and 74 HIV-positive. In the HIV-negative TBM adults, the median age was 46 years ( IQR 34, 58 ), 127 ( 61% ) were male, and the median Body Mass Index ( BMI ) was 20. 0 ( IQR 18. 2, 22. 3 ). HIV-positive TBM were more likely than HIV-negative TBM to be male, younger, have lower BMI, have previously received TB treatment, and to have microbiologically confirmed TBM. Total white cell counts in blood and CSF in HIV-positive TBM were lower than in HIV-negative TBM. Median CD4 cell counts in HIV-positive TBM was 67 cells/mm3 ( IQR 19, 124 ) and 28 ( 39% ) were under antiretroviral therapy. The PTB cohort consisted of 295 HIV-negative adults with the median age of 44 years ( IQR 31, 52 ), 228 ( 77% ) were male, the median of BMI was 19. 4 ( IQR 17. 7, 21. 6 ) and 129 ( 48% ) had pulmonary cavities on chest X-ray. Of the 30 healthy controls, 11 ( 37% ) were male, and the median age was 33 ( IQR 29, 37 ). In real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) validation cohort, 132 HIV-negative TBM adults have similar characteristics as HIV-negative TBM RNA-seq cohort ( Table 1 ). The clinical variables associated with three-month mortality of the 281 adults with TBM in RNA-seq cohort are given in Table 2. The discovery ( n=142 ) and validation ( n=139 ) cohorts had similar characteristics ( Table 2 ). 47. 3% ( 133/281 ) had definite TBM ( Marais et al., 2010 ), with microbiologically confirmed disease, accounting for 45. 9% ( 101/220 ) of survivors and 52. 4% ( 32/61 ) of those who died. The overall three-month mortality rate was 21. 7% ( 61/281 ) for TBM regardless of HIV status: 16. 4% ( 34/207 ) in HIV-negative and 36. 5% ( 27/74 ) in HIV-positive ( p<0. 001 ). We did not observe differences in mortality by sex, age and diagnostic category. Greater disease severity, MRC grades 2 and 3 at enrolment, was associated with increased mortality compared to grade 1 ( p<0. 001 ). In those who died, CSF and peripheral blood neutrophil counts were higher and peripheral blood lymphocyte count lower, compared to those who survived. In qPCR validation cohort ( n=132 ), 3-month mortality rate was 28. 8% ( 38/132 ) and those who died associated with older age, greater disease severity, lower number of CSF leukocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils, but did not differ in number of peripheral blood neutrophils ( Supplementary file 1A ). We analyzed the whole blood transcriptomics, using bulk RNA sequencing from 606 participants in the 4 cohorts. On average 35. 1 million reads/sample was obtained with 89. 4% reads mapping accuracy to human reference genome ( GRCh. 38 release 99 ) and 65. 4% reads were uniquely mapped. The study objectives and cohorts flow are presented in Figure 1. Principal component analysis on the transcriptomic data of 20, 000 genes across 4 studies showed different profiles between healthy controls from both PTB and TBM cases ( Figure 2A ) and between HIV-positive and HIV-negative TBM ( Figure 2B ). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCN) was used to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality. The WGN identified 1, 000 genes significantly associated with TBM and 1,000 with mortality ( Supplementary file 2 ). The top 10 hub genes associated with TBM are listed in Table 3. The top 10 genes associated with mortality are in HIV-positive and HIV-negative TBM are listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The top 4 genes associated with mortality in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative TBM are listed in Table 6. We used multivariate elastic-net regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap to choose best predictors. Neutrophil activation and decreased T-cell activation were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive, increased angiogenesis was associated with mortality, while HIV-negative exhibited TNF signalling and extracellular matrix organisation. Four genes—MMP1, N2, ZNF, and CD—were strong TBM predictors of mortality. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic response similar to PT, highlighting genes and pathways related to death, offering potential therapeutic targets and a novel biomarker for predicting outcomes.

    Title: 
    Article: Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins. It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines ( Laflamme et al., 2019 ) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, have demonstrated that: ( i ) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, ( ii ) yet, ~50–75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts. 
 Antibodies are critical reagents used in a range of applications, enabling the identification, quantification, and localization of proteins studied in biomedical and clinical research. The research enterprise spends significantly on the ~1. 6 M commercially available antibodies targeting ~96% of human proteins ( Bandrowski et al., 2023 ). Unfortunately, a significant percentage of these antibodies do not recognize the intended protein or recognize the protein but also recognize non-intended targets, with estimates that $0. 375 to $1. 75 billion is wasted yearly on non-specific antibodies ( Baker, 2015; Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015; Voskuil et al., 2020 ). Perhaps worse, the use of poor-quality antibodies is a major factor in the scientific reproducibility crisis ( Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015; Voskuil et al., 2020; Baker, 2020 ). With tens to hundreds of antibodies available for any given protein target, it is difficult for antibody users to select the best performing antibody ( Voskuil, 2014 ), and a growing number of cases reveal that depending on previously published antibodies is not a reliable method to assess their performance ( Laflamme et al., 2019; Sato et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Sicherre et al., 2021; Haytural et al., 2019; Virk et al., 2019 ). Academic and industry scientists aspire to have at least one, and ideally more, potent, selective and renewable antibody for each human protein for each of the most common applications ( Marx, 2020 ). Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon mechanism to determine, validate or compare antibody performance and there are multiple strategies for antibody validation ( Uhlen et al., 2016 ), with unequal scientific value. Most information on how commercial antibodies perform is anecdotal. It is thus difficult to assess progress toward the objective of well-validated antibodies for each human protein, or to design a strategy to accomplish this aim. We sought to address this issue by developing optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in the three most common uses of antibodies in biomedical research laboratories; Western blot ( WB ), immunoprecipitation ( IP ), and immunofluorescence ( IF ). We used these protocols to test antibodies against a variety of neuroscience targets, chosen by funders, to predict requirements for the larger goal of coverage of an entire mammalian proteome. The optimal antibody testing methodology is largely settled; using an appropriately selected wild type cell and an isogenic CRISPR knockout ( KO ) version of the same cell as the basis for testing, yields rigorous and broadly applicable results ( this study, as well as Laflamme et al., 2019; Ellis et al., 2023; Davies et al., 2013 ). However, the cost of antibody characterization using engineered KO cells is higher than that of other methods, mainly because of the cost of custom edited cells. Commercial antibody suppliers support a large and diverse catalogue of products, with most antibody products generating <$5000 in total sales, far less than the costs of KO-based validation, estimated at $25, 000. While leading companies are increasingly assessing antibody performance, it is exceedingly difficult, and cost restrained, to properly characterize all their products. Even when available, high-performing antibodies may remain hidden within the millions of reagents of unknown quality. To begin the process of large-scale antibody validation and to provide a large enough dataset to allow for more accurate estimates of the work and financing required to complete such a project, we began with the human proteome. We created a partnership of academics, funders, and commercial antibody manufacturers, including 10 companies representing approximately 27% of antibody manufacturing worldwide. For each protein target, we tested commercial antibodies, provided from various manufacturers, in parallel using standardized protocols, agreed upon by all parties, in WB, IP, and IF applications. All data are shared rapidly and openly on ZENODO, a preprint server. We have tested 614 commercially available antibodies targeting 65 proteins, and found that approximately two thirds of this protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant. This sample is large enough to observe several trends in antibody performance across various parameters and estimate the scale of the antibody liability crisis. 
 Our initiative has thus far validated antibodies for 65 protein targets, which were chosen by disease charities, academia, and industry without consideration of antibody coverage. The list is comprises 32 Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) -related proteins that were community-nominated through an NIH-funded project on dark AD genes ( https://agora. adknowledgeportal. org/ ), 22 proteins nominated within the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) Reproducible Antibody Platform project, 5 Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) -linked proteins nominated by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and 6 proteins nominated by industry ( Figure 1A ). Within the 65 target proteins, 56 are predicted intracellular and 9 are predicted secreted. The description of each protein target is indicated in Figure 1—source data 1. The proteins were searched to determine the Uniprot identifier, the predicted molecular mass, and whether the protein is secreted or intracellular ( Figure 1B ). Our strategy was predicated on identifying a parental cell line that expressed sufficient levels of the target protein to be detected by an antibody with a binding affinity of 1–50 nM. To identify candidate lines, we searched the Cancer Dependency Map Portal ( DepMap ) using the ‘Expression 22Q1’ database, which houses the RNA-level analysis of >1800 cancer cell lines ( Ghandi et al., 2019; Figure 1B ). After our initial experience with a few dozen targets comparing RNA expression and the ability to detect a clear signal, we selected 2. 5 log2 ( TPM +1 ) as an RNA-level threshold to select a candidate cell line to create a KO. Among the cell lines showing expression above this level, we prioritized a group of 8 common cell line backgrounds representing different cell/tissue types because their doubling time is short, and they are amenable to CRISPR-Cas9 technology ( Figure 1B ). These 8 cell lines were used in 62 out of the 65 antibody characterization studies ( Figure 1—source data 1 ). After identifying candidate cell lines for each target, we either obtained KO lines from our industry consortium partners or generated them in-house ( Figure 1C ). Antibodies were provided from antibody manufacturers, who were responsible for selecting antibodies to be tested from their respective catalogs ( Figure 1D ). Most antibody manufacturers prioritized renewable antibodies. The highest priority was given to recombinant antibodies as they represent the ultimate renewable reagent ( Marx, 2020 ) and have advantages in terms of adaptability, such as switching IgG subclass ( Andrews et al., 2019 ) or using molecular engineering to achieve higher affinity binding than B-cell generated antibodies ( Gray et al., 2020 ). All available antibodies from all companies were tested side-by-side in parental and KO lines. The protocols used were established by our previous work ( Laflamme et al., 2019 ) and refined in collaboration with antibody manufacturers. On occasion, our protocols differed from those the companies used in their internal characterization. All antibodies were tested for all three applications ( except that secreted proteins were not tested in IF ), independent of the antibody manufacturers’ recommendations. We received on average 9. 5 antibodies per protein target contributed from an average of five different antibody manufacturers ( Figure 1E, F and G ). Companies often contributed more than one antibody per target ( Figure 1F ). We found that more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications ( Figure 2A ) and that ~50–75% of protein was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application ( Figure 2B, C ) suggesting that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant. We also found that recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies ( Figure 2D ). Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of underperforming antibodies were reassessed by manufacturers and had alterations to their usage or were removed from the market. This study demonstrates the scale of the antibody problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome using the existing antibody repertoire and the data to focus new antibody generation efforts.

    Title: 
    Article: The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need, especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies. This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system. Here, we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome, FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Finally, using new compatible shRNA vectors, we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource. Together, these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. 
 Most reagents available for loss-of-function ( LOF ) and gain-of-function studies using RNAi or CRISPR rely on GAL4/UAS-mediated expression ( Brand and Perrimon, 1993; Dietzl et al., 2007; Perkins et al., 2015; Zirin et al., 2020; Port and Boutros, 2022 ). However, some studies, such as the study of intercellular or inter-organ communication, require the simultaneous use of two independent binary transcriptional systems. For example, dual expression systems have been used to study how a Drosophila insulin-like peptide released from the wing primordium communicates with the brain to control organ growth ( Colombani et al., 2015 ), analyze signaling from olfactory neurons to blood cells ( Shim et al., 2013 ), independently manipulate ligand-producing and ligand receiving cells ( Yagi et al., 2010 ), and visualize interactions between clonal cell populations in tissues ( Bosch et al., 2015 ). Based on the need to simultaneously manipulate different sets of cells in a given tissue, the LexA/LexAop system ( Lai and Lee, 2006 ) and the QF/QUAS system ( Potter et al., 2010; Potter and Luo, 2011 ) have been developed. There have been no systematic studies comparing the two systems, with only anecdotal evidence to support one system over the other. The numbers of available LexA and QF fly lines with tissue-specific expression domains are far lower than that represented by the thousands of GAL4 enhancer lines, which have been developed using various approaches over the past 25 years. The largest existing set of LexA system driver lines were produced by the Janelia FlyLight Project and Vienna Tiles Project ( Jenett et al., 2012; Tirian and Dickson, 2017 ). However, these lines were developed primarily for nervous system expression. Although they are often expressed in other tissues, they are not well suited for experiments targeting non-neuronal cell types. Furthermore, the FlyLight lines use a p65 transcriptional activation domain and therefore are not compatible with the GAL80 temperature-sensitive GAL4 repression system. A second large collection of ~180 LexA-based enhancer trap fly stocks has been generated ( the StanEx collection ) ( Kockel et al., 2016; Kockel et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2023 ). On average, each StanEx line expresses LexA activity in five distinct cell types, with only one line showing expression in just one tissue, unfortunately limiting usefulness of these reagents ( Kockel et al., 2016 ). These findings are consistent with prior studies indicating that enhancers very rarely produce expression patterns that are limited to a single cell type in a complex organism ( Jenett et al., 2012 ). Regarding the Q system, there are 101 total QF lines available from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( BDSC ). As the original QF can be toxic when expressed at high levels ( Potter et al., 2010 ), second-generation QF2 and QF2w, which are much less toxic and can be expressed broadly in vivo, were generated ( Riabinina et al., 2015 ). Among the 51 QF2 and QF2w lines available at BDSC, most are expressed in the brain, with relatively few of these drivers expressed specifically in other tissues. Thus, there remains an unmet need for more LexA and QF drivers with tissue-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, there are only ~260 LexA driver-compatible LexAop and ~130 QF driver-compatible QUAS stocks available at BDSC. The vast majority of these are to induce expression of fluorescent reporter genes, rather than molecular genetic reagents such as shRNAs for RNAi. This lack of fly stock reagents dramatically slows down studies that require two independent binary transcriptional systems, as custom fly stock reagents must be made by individual groups. Several methods have been developed to generate new drivers with well-established tissue-specific patterns. However, these methods require either de novo generation of new driver lines, as for the integrase swappable in vivo targeting element ( InSITE ) system ( Gohl et al., 2011 ), or PhiC31-induced insertion of a transcription factor cassette into an existing minos-mediated integration cassette genomic insertion ( Venken et al., 2011; Diao et al., 2015; Gnerer et al., 2015 ). CRISPR/Cas9 technology now makes it possible to knock-in a transcriptional activator into any locus. Some groups have also recently described tools to swap QF or LexA into the GAL4 coding region of existing GAL4 enhancer trap lines ( Lin and Potter, 2016; Chang et al., 2022; Karuparti et al., 2023 ). The conversion can be performed through genetic crosses; however, the frequency of conversion can vary greatly among different GAL4 lines, and many such swaps do not fully reproduce the original GAL4 expression patterns ( Chen et al., 2019 ). Despite these techniques, and the growing collection of LexA-GAD and QF2 lines, progress has been slow, and the choice of tissues depends on the specific interests of individual labs. Here, we describe the efforts of the Transgenic RNAi Project ( TRiP ) to facilitate combinatorial studies by building reagents that can be used alongside GAL4/UAS in a variety of tissues. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we targeted 23 genes to produce 44 new highly tissue-specific LexA-GAD and QF2 driver lines by CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair. We chose to use LexA with the GAL4 activation domain, rather than the p65 or VP16 activation domains to allow for temporal control by the temperature-sensitive GAL4 repressor, GAL80 ( Lai and Lee, 2006; Pfeiffer et al., 2010 ). We chose to use QF2 variant over the original QF, to avoid the toxicity reported for the latter ( Riabinina et al., 2015 ). Like GAL80-based modulation of LexA-GAD, QF2 activity can also be regulated temporally by expressing QS, a QF repressor. QS repression of QF can be released by feeding flies quinic acid ( Riabinina and Potter, 2016 ). Each knock-in was rigorously genotyped, and the expression pattern verified by imaging. Thus, we can systematically compare LexA-GAD vs QF2 activators inserted at precisely the same position in the genome. In addition to the new fly stocks, we provide a new set of vectors and protocols to efficiently generate LexA-GAD and/or QF2 drivers. This includes constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector, with each coding sequence flanked by FRT sites. Following successful integration into the fly genome, the vector generates a driver in which a target gene expresses both QF2 and LexA-GAD. If desired, one of the two coding regions can then be excised with Flp, resulting in flies that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, we evaluated both QF2 and LexA-GAD systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a compatible library of transgenic shRNA lines in our custom QUAS and LexAop vectors as a community resource. Together, these QF2/LexA-GAD and QUAS/LexAop vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. 
 We made each genetic driver line by inserting T2A-LexA-GAD or T2A-QF2 in the coding sequence of a target gene. We have previously reported the CRISPaint method to insert T2A-GAL4 into any gene using homology-independent repair ( Lin et al, 2017 ). We used the same method to insert T2-LexA-G and TQ2F into GAL4 enhancers. We targeted 23 genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, and generated 44 new Lex-GAD and Q2 lines by CRPR-mediated homology-directed repair. Each line was rigorously genotyped, and expression verified by imaging. We also built constructs that encode Q2 and Lex-G in a single vector, with each coding flanked by FRT. Following integration into the genome, the vector generates a driver that expresses both Q2 and Lex-G. If desired, one of the coding regions can be excised with FLP, resulting in flies that only express Q2 or Lex-G. We evaluated both Q2 and Lex-G systems for in vivo knockdown and generated a library of shRNA fly as a community resource. Our results show that both Q2 and Lex systems can be used for gene knockdown in vivo, and provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. We also provide a set of vectors and protocols to efficiently generate Lex-G and Q drivers, including constructs that encode Q and Lex in a single vector, each flanked by FRT. Following integration into the genome, the vector generates a driver that expresses Q and Lex. If desired, one of the coding can be excised with F, resulting in flies that only express Q or Lex. We evaluated both Q and Lex systems for in vivo knockdown and generated a library of shRNA fly as a resource. Our results show that Q and Lex can be used for knock in vivo and provide new tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two genes in an orthogonal in the same.

    Title: 
    Article: The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. Together, this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction. 
 Disruptions in synaptic structure and function have been identified as a major determinant in the manifestation of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability ( Hayashi-Takagi, 2017; Lepeta et al., 2016; Zoghbi and Bear, 2012 ). The need to understand how synaptic function is compromised in these disorders has accentuated the importance of studying the regulatory mechanisms of physiological synaptic function. These mechanisms involve cell adhesion molecules at both the pre- and post-synaptic side that act as synaptic organizers, whose unique combination determines the structural and functional properties of the synapse. Many such proteins have already been identified and our understanding of their complex role in synapse assembly and function has significantly increased over the last years ( de Wit and Ghosh, 2016; O’Rourke et al., 2012; Südhof, 2017 ). Furthermore, recent advances in the genetics of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders have implicated genes encoding for several of the known synaptic proteins, supporting a role for these molecules in the pathogenesis of corresponding disorders ( Südhof, 2021; Torres et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018 ). The sensitivity of the functional specification of the synapse to the combination of distinct synaptic proteins and their relative expression levels suggests that genetically encoded programs define at least facets of the synaptic properties in a cell-type-specific manner ( Südhof, 2017 ). Several of the synaptic proteins have been shown to promote formation of functional pre- and postsynaptic assemblies when presented in non-neuronal cells ( Dalva et al., 2000; Dean et al., 2003; Scheiffele et al., 2000 ), showing that their ability to specify synapses is in part independent of signaling processes and neuronal activity and supporting the idea that synaptic function is governed by cues linked to cellular origin ( Gomez et al., 2021 ). Thus, the investigation of synaptic organizers and their function in health and disease should be expanded to the transcriptional programs that regulate their expression. Bcl11b ( also known as Ctip2 ) is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been implicated in various disorders of the nervous system including Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease, and schizophrenia ( Kunkle et al., 2016; Song et al., 2022; Whitton et al., 2018; Whitton et al., 2016 ). Patients with BCL11B mutations present with neurodevelopmental delay, overall learning deficits as well as impaired speech acquisition and autistic features ( Eto et al., 2022; Lessel et al., 2018; Punwani et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020 ). Bcl11b is expressed in several neuron types, including the dentate gyrus granule neurons ( DGN ) of the hippocampus. Expression of Bcl11b in the DGN starts during embryonic development and persists into adulthood ( Simon et al., 2020 ). We have previously demonstrated that Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal learning and memory ( Simon et al., 2016; Simon et al., 2012 ). In the mature hippocampus, Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber synapses ( MFS ), the connections between DGN and CA3 pyramidal neurons ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ). MFS have a critical role in learning and memory stemming from their unique structural and functional properties, such as an enormous pool of releasable synaptic vesicles ( SV ), and reliable presynaptic short- and long-term plasticity ( Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005; Rollenhagen and Lübke, 2010 ). Conditional ablation of Bcl11b in murine DGN impairs presynaptic recruitment of SV and abolishes mossy fiber long-term potentiation ( MF-LTP; De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ). The molecular mechanisms, however, through which the transcriptional regulator Bcl11b controls highly dynamic properties of the MFS remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the secreted synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2, a member of the C1q-like protein family ( Yuzaki, 2017 ), is a functional target of Bcl11b in murine DGN. Reintroduction of C1ql2 in Bcl11b mutant DGN rescued the localization and docking of SV to the active zone ( AZ ), as well as MF-LTP that was abolished upon Bcl11b ablation. Knock-down ( KD ) of C1ql2 in wildtype animals recapitulated a major part of the MFS phenotype observed in Bcl11b mutants. Furthermore, we show that C1ql2 requires direct interaction with a specific neurexin-3 isoform, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ), a member of a polymorphic family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules ( Reissner et al., 2013; Südhof, 2017 ), to recruit SV in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we observe that localization of C1ql2 along the mossy fiber tract depends on C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction. Taken together, this study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of MFS function. Recent genetic studies suggested its single components to be associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate these molecules to be interconnected in one regulatory pathway. Thus, our findings provide new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of corresponding human disorders. 
 We demonstrated before that Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of adult excitatory hippocampal MFS ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018; Simon et al., 2016 ). The downstream regulatory mechanisms, however, through which Bcl11b exerts its complex functions at the MFS remained unclear. In a previous study, we carried out differential transcriptomic analyses on Bcl11b conditional knock-out ( cKO ) and wildtype ( WT ) DGN, to systematically screen for candidate transcriptional targets of Bcl11b ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ). Among the differentially expressed candidate genes, we identified the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ), previously implicated in modulating MFS functions ( Matsuda et al., 2016 ). C1ql2 transcript and protein levels are massively downregulated in Bcl11b mutant DGN ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1; De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ), and the Bcl11b protein directly binds to consensus sequences within the C1ql2 promotor ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ), suggesting Bcl11b to act on MFS through C1ql2. To directly test this, we stereotaxically injected a C1ql2-expressing AAV ( Figure 1a–b ) into the dentate gyrus ( DG ) of Bcl11b cKO mice 2 weeks after induction of the mutation and compared them to control animals. To avoid potential interference of the AAV-mediated gene expression with the interpretability of observed phenotypes, we stereotaxically injected the DG of control animals as well, with AAV expressing EGFP only. AAV-mediated re-expression of C1ql2 in the Bcl11b mutant DGN completely restored C1ql2 protein expression ( Figure 1c–d; Control +EGFP ) and SV localization to the AZ ( Figure 1e–f ) as well as rescued MF-LTP ( Figure 1g–h ) that was abolished upon B11 ablation ( Deyere et al. 2018 ). In contrast, AAV-mediated expression of a non-binding Cql mutant ( Cqlm ) in B11 mutant DGN did not rescue SV localization or MF-LTP ( Figure 1–i–j ). These results demonstrate that Cql is a functional target of B11 in DGN and that B11 regulates MFS through Cql. Next, we examined the role of Cql in the regulation of MFS in WT animals. We stereaxially injected AAV-Cql into the DG of WT mice and compared them to control animals injected with AAV-EGFP. AAV expression of Cql in WT DGN increased SV localization to the AZ ( Figure 2a–b ) and MF-LTP ( Figure 2c–d ) compared to control animals injected with A-EGFP ( Figure 2–e–f ). These results indicate that Cql is a positive regulator of MFS in WT DGN. To investigate the molecular basis of Cql regulation of MFS, we examined the interaction of Cql with presynaptic adhesion molecule Nrxn3 ( 25+ ), a member of the neurexin family ( Reiss et al. 2013; Süof 2017 ). Nrx3 ( 25+ is expressed in DGN and has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and learning ( Re et al 2013 ). We found that Cql directly interacts with Nn3 ( 25+ in vitro ( Figure 3a ) and in vivo ( Figure 3–b ) and that localization of Cql along the moss fiber tract depends on Cql-Nn3 ( 25+ interaction ( Figure 3–c ). To test the role of Cql-N3 ( 25+ interaction in regulation of MFS, we stereaxially injected AAV expressing a non-binding Cql mutant ( Cm ) into the DG of WT mice and compared to animals injected with AAV-EG. AAV expression of Cm in WT D did not increase SV localization or MF-L ( Figure 4–a–d ) compared to animals injected A-EG ( Figure 4–e–f ). Furthermore, we deleted N3 in DGN using CRISPRNA ( Figure 5–a ) and observed a significant reduction in SV localization and MF-L ( Figure 5–b–d ) compared to controls ( Figure 5–e–f ). These results demonstrate that Cql requires interaction with N3 ( 25 to regulate MFS. Finally, we examined the role of Cql-N3 25 interaction in B11 mutant DGN. We stereaxially injected AAV-Cql into the DG of B11 mutant mice and compared to animals injected A-EG. AAV expression Cql in B11 D did not increase SV or MF-L ( Figure 6–a–d ) compared to animals injected AEG ( Figure 6–e–f ). These results indicate that Cql-N3 interaction is not sufficient to rescue the M phenotype in B11 mutant DGN. Together, our data identify a novel B11/Cql/Nn ( 25+ )-dependent regulatory pathway that is essential for the control of MFS. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction.

    Title: 
    Article: To function effectively as an integrated system, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes. We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters, like most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ), probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ). We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that, following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that, following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined. 
 In the last decade, investigators have accumulated evidence for a direct cross-talk between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of gene expression. The dialogue between transcription and mRNA decay has been reported by several investigators, including us ( Begley et al., 2019; Blasco-Moreno et al., 2019; Bregman et al., 2011; Bryll and Peterson, 2023; Buratti and Baralle, 2012; Chattopadhyay et al., 2022; El-Brolosy et al., 2019; Gilbertson et al., 2018; Goler-Baron et al., 2008; Haimovich et al., 2013b; Harel-Sharvit et al., 2010; Hartenian and Glaunsinger, 2019; Ma et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2012; Timmers and Tora, 2018; Trcek et al., 2011; Vera et al., 2014; Zid and O’Shea, 2014 ). Often, this dialog results in ‘mRNA buffering, ’ which maintains an approximately constant mRNA level despite transient changes in mRNA synthesis or decay rates ( Haimovich et al., 2013b; Sun et al., 2012 ). In particular, communication pathways have been discovered between promoters and mRNA translation ( Chen et al., 2022; Vera et al., 2014; Zid and O’Shea, 2014 ) or decay ( Bregman et al., 2011; Trcek et al., 2011 ). However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. During transcription by Pol II, several RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs ) bind to nascent transcripts, thus modulating the transcription cycle ( Battaglia et al., 2017 ). Importantly, in some cases, RBPs remain bound to the mRNA, accompanying it to the cytoplasm and regulating post-transcriptional stages. For example, the Pol II subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7 bind to mRNAs and regulate their translation and decay ( Goler-Baron et al., 2008; Harel-Sharvit et al., 2010 ). We named the latter cases ‘mRNA imprinting, ’ because this binding imprints the mRNA fate ( Choder, 2011; Dahan and Choder, 2013 ). Although Rpb4 is a quintessential imprinted factor, it functions as a general factor that binds to numerous mRNAs ( Garrido-Godino et al., 2021 ). Imprinting by a ‘classical’ transcription factor ( TF ) that binds to specific promoters, thus regulating transcription by modulating the assembly of general transcription factors, including Pol II, is currently unknown. Such imprinting might broaden our understanding of the functions of TFs – not just transcription regulators but regulators of both the nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic post-transcription stages of gene expression. We previously reported a special case of cross-talk between promoter elements and mRNA decay which is mediated by Rap1 binding sites ( RapBSs ) and by Rap1 protein ( Bregman et al., 2011 ). RapBSs ( 12–14 bp ) are found in ~5% of the promoters, including ~90% of ribosomal protein ( RP ) and a small portion of Ribosome Biogenesis ( RiBi ) promoters ( Lascaris et al., 1999; Lieb et al., 2001; Shore et al., 2021; Warner, 1999 ). Rap1 is bound to essentially all such RP promoters in vivo ( Lieb et al., 2001; Schawalder et al., 2004 ) and is involved in their transcription activation. Rap1 functions as a pioneering transcription factor ( TF ) required for the binding of a pair of RP-specific TFs called Fhl1 and Ifh1 ( Lieb et al., 2001; Shore et al., 2021 ). An additional TF recruited by Rap1 is Sfp1 ( see next paragraph ). Previously, we demonstrated that Rap1 plays a dual role in maintaining the level of specific mRNAs – stimulating both mRNA synthesis and decay. We proposed that Rap1 represents a class of factors, synthegradases, whose recruitment to promoters stimulates ( or represses ) both mRNA synthesis and decay ( Bregman et al., 2011 ). How Rap1 stimulates mRNA decay is unknown. The split-finger protein 1 ( Sfp1 ) is a zinc-finger TF, the deletion or overexpression of which has been shown to affect the recruitment of the TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and Pol II to RiBi and RiBi-like genes, and to affect the transcription of RP and snoRNA genes ( Albert et al., 2019; Jorgensen et al., 2004; Marion et al., 2004; Fingerman et al., 2003 ). It also impacts many G1/S ( ‘START’ ) genes, where it appears to act as a repressor ( Albert et al., 2019 ). Sfp1 was, therefore, viewed as a classical TF. Shore’s lab has examined the Sfp1 configuration within promoters, using either chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP-seq ) or chromatin endogenous cleavage ( ChEC-seq ), and found that the two approaches exhibit different sensitivity to different configurations. While Sfp1 binding sites detected by ChEC are enriched for the motif gAAAATTTTc, binding identified by ChIP is dependent on Ifh1, hence on Rap1 as well ( Albert et al., 2019 ). Thus, Sfp1 can be viewed as a ‘classical’ zinc-finger containing TF. Zinc-finger domains have also been described to function as RNA-binding domains ( Font and MacKay, 2010 ). In some proteins, such as TFIIIA, the same zinc-finger domain can recognize both a specific double-stranded DNA sequence and another specific sequence in single-stranded RNA - discussed in Font and MacKay, 2010. In response to the misincorporation of nucleotides, damage to the DNA, nucleosomes, hairpins or certain DNA sequences, elongating Pol II transiently pauses. During pausing, Pol II remains catalytically active and can resume transcription if the obstacle is removed ( Bar-Nahum et al., 2005; Gómez-Herreros et al., 2012a ). However, these pauses increase the probability of Pol II backward movement along the DNA template, a process named ‘backtracking. ’ During backtracking, the 3’ end of the nascent RNA extrudes from the active site, traps the trigger loop of the enzyme, and stably blocks mRNA elongation ( Cheung and Cramer, 2011 ). Once arrested, Pol II can reactivate itself by cleaving its own synthetized RNA at the active site ( Sigurdsson et al., 2010 ). Cleavage is substantially enhanced by TFIIS ( Churchman and Weissman, 2011 ), which becomes essential under NTP scarcity ( Archambault et al., 1992 ). Important for this paper, Pol II backtracking is highly frequent at RP and RiBi genes, compared to other gene regulons, and is highly dependent on Rap1 ( Pelechano et al., 2009 ). Our previous work has also shown that several RP regulators, including Rap1 and Sfp1 modulate backtracking ( Breg et al. 2011 ). Here, we show that S1 binds to nascent mRNAs and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, S1 dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of back Pol. We propose that following promoter recruitment, S1 accompanies Pol and regulates back. back Pol is more compatible with S1 relocation to the nascent, where S1 accompanies mRN to cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, S1 co-transcription imprints mRNA, serving as paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay of mRN, and paradigm for dual-role zincinger proteins. The interplay S1 two modes of regulation remains to be examined.

    Title: 
    Article: Programmed cell death occurring during plant development ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. 
 Plant roots elongate by producing new cells in the root apical meristem at the root tip. As roots extend further into the soil environment, the newly formed root tissue is naturally exposed to microbial attack, challenging the successful establishment of root systems. However, microbial colonization at the meristematic zone is rarely detected ( Jacobs et al., 2011; Deshmukh et al., 2006 ). The sensitive tissue of meristematic stem cells is surrounded by the root cap, a specialized root organ that orchestrates root architecture, directs root growth based on gravitropism and hydrotropism, and senses environmental stimuli. In addition, the root cap is presumed to have a protective function in soil exploration ( Kumpf and Nowack, 2015; Moriwaki et al., 2013 ). In Arabidopsis thaliana ( hereafter Arabidopsis ), the root cap consists of two distinct tissues: the centrally located columella root cap at the very root tip and the peripherally located lateral root cap ( LRC ), which flanks both the columella and the entire root meristem ( Dolan et al., 1993 ). A ring of specific stem cells continuously generates both new LRC cells and root epidermal cells ( Dolan et al., 1993 ). However, despite the constant production of LRC cells, the root cap itself does not grow in size but matches the size of the meristem ( Kumpf and Nowack, 2015; Fendrych et al., 2014; Barlow, 2002 ). To maintain size homeostasis, root cap development is a highly regulated process that varies in different plant species. In Arabidopsis, a combination of dPCD and shedding of old cells into the rhizosphere has been described ( Kumpf and Nowack, 2015; Bennett et al., 2010 ). The centrally located columella root cap along with adjacent proximal LRC cells is shed as a cell package, followed by a PCD process ( Feng et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2018; Huysmans et al., 2018 ). In contrast, LRC cells at the distal end of the root tip elongate and reach the edge of the meristematic zone where they undergo dPCD followed by corpse clearance on the root surface, orchestrated as part of a terminal differentiation program by the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC33/SOMBRERO ( SMB; Fendrych et al., 2014; Bennett et al., 2010; Willemsen et al., 2008 ). SMB belongs to a plant-specific family of transcription factors carrying a NAC domain ( NAM - no apical meristem; ATAF1 and –2, and CUC2 - cup-shaped cotyledon ). SMB promotes the expression of genes associated with the initiation and execution of LRC cell death, including the senescence-associated bifunctional nuclease BFN1 and the putative aspartic protease PASPA3 ( Huysmans et al., 2018; Fendrych et al., 2014 ). BFN1 localizes in the ER, but upon cell death the protein is released and its nuclease activity ensures rapid and irreversible degradation of RNA and DNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm as part of a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance at the root surface ( Reza et al., 2018; Fendrych et al., 2014; Farage-Barhom et al., 2011 ). Accordingly, DNA and RNA degradation in bfn1-1 loss-of-function mutants is delayed ( Fendrych et al., 2014 ). Precise timing of cell death and elimination of LRC cells before they fully enter the elongation zone is essential for maintaining root cap size and optimal root growth ( Fendrych et al., 2014 ). Loss of SMB activity results in a delayed cell death, causing LRC cells to enter the elongation zone where they eventually die without expression of dPCD executor genes in the root cap ( Fendrych et al., 2014 ). Interestingly, the aberrant cell death of LRC cells in the elongation zone of smb-3 mutants is not followed by corpse clearance, resulting in an accumulation of uncleared cell corpses along the entire root surface ( Fendrych et al., 2014 ). Despite its importance in root morphology and plant development, little is known about the importance of dPCD and rapid cell corpse clearance on plant-microbe interactions. To address this question, we tested two well-characterized loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines, smb-3 and bfn1-1, during colonization with Serendipita indica, a beneficial fungus of the order Sebacinales. As a root endophyte, S. indica colonizes the epidermal and cortex layers of a broad range of different plant hosts, conferring various beneficial effects, including plant growth promotion, protection against pathogenic microbes and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses ( Boorboori and Zhang, 2022; Mahdi et al., 2022; Fesel and Zuccaro, 2016 ). The colonization strategy of S. indica comprises an initial biotrophic interaction, followed by a growth phase associated with a restricted host cell death that does not, however, diminish the beneficial effects on the plant host. The induction of restricted cell death in the epidermal and cortex layers is a crucial component of the colonization strategy of S. indica and is accompanied by an increased production of fungal hydrolytic enzymes ( Zuccaro et al., 2011; Deshmukh et al., 2006 ). The switch between the biotrophic and the cell death-associated phase can vary depending on the host system and environmental conditions, but has been postulated to occur approximately 6–8 days post inoculation ( dpi ) in Arabidopsis ( Zuccaro et al., 2011 ). Although several effector proteins involved in fungal accommodation have been described ( Dunken et al., 2022; Nostadt et al., 2020; Nizam et al., 2019; Weiß et al., 2016; Wawra et al., 2016; Akum et al., 2015 ), the exact mechanism by which S. indica manipulates host cell death and the role of dPCD in fungal accommodation in the roots are largely unclear. Here, we show that the accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses on the roots of smb-3 mutants triggers hypercolonization by S. indica, especially around the meristematic zone, and delays S. indica-induced root growth promotion. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization. 
 dPCD and corpse clearance are the final steps in LRC differentiation, maintaining root cap organ size in Arabidopsis root tips. This process is orchestrated by the LRC-specific transcription factor SMB and executed by its direct and indirect downstream targets ( Figure 1A ). To characterize the role of disrupted dPCD in Arabidopsis LRCs, we analyzed the phenotypic implications of the SMB loss-of-function allele smb-3 ( Willemsen et al., 2008 ). We employed two staining methods to visualize the extent of cell death and protein aggregation in the smb-3 T-DNA insertion line. We first used Evans blue staining, a viability dye that penetrates damaged/dying cells ( Vijayaraghavareddy et al., 2017 ). In smb-3 mutants, this staining revealed uncleared LRC cell corpses along the surface of primary roots, starting at the distal border of the meristematic zone ( Figure 1B and C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We further characterized smb-3 mutants with Proteostat staining, a fluorescent dye that binds to quaternary protein structures typically found in misfolded and/or aggregated and condensed proteins ( hereafter referred to as protein aggregates ) ( Vijayaravareddy et al, 2017 ). In smb-3 mutants, we observed aggregates in L cells of the elongation zone ( Figure 1D and Figure 1— supplement 1 ). In contrast, wild-type Arabidopsis roots did not show staining ( Figure 1E and Figure 1— supplement 1 ). These results indicate that loss of SMB leads to aberrant cell death of L cells in the elongation zone and accumulation of uncleared cell corpses on the root surface. To investigate the impact of uncleared corpses on S. indica colonization, we inoculated smb-3 and wild-type Arabid roots with S. indica ( Figure 2A and Figure 2— supplement ). After 7 dpi, we observed hypercolonization around the merist zone in smb- mutants ( Figure 2B and Figure 2— supplement ). In contrast, wild-type roots showed restricted colonization to the epider and cortex ( Figure 2C and Figure— supplement ). We quantified the extent of S. colonization by counting the number of fungal hyphae on the root surface ( Figure 2D and Figure— supplement ). At 7 dpi, the number of hyphae was significantly higher in smb- mutants compared to wild-type ( Figure 2D and Figure— supplement ). Furthermore, we observed a delay in S -induced root growth in smb- mutants ( Figure 2E and Figure— supplement ) compared to wild-type ( Figure 2F and— supplement ). These results suggest that uncleared LRC corpses on smb- mutants trigger hypercolonization by S., especially around the merist zone, and delay S -induced root growth. To investigate the role of BFN in S. colonization, we analyzed the expression of B1 in epidermal cells during S colonization ( Figure 3A and Figure 3— supplement ). We observed downregulation of B1 in mature epider cells in response to S colonization ( Figure 3 and Figure— supplement ). This downregulation was not observed in wild-type epider cells ( Figure 3 and— supplement ). To test the role of B1 in S colonization, we inoculated bfn-1 and wild-type Arabid with S. ( Figure 4 and Figure— supplement ) After 7 dpi, we observed restricted colonization to the epider and cortex in bfn-1 ( Figure 4 and Figure— supplement ) similar to wild-type ( Figure 4 and— supplement ). We quantified the extent of S colonization by counting the number of hye on the surface ( Figure 4 and— supplement ) and observed no significant difference between bfn-1 and wild-type ( Figure 4— supplement ). These results suggest that S downregulation of B1 in epider cells facilitates accommodation of S in the root. Our results demonstrate that dPC and corpse clearance play a role in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem and that beneficial microbes can modify host dPC processes to enhance colonization. 

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

The article investigates the connection between programmed cell death (PC) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SBR (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Seripita, primarily in the differentiation zone. SMB mutants exhibit hypercolonization around the merematic zone and delay S-induced root growth. The study shows that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcription analysis revealed B1 expression is downregulated during S colonization in mature epider cells, suggesting a transcriptional control facilitating accommodation of beneficial microbes in roots. The results demonstrate that microbes can modify plantPC processes to

    Title: 
    Article: Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease. 
 In neurodegenerative disease, prions and protein aggregates can transfer among cells of the nervous system to promote pathology spread ( Peng et al., 2020; Davis et al., 2018 ). Determination of the factors that enhance or deter pathological transfer is, therefore, a central goal in the effort to clinically address neurodegenerative disease. Study of aggregate transfer in the context of the mammalian brain is a major experimental challenge as events are rare, sporadic, and transiently apparent, and tissue is not easily accessible for in vivo observation. We model aggregate transfer by proteostressed ALMR touch receptor neurons in the living C. elegans nervous system ( Melentijevic et al., 2017; Cooper et al., 2021; Arnold et al., 2023 ), an experimental system that enables molecular and genetic manipulation and evaluation in a physiological context, directly through the transparent cuticle ( Corsi et al., 2015 ). More specifically, C. elegans adult neurons can extrude large vesicles called exophers ( ~5 µm; 100 X larger than exosomes ) that carry potentially deleterious proteins and organelles out of the neuron ( Melentijevic et al., 2017; Cooper et al., 2021; Arnold et al., 2023 ). Disrupting proteostasis via diminished chaperone expression, autophagy, or proteasome activity, or over-expressing aggregating proteins like human Alzheimer’s disease associated fragment Aβ1-42, expanded polyglutamine Q128 protein, or high concentration mCherry fluorophore, increases exopher production from the affected neurons. Neurons that express proteotoxic transgenes maintain higher functionality if those neurons produce exophers as compared to those that do not, suggesting that exopher-genesis can be neuroprotective, at least in young adult neurons. Extruded exopher contents can be transferred to neighboring glial-like hypodermal cells for content degradation in the lysosomal network ( Wang et al., 2023 ). Several mammalian models feature similar biology ( Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020; Lampinen et al., 2022; Davis et al., 2014; Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2021; Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2022 ), and thus we speculate that the basic transfer biology represents a conserved process that can be recruited for animal-wide proteostasis balance. Neuronal exophers are generated only in adult animals, with an unexpected pattern of a peak at young adult days 2–3 and then later in age with more variable onset ( Melentijevic et al., 2017 ). While using chemical regent 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine ( FUdR ) to block progeny production for aging studies, we found that blocking reproduction strongly limited the early adult peak of exopher production. Here, we report data that support that early adult exopher production is sensitive to the load of eggs in the reproductive tract. We document that uterine expansion, rather than chemical signals emanating from fertilized eggs, correlates strongly with the level of exopher production and suggest a model in which mechanical signaling, normally induced across generations from egg to parent via uterine stretch, is a license for proteostressed neurons to release potentially toxic materials in large extracellular vesicles. Mechanical signaling exerts a profound impact on virtually all cell types, and has been implicated in traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease, yet remains poorly understood ( Hall et al., 2021 ). Our observations direct enhanced experimental attention to studies on how mechanical force can influence extracellular vesicle formation and aggregate transfer in the living brain and in neurodegenerative disease. 
 In experiments originally designed to study exopher events in aging animals, we sought to generate age-synchronized populations by blocking progeny production from early adult stages using DNA synthesis inhibitor FUdR. Unexpectedly, we found that 51 μM FUdR strongly suppressed exopher events as quantitated at Ad2 ( Figure 1C ). FUdR is commonly used in C. elegans to inhibit the proliferation of germline stem cells and developing embryos, but has also been noted to impair RNA metabolism ( Burnaevskiy et al., 2018 ) and improve adult proteostasis ( Angeli et al., 2013 ). To probe which FUdR outcome might confer exopher suppression, we first addressed whether disruption of progeny production by alternative genetic means might suppress exophergenesis, which would implicate a viable germline as a factor in exopher modulation. In the assembly line-like hermaphrodite C. elegans gonad, germline stem cells close to the signaling distal tip cell ( DTC ) proliferate by mitosis ( diagram of C. elegans gonad and germ cell development in Figure 1D ). We disrupted germ cell production using the glp-4 ( bn2ts ) valyl-tRNA synthetase 1 mutant. At the restrictive temperature ( 25 °C ), glp-4 ( bn2ts ) causes germ cell arrest during the initial mitotic germ cell divisions, effectively eliminating the germline ( Beanan and Strome, 1992 ). We constructed an mCherryAg2; glp-4 ( bn2ts ) strain and quantitated ALMR exopher production in animals grown at the restrictive temperature, scoring exophers during early adulthood ( Figure 1E ). ALMR neurons in the germline-less glp-4 mutant produced significantly fewer exophers on Ad1-4 as compared to age- and temperature-matched controls. Given that lack of functional germ cells impaired neuronal exopher production, we sought to test whether oocytes or sperm might be specifically required for exophergenesis, taking advantage of C. elegans genetic reagents available for the manipulation of gamete development. The requirement of sperm and oocytes for neuronal exopher production raises the obvious question as to whether fertilized eggs/embryos are required for ALMR exophergenesis ( Figure 1I ). C. elegans genes impacting fertilization and embryonic development have been studied in exquisite detail ( Greenstein, 2005; Stein and Golden, 2018; Rose and Gönczy, 2014; Schneider and Bowerman, 2003 ). We tested embryonic development genes known for roles at particular stages for impact on neuronal exopher levels using RNAi knockdown approaches. In C. elegans fertilization, as the mature oocyte encounters the sperm-filled spermatheca, a single sperm enters the mature ovulated oocyte ( fertilization time 0 ), triggering the rapid events of egg activation, which include polyspermy block, eggshell formation, completion of meiotic divisions and extrusion of polar bodies. The multi-step eggshell formation ( Figure 2A ) is completed within 5 min of sperm entry, by which time the zygote has been passed into the uterus, where the maternal chromosomes execute both meiotic divisions ( meiosis accomplished by ~20 min after fertilization ). After the establishment of egg polarity cues, the first mitotic cell division occurs ~40 min after fertilization ( Stein and Golden, 2018; Schneider and Bowerman, 2003 ). Eggs are held in the mother’s uterus until they are laid at the ~30- cell stage ( gastrulation ). In wild-type, ~8 fertilized eggs occupy the uterus when egg laying begins at ~6 hr of adult life ( Medrano and Collins, 2023 ). Our data revealed an unexpected theme: we found that disruption of tested early-acting genes essential for eggshell formation ( eglp-1, egl-2,gl-3,gl-4,gl-5,gl-6,gl-7,gl-8,gl-9,gl-10,gl-11,gl-12,gl-13,gl-14,gl-15,gl-16,gl-17,gl-18,gl-19,gl-20,gl-21,gl-22,gl-23,gl-24,gl-25gl-26gl-27gl-28gl-29gl-30gl-31-32gl-33-34gl-35gl-36-37gl-38-39gl-40gl-41-42gl-43-44gl-45-46-47-48-49-50-51-52-53-54-55-56-57-58-59-60-61-62-63-64-65-66-67-68-69-70-71-72-73-74-75-76-77-78-79-80-81-82-83-84-85-86-87-88-89-90-91-92-93-94-95-96-97-98-99-100-101-102-103-104-105-106-107-108-109-110-111-112-113-114-115-116-117-118-119-120-121-122-123-124-125-126-127-128-129-130-131-132-133-134-135-136-137-138-139-140-141-142-143-144-145-146-147-148-149-150-151-152-153-154-155-156-157-158-159-160-161-162-163-164-165-166-167-168-169-170-171-172-173-174-175-176-177-178-179-180-181-182-183-184-185-186-187-188-189-190-191-192-193-194-195-196-197-198-199-200-201-202-203-204-205-206-207-208-209-210-211-212-213-214-215-216-217-218-219-220-221-222-223-224-225-226-227-228-229-230-231-232-233-234-235-236-237-238-239-240-241-242-243-244-245-246-247-248-249-250-251-252-253-254-255-256-257-258-259-260-261-262-263-264-265-266-267-268-269-270-271-272-273-274-275-276-277-278-279-280-281-282-283-284-285-286-287-288-289-290-291-292-293-294-295-296-297-298-299-300-301-302-303-304-305-306-307-308-309-310-311-312-313-314-315-316-317-318-319-320-321-322-323-324-325-326-327-328-329-330-331-332-333-334-335-336-337-338-339-340-341-342-343-344-345-346-347-348-349-350-351-352-353-354-355-356-357-358-359-360-361-362-363-364-365-366

    Title: 
    Article: Increasing evidence supports a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ). Studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in AD patients. Here, we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models, extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice. Collectively, our findings identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. 
 Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) is the most common form of dementia in the aging population. The disease is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction and loss, early signatures that correlate with cognitive decline in AD and precede both neuronal death and the onset of severe dementia by at least 10 years ( Mucke and Selkoe, 2012; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016 ). Current AD models suggest that amyloid-β ( Aβ ) initiates a pathophysiological cascade leading to synapse failure and eventually cognitive decline. Although the primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, soluble Aβ oligomers ( Aβo ) are considered one of the key toxic proteins driving synapse dysfunction ( Mucke and Selkoe, 2012; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Walsh et al., 2002 ). However, the exact mechanisms by which Aβo impair synapse function and cause their degeneration are not fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that Wnt signaling is compromised in AD, contributing to synapse degeneration. Wnts are secreted proteins that play a crucial role in synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and synapse integrity ( McLeod and Salinas, 2018 ). The canonical Wnt pathway is particularly impaired in AD. For example, levels of the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 ( DKK1 ) are increased in the brain of AD patients and AD models ( Caricasole et al., 2004; Purro et al., 2012; Rosi et al., 2010 ). DKK1 promotes synapse degeneration and its blockade protects against Aβ-induced dendritic spine and synapse loss ( Marzo et al., 2016; Purro et al., 2012; Sellers et al., 2018 ). Supporting the role of deficient Wnt signaling in AD, three genetic variants of LRP6, a crucial Wnt co-receptor, are linked to late-onset AD and confer decreased Wnt signaling in cell lines ( Alarcón et al., 2013; De Ferrari et al., 2007 ). Notably, mice carrying the Lrp6-Valine variant exhibit increased synapse vulnerability during aging and in AD ( Jones et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, loss-of-function of Lrp6 exacerbates amyloid pathology in an AD mouse model ( Liu et al., 2014 ). In addition, Frizzled-1 ( Fz1 ) and Fz7, Wnt receptors present at synapses, are downregulated in the hippocampus of AD subjects and AD models ( Palomer et al., 2022 ). However, the molecular mechanisms by which deficient Wnt signaling contributes to synaptic defects in AD are poorly understood. Importantly, it remains unexplored whether amelioration of Wnt deficiency restores synaptic connectivity and memory in AD. Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ), a member of the secreted Wnt antagonist DKK family, could contribute to AD pathogenesis. Like other DKKs, DKK3 has two cysteine-rich domains but it also contains an elongated N-terminus with a Soggy domain ( Krupnik et al., 1999; Niehrs, 2006 ). Although studies suggest that DKK3 antagonizes the Wnt canonical pathway ( Caricasole et al., 2003; Mizobuchi et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2014 ), the function of DKK3 in the adult brain is unclear. Dkk3 knock-out mice are viable and do not exhibit morphological alterations in the brain, but female mice manifest hyperlocomotion ( Barrantes et al., 2006 ). Recent findings indicate that DKK3 is increased in plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ), and accumulates in Aβ plaques in the human AD brain ( Bruggink et al., 2015; Drummond et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2019 ). However, the impact of DKK3 on synapses and cognitive function, which are affected by deficient Wnt signalling ( Jones et al., 2023; Marzo et al., 2016 ), in AD remains to be studied. Studies on DKK3 in AD would shed new light on the mechanisms that contribute to synapse vulnerability in AD. Here, we investigate the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. Our RNAseq analyses reveal that DKK3 expression is increased in the brains of AD patients. Consistently, we found that DKK3 protein is increased in the human AD brain from early stages of the disease. In two AD mouse models, extracellular DKK3 is increased in the hippocampus before substantial plaque deposition. As the pathology progresses in the mouse AD brain, DKK3 accumulates in dystrophic neurites around amyloid plaques. Functionally, our confocal and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that increased levels of DKK3 trigger the loss of excitatory synapses with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus through different Wnt pathways. Crucially, in vivo downregulation of DKK3 ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic defects in the hippocampus and improves memory in an AD mouse model. Together, our findings in humans and functional studies in mice identify DKK3 as a driver of synapse pathology and cognitive impairment in AD. 
 A previous study found that DKK3 is present in Aβ plaques in the brain of AD patients ( Bruggink et al., 2015 ). To investigate whether DKK3 is increased in AD, we examined the expression of DKK3 in the AD brain using RNA-seq data from the ROSMAP ( De Jager et al., 2018 ), MSBB ( Wang et al., 2018 ), and MayoRNAseq ( Allen et al., 2016 ) datasets ( n=248 controls, 379 AD cases ). Logistic regression analyses revealed that DKK3 was upregulated in AD cases ( regression β-coefficient=0. 31; p-value = 1. 52 × 10–3 ). In addition, ordinal regression analyses showed that DKK3 was differentially expressed in relation to Braak scores, a measure of neurofibrillary tangle pathology ( Braak et al., 2006; regression β-coefficient=0. 27; p-value = 8. 84 × 10–4 ), but not to CERAD scores, a measure of neuritic plaque density ( Mirra et al., 1991; regression β-coefficient: 0. 07; p-value = 0. 43; Figure 1A ). These results indicate that the expression of DKK3 is increased in the brain of human AD patients. We next assessed DKK3 protein levels in the hippocampus of AD patients at different disease stages based on their Braak status. We evaluated healthy individuals and patients with Braak stages I-III and IV-VI ( n=16 per group, Supplementary file 1 ). Given that DKK3 is found at Aβ plaques in the human AD brain ( Bruggink et al., 2015; Drummond et al., 2017 ), we analyzed DKK3 protein in the soluble and insoluble fractions. Soluble DKK3 levels were increased in Braak I-III patients when compared to control subjects ( 1. 4-fold increase ), but no changes were observed in Braak IV-VI ( Figure 1B ). In the insoluble fraction, in contrast, DKK3 protein levels were increased in Braak IV-Vl ( 1. 51-fold increase; Figure 1C ), which could be consistent with the presence of DKK3 in Aβ plaques. To explore if DKK3 increases at early stages of AD, we assessed DKK3 abundance in brain tissue from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using a published proteomic study comprised of 106 controls, 182 AD cases, and 200 asymptomatic carriers of the APOE4 allele ( Wang et al,2018 ). We found that D3 protein levels were higher in APO4 carriers ( 1.3-fold ) and AD cases (1.5-fold ) compared to controls ( Figure 1D ). These results suggest that D3 is upregulated in the brain early stages of AD. To determine if D3 accumulates in dystrophic neurites around amyloid plaques, we used immunohistochemistry to detect D3 in the hippocampus of hAPP-J20 and hAPP-NL-G/N-G mouse models of AD. We found that extracellular D3 is increased in the hippocampus before plaque deposition ( Figure 2A ) and accumulates in dystrophic neurites around amyloid plaques as pathology progresses ( Figure 2B ). To investigate the function of D3 in synapses, we used confocal microscopy and electrophysiology to examine the effect of D3 on excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus. We found that D3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses with concomitant increase in inhibitory syn ( Figure 3 ) through blockade of the Wnt/GSKβ pathway and activation of the W/JNK pathway ( Figure 4 ). In contrast, downregulation of D3 restores excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus and improves memory in hAPP-J20 mice ( Figure 5 ). These findings indicate that D3 is a driver of synapse and cognitive impairment in AD. 
The study aimed to investigate the role of DKK in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. RNAseq analyses revealed that D3 expression is increased in the brains of AD patients. Consistently, we found D3 protein is increased in human brain from early stages the disease. In two AD models extracellular D3 is increased hippocampus before plaque. As pathology progresses mouse brain D3 accumulates dystrophic neurites around amyloid plaques. Functionally confocal electrophys studies that D3 triggers loss excitatory syn with conitant increase inhibitory syn through W pathways. Crucially in vivo D3 downregulation ameliorates excitatory inhibitory defects hippocampus improves memory AD model. Together findings identify D3 driver syn pathology cognitive impairment AD.

    Title: 
    Article: The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens. 
 There are approximately 4. 95 million fatalities associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria worldwide each year ( Murray et al., 2022 ). This high mortality rate contrasts with the low development rate of new antibacterial agents for clinical applications ( WHO, 2022; Beyer and Paulin, 2020 ). Thus, the development of alternative therapies with higher sustainability to counteract the rapidly dwindling treatment options due to resistance evolution is imperative ( Bell and MacLean, 2018; Monserrat-Martinez et al., 2019; Rezzoagli et al., 2020b ). Numerous alternative approaches have been proposed, including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides and nanobodies, antivirulence treatments to disarm pathogens, treatments that capitalize on ecological competition between susceptible and resistant bacteria, and the search for new antibacterial compounds produced by environmental microbes ( Bhushan et al., 2017; Ghosh et al., 2019; Mei et al., 2022; Rezzoagli et al., 2020a; Saeki et al., 2020; Wale et al., 2017 ). Mining natural microbial communities has become a promising endeavor in the hunt for novel antimicrobials because most microbes deploy bioactive compounds to contend with their competitors in the diverse assemblies they live in. Competition often involves the secretion of secondary metabolites with specific antimicrobial properties against other microbes ( Hug et al., 2020 ). The isolation, characterization, and synthesis of such secondary metabolites can result in novel prospective antibiotics for clinical applications ( Imai et al., 2019; Ling et al., 2015 ). Secondary metabolites that act as toxins to kill competitors are often considered promising candidates. However, microbes compete through a variety of mechanisms other than toxins. For example, there is increasing evidence that competition for iron is a main determinant of species interactions in soil and freshwater communities ( Butaitė et al., 2017; Deveau et al., 2016 ). Competition for iron involves the secretion of siderophores, a class of secondary metabolites that scavenges environmental iron with high affinity ( Hider and Kong, 2010 ). Because siderophores are often species specific, they have two opposing effects: they make iron available for related community members possessing the matching receptor but withhold iron from competitors with non-matching receptors. Thus, siderophores can be competitive agents in inter-species interactions ( Figueiredo et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2012; Niehus et al., 2017 ). Here, we apply the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens. Specifically, we investigate whether siderophores from non-pathogenic environmental bacteria can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens. We focus on pyoverdines, a class of siderophores with high iron affinity that are produced and secreted by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. under iron-limited conditions ( Visca et al., 2007 ). Upon complexation with ferric iron, the iron-loaded pyoverdine is imported into the cell by receptors with high specificity and subsequently reduced to the bio-available ferrous iron ( Bonneau et al., 2020; Cornelis et al., 2023 ). Pyoverdines show an extraordinary structural diversity with more than 70 described variants that differ in their peptide backbone ( Meyer et al., 2008; Rehm et al., 2022 ) and have an extremely high affinity for iron ( Ka = 1032 M–1, pyoverdine produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens biotype B ) ( Meyer and Abdallah, 1978 ). For these reasons, we propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition. To test our hypothesis, we screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains, isolated from soil and freshwater habitats, for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, we elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition. Subsequently, we assessed the efficacy of the three top pyoverdine candidates against four human opportunistic pathogens ( Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus ) in vitro and/or in vivo via infections of the Greater wax moth larvae ( Galleria mellonella ). We further assessed their toxicity in the host, toward two mammalian cell lines and red blood cells. Finally, we used experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing to study the potential of pathogens evolving resistance against pyoverdine treatment. 
 To assess the antibacterial properties of pyoverdines, we performed a growth inhibition screen using a well-characterized collection of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates ( Butaitė et al., 2017; Butaitė et al., 2018; Butaitė et al., 2021; Kramer et al., 2020 ). The isolates stem from freshwater and soil communities and belong to the group of fluorescent pseudomonads ( e. g., P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. syringae, P. chlororaphis ) that are non-pathogenic to humans and can produce and secrete pyoverdines, a group of high iron-affinity siderophores ( Meyer, 2000 ). Important to note is that several isolates are likely to produce secondary siderophores in addition to pyoverdine ( Cornelis, 2010 ). Given that secondary siderophores generally have lower iron affinity than pyoverdine, we anticipate treatment effects to be primarily driven by pyoverdines. In a first screen, we evaluated how the sterile pyoverdine-containing supernatants of the 320 isolates affect the growth of 12 human opportunistic pathogens ( Table 1 ). Specifically, we grew the pathogens in 70% fresh casamino acid medium ( CAA ) supplemented with 30% spent supernatant. We found high variation in the supernatant effect, ranging from complete pathogen growth inhibition to growth promotion compared to the control treatment ( 70% CAA supplemented with 30% sodium chloride 0. 8% solution ) ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). The mean supernatant effect across all pathogens showed a bimodal distribution with two peaks at 0. 47–0. 58 ( approximately 50% growth inhibition ) and 1. 00–1. 10 ( no growth inhibition ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). Our observations are consistent with previous studies, in which supernatants containing siderophores can have both growth inhibitory and stimulatory effects ( Gu et al., 2020; Butaitė et al., 2018 ). For each supernatant, we quantified the number of pathogens that experienced a growth reduction of at least 20% compared to the control and found that 25 supernatants inhibited all 12 pathogens ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ). To confirm that the growth-inhibiting properties of the 25 most potent supernatants are indeed caused by pyoverdines and not by other agents in the supernatant, we repeated the above assay, but this time supplemented the supernatant with 40 µM FeCl3. Under such iron-replete conditions, pyoverdines ( and secondary siderophores ) should not be able to substantially sequester environmental iron, and pathogen growth should therefore be restored. We identified seven top candidate supernatants for which a relative growth recovery of at least 0. 2 occurred for all 12 pathogens ( Figure 1B ). Among the remaining 18 supernatants, the overall rate of growth recovery was also high, indicating that pyoverdines are responsible for pathogen growth inhibition under iron-limited conditions ( Figure 1— supplement 1D ). The seven top supernants were selected for further analysis of their pyd content and chemical diversity. We isolated the pyd from the supernatants using HPLC and characterized the chemical structure using NMR and MS ( Figure 2, Figure 2— supplement 1 ). We found that the pyd differ in their peptide backbone and side chains ( Figure 2, Figure— supplement 2 ). The top three pyd candidates were selected for their efficacy against four opportunistic pathogens ( Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, Pseud aeruginosa, and Stylococcus aureus ) in vitro and/or in vivo infections of Galleria mellella larvae ( Figure 3, Figure 3— supplement 1, Figure 3— supplement 2, Figure 3— supplement 3 ). The most potent pyd reduced the growth of all four pathogens in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3A, Figure 3— supplement 1 ). The IC50 of the most potent pyd against Acobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Styloc aureus were 0. 1–0. 1 µM ( Figure 3B, Figure— supplement 1 ). In contrast, the IC50 against Pseud aeruginosa was 0.5 µM ( Figure 3,— supplement ) The pyd also increased survival of infected Galler mellella larvae ( Figure 3, Figure— supplement 2 ) and showed low toxicity toward mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes ( Figure 3,— supplement 3 ) Finally, we assessed the potential of pathogens to evolve resistance against pyd treatment using experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing ( Figure 4, Figure— supplement 1, Figure 4— supplement ). We found limited evolution of resistance compared to antibiotic treatment ( Figure 4,— supplement ) indicating that pyd from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against human pathogens.
The article discusses the potential of using siderophores, specifically pyoverines, produced by non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. to inhibit the growth of opportunistic human pathogens. The study screened 320 Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens and found several pyines with high antibacterial properties. The most potent pyine reduced the growth of Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Staphlococcus aureus in a concentration-dependent manner. The py also increased survival of infected Gallerella larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance compared to antibiotic.

    Title: 
    Article: Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level. This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia. To address that question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists. As such, our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. 
 NMDAR synaptic malfunction has been implicated as causal in schizophrenia ( Fromer et al., 2014; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014; Timms et al., 2013 ), and loss of NMDAR synaptic function in prefrontal networks is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits as well as clinical symptoms in the disease ( Goldman-Rakic, 1999; Javitt et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 ). However, we do not have a complete understanding of how NMDAR synaptic mechanisms influence neural dynamics in prefrontal networks, nor how the disruption of NMDAR synaptic mechanisms might cause prefrontal networks to malfunction. To address these questions, we recently investigated how blocking NMDAR altered neural dynamics and effective communication between neurons in prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a cognitive control task measuring deficits in schizophrenia ( Blackman et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2010; Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2018 ). We found that reducing NMDAR synaptic communication reduced the frequency of synchronous ( ‘0-lag’ ) spiking between neurons, as well as effective communication between neurons on timescales consistent with monosynaptic interactions between them ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ). Whereas these studies suggested that NMDAR synaptic function and spike timing in prefrontal networks were linked, they did not elucidate the circuit mechanisms responsible. In the current study, we developed a spiking neural network model to understand mechanisms that might mediate the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics ( reduced 0-lag synchronous spiking ) we observed in biological data ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ). The network is comprised of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons embedded in a sparsely connected recurrent network employing realistic NMDAR, GABAR, and AMPAR mediated synaptic currents. We use network stability and mean field analyses to investigate how the balance between NMDA and AMPA components of recurrent excitatory and GABA inhibitory currents influence regimes of network dynamics and spiking synchrony. For cortical neurons synchrony can occur naturally due to the local recurrent network connectivity, even when external afferent inputs are entirely uncorrelated. Theoretical studies have shown that such synchrony can arise in randomly connected recurrent networks operating in asynchronous irregular ( Amit, 1989; Amit and Brunel, 1997; Brunel, 2000; Renart et al., 2010; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996; Vicente et al., 2008 ) and synchronous irregular regimes ( Brunel, 2000; Brunel and Hakim, 1999; Brunel and Wang, 2003; Ledoux and Brunel, 2011 ). In both regimes, individual neurons fire spikes highly irregularly at low rates, a typical situation in a cortex. The major distinction is that in an asynchronous regime population spike rate is steady in time, whereas in a synchronous regime it becomes oscillatory. We show that simulated prefrontal networks operating near the boundary between steady ( asynchronous irregular ) and oscillatory ( synchronous irregular ) regimes in the synaptic parameter space can explain several key experimental observations. First, such networks achieve biologically realistic stochastic spike trains and firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in prefrontal cortex. Second, increased extrinsic inputs, such as those that might occur during behavior, shift these networks from a steady to an oscillatory regime that causes the emergence of 0-lag spiking between neurons as they stochastically entrain to oscillatory population activity. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony. Although prior modeling studies have addressed the relationship between NMDAR function and oscillatory activity in prefrontal networks ( Brunel and Wang, 2003; Compte et al., 2000; Kirli et al., 2014; Wang, 1999 ), none account for this range of experimental observations. The current results allow us to establish strong parallels between simulated and biological data, including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking via recurrent synaptic interactions between neurons during behavior, the association between synchronous spiking and oscillatory population activity, as well as their joint dependence on NMDAR synaptic mechanisms, both in our current simulation and in the neural data ( Zick et al., 2018 ). 
 In this section, we summarize main experimental findings reported previously by our group ( Zick et al., 2018 ). In that study, spike trains of ensembles of single neurons were recorded simultaneously from PFC of monkeys while they performed the dot-pattern expectancy ( DPX ) task, a task that measures specific deficits in cognitive control in schizophrenia ( Jones et al., 2010 ). In the DPX task, the correct response ( left or right joystick movement ) to a probe stimulus depends on a preceding cue followed by a delay period ( Materials and methods ). In the present study, we focus on PFC population spike dynamics recorded in the DPX task under two conditions: drug-naive and drug. The drug naive data were collected before monkeys were administered drug, phencyclidine, which is an NMDA receptor antagonist. Figure 1 shows the population average pairwise correlation between spike trains of neurons recorded in drug-naive ( black ) and drug ( magenta ) conditions. The strength of spike correlation was quantified by the ratio between the observed frequency of synchronous spikes ( 1ms resolution ) and the frequency expected if the spike trains were uncorrelated ( we subtracted 1 from this ratio so that correlation value is zero for uncorrelated, positive for correlated, and negative for anticorrelated spike activity, Materials and methods ). The frequency of spike synchrony was determined from activity observed during a short ( 100 ms-long ) window that was slid across time of task performance. Figure 1A shows that spike synchrony obtained from trials aligned to the cue onset ( time 0 ) remained relatively weak and unchanged during the cue and delay periods, until the probe onset, in both drug-naive and drug conditions. The corresponding population average spike rates during these periods are shown in Figure 1C. Because the instant of response after probe presentation varied from trial to trial, to appreciate the time course of synchrony and spike rate after the delay period immediately preceding the response, in Figure 1B and D we aligned trials to response time ( time 0 ). It is seen that synchrony started to increase sharply about 200ms before the motor response in the drug-naive condition and reached its peak at the time of the response ( Figure 1B, black ). The spike rate also started to increase before the response but more gradually and starting earlier before the response ( Figure 1D, black ). Both spike synchrony ( Figure 1B ) and spike rate ( Figure 1D ) exhibited secondary peaks occurring approximately 150–250ms after the response. In the drug condition, however, the increase in spike synchrony at the time of the response was markedly weakened ( Figure 1B, magenta ). The increase in spike rate was also reduced, although less dramatically ( Figure 1D, magenta ). We term this effect as NMDAR blockage induced desynchronization of spiking activity. To understand the phenomenon of drug-induced desynchronization of spiking activity and the role played by various components of synaptic currents, we considered a spiking network model representing a local circuit of monkey PFC. Details of the model and the theoretical framework are given in Materials and methods. Here, we only highlight their main aspects. The network comprises excitatory and inhibitory neurons representing populations of pyramidal cells and interneurons embedded in a sparsely connected recurrent network with realistic NAR, GABA, and AMPA mediated synaptic currents. We used stability and mean field analyses to investigate how the balance between NMD and AMP components of recurrent excitatory and inhibitory currents influence network dynamics and spike synchrony. We found that networks operating near the boundary between steady (asynchronous ) and oscillatory (synchronous ) regimes in the parameter space can explain several experimental observations. First, such networks produce biologically realistic spike trains and rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in PFC. Second, extrinsic inputs, such as those that might occur during behavior, shift networks from steady to oscillatory causing emergence of 0-l spiking between neurons as they stochastically entrain to oscillatory activity. Third, and most importantly, we show that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents networks from transitioning into oscillatory in response to extrinsic inputs thereby preventing emergence of 0-l spikey synchrony. Our results provide a plausible mechanism for the link between NMD synaptic and 0-l spike synchrony deficits observed in pharmacological monkey model of prefront network failure in schizophrenia. 
The article discusses the relationship between NMD synaptic function and 0-l spike synchrony in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a cognitive task.

    Title: 
    Article: Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, usually in hypoxic micro-environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication. The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood. Here, by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses, we find that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. Together, our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes. 
 Angiogenesis, that is, the formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing ones, is a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in an adult differentiated endothelium. Pro-angiogenic factors secreted in response to hypoxic conditions, particularly the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ), specify differentiation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels into diverse phenotypic states, including the pro-migratory Tip cell phenotype. Tip cells can initiate invasive cell migration into the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ), leading to sprouting and branching of the nascent vessels ( Adams and Alitalo, 2007; Potente et al., 2011 ). Tip cells are differentiated from Stalk cells, another phenotypic state, through juxtacrine cell–cell interaction between these cell types involving NOTCH1 signaling, triggered and modulated by induction of Dll4 and Jag1 ligands ( Benedito et al., 2009; Blanco and Gerhardt, 2013 ). Stalk cells can therefore form in immediate proximity of Tip cells, particularly, at the leading edge of an extending sprout, if the NOTCH signaling is sufficiently pronounced for the Tip–Stalk differentiation to occur. Proliferation of Stalk cells is as essential as the invasive migration of Tip cells for the emergence, extension and branching of growing sprouts, making the analysis of coordinated Tip and Stalk specification particularly important. The inputs specifying the cell fate can be potentially contradictory, for example, with pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, promoting the Tip cell fate, and the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells promoting the Stalk cell fate and thus suppressing the Tip cell identity in the same cell. These and other signaling inputs can thus be incoherent in terms of cell fate specification and can result in complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood. Further elucidation of these processes thus requires high-resolution, quantitative experimental measurements tightly coupled with computational analysis. Since such measurements are still challenging in vivo, particularly in mammalian tissues, use of tissue models recapitulating the salient features of the developing vasculature is a key tool in the current analysis of angiogenesis and development of de novo vascular beds. Previously, we and others have developed a set of micro-fabricated experimental angiogenesis models that have had progressively improved biomimetic characteristics ( Wang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Kang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2013 ). These characteristics include spatially and biochemically appropriate cell micro-environments, composed of components of the ECM and of gradients of growth factors and cytokines around the developing vasculature, which is composed of endothelial cells and pericytes. We have previously used this approach to map different combinations of VEGF and an inflammatory cytokine, Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ), onto pro- and anti-angiogenic outcomes, modeling frequently encountered angiogenesis conditions ( Kang et al., 2019 ). This analysis provided evidence that ‘mini-sprouts’ — one-cell structures protruding from the parental blood vessel into the surrounding matrix — were comprised of Tip cells. However, it was not clear whether all such ‘mini-sprouts’ would ultimately develop into more mature multicellular sprouts with defined lumens and the potential to form new blood vessels. Furthermore, although our analysis was successful in explaining the fraction of Tip cells formed under different conditions, it was not clear how to account for the spatial aspects of the Tip cell and mature sprout specification, such as their mutual separation and density. We address these challenges here by extending our analysis to a higher temporal and spatial resolution, both in experimental and mathematical models of angiogenic sprouting. Surprisingly, we found that the formation of mini-sprouts was a highly dynamic process, in which they could either retract after extension or form full-fledged sprouts. Furthermore, the experimentally determined spatial positioning of mini-sprouts was well explained by the predicted locations of the Tip cells in the mathematical model but the model could not account for which of the mini-sprouts would become fully formed sprouts. Further analysis revealed that the stable sprout formation from mini-sprouts can be enabled by the local fluctuations of the density of fibronectin, a key pro-angiogenic ECM component, leading to sparse patterns where sprouts tend to maximally distance themselves from other fully formed sprouts. These results reveal some of the key mechanisms that may define the density of the angiogenically formed vascular beds under diverse conditions. 
 To investigate the properties of angiogenic patterning and cell fate specification, we used an experimental model previously employed to assess the crosStalk between pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory stimuli ( Kang et al., 2019 ). In this experimental setup, angiogenesis occurs from a 3D parental engineered endothelial vessel embedded in the collagen matrix and exposed to exogenously supplied VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors ( Figure 1A, B ). In agreement with prior observations, we found that this setup resulted in formation of both one-cell extensions into the matrix ( mini-sprouts ) and full-fledged multicellular sprouts containing detectable lumens and pronounced leading Tip cells ( Figure 1C ). Sprouts displayed a variety of growth stages, including the very early ones, composed of one lumenized cell or pairs of connected cells, also forming a lumen ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Although mini-sprouts formed throughout the observation area of the vessel, sprouts developed within specific zones, while other zones remained devoid of detectable sprout formation over the course of the study ( Figure 1D–F ). These observations suggested that cell fate specification and sprout formation are dynamic processes that may display diverse local outcomes. We therefore set out to characterize these processes in the context of an accessible and well-defined analysis tool that can allow to contrast experimental findings with mathematical models of angiogenic patterning, particularly those based on the commonly assumed NOTCH receptor-mediated cell–cell interactions ( Figure 1G ). To set the framework for the analysis of cell fate determination, we extended our previously developed and experimentally validated mathematical model of Tip–Stalk fate differentiation between two cells ( Boareto et al., 2015b ) to a multicellular hexagonal lattice in two dimensions. In the new model, we replicated within each cell the signaling network incorporating the NOTCH and VEGF pathways ( Figure 2A ). Prior analysis of this model on the level of two adjacent cells predicted the emergence of bistability between a ( high NOTCH, low Delta ) Stalk phenotype and a ( low NOTCH, high Delta ) Tip phenotype ( Boareto et al., 2015b ). This result is consistent with the overall expectation of the differentiation effect of Delta–NOTCH signaling, which in 2D is further expected to generate ‘salt-and-pepper’ patterns, with a single Tip cell surrounded by six Stalk cells ( Bocci et al., 2020 ), yielding the overall fraction of Tip cells in this arrangement of 25%. However, this simple bistability and spatial patterning picture can be altered by signaling inputs that potentially conflict with those involved in Delta–NOTCH signaling ( Figure 1G ). For example, the VEGF pro-angiogenic factor promoting the Tip cell fate, can conflict with the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells that instead promotes the Stalk cell fate while suppressing the Tip cell identity. This might result in disordered patterns with adjacent Tip cells that deviate from the archetypical salt-and-pepper configuration. To explore the properties of this disordering effect, we ran simulations, in which the VEGF–NOTCH signaling occurred in all individual cells within a hexagonal array of the model multicellular endothelium, starting from randomized initial conditions ( Figure 2A ). The fully equilibrated patterns were then analyzed for distributions of the simulated Delta and NOTCH expression across the cells. We found for a wide range of VEGF inputs that the distributions of Delta and NOTCH displayed largely bimodal distributions, and the levels of the average Delta expression increased with the increasing input ( Figure 2B, C ). This is consistent with the expectation that VEG promotes the Tip cell and NOT the St cell. However, for higher VEG inputs, the distributions of Delta and NOT became unimodal and the average levels of Delta decreased ( Figure 2D, E ). This is consistent with the expectation that VEG suppresses the St cell and promotes the Tip at high levels of VEG. These results suggest that VEG–NOT signaling can induce an order–disorder transition in the spatial patterning of Tip and St cells in the multicellular endothelium. To further investigate the dynamics of this transition, we ran simulations in which the VEG–NOT signaling occurred only in a subset of the cells within the hexagonal array ( Figure 2F ). We found that the order–disorder transition occurred only in the subset of cells where VEG–NOT signaling was sufficiently high ( Figure 2G, H ). This is consistent with the expectation that VEG promotes the Tip and NOT suppresses the St in the cell. We also found that the order–disorder transition was robust but temporally unstable, in that is, it was not sustained over time ( Figure 2I ). This is consistent with the expectation that VEG–NOT signaling is dynamic and can change over time. To understand the dynamics of the order–dis transition, we ran simulations in which the VEG–NOT signaling occurred in a subset of cells with varying levels of VEG ( Figure 2J ). We found that the order–dis transition occurred only in subset of cells with high VEG ( Figure 2, K ). This is consistent with expectation that VEG promotes Tip and suppresses St at high levels. We also found that the order–dis transition was robust but temporally unstable, that is, not sustained over time ( Figure 2 ). This is consistent with expectation that VEG–NOT is dynamic and can change over time. To further investigate the dynamics of the order–dis transition, we ran simulations in which VEG–NOT occurred in a subset of cells with varying levels of NOT ( Figure 2 ) We found that the order–dis occurred in subset cells with high NOT ( Figure 2 ) This is consistent with expectation that NOT suppresses St and promotes Tip at high. We also found the order–dis was temporally unstable that is not over time ( Figure 2 ) This consistent expectation that NOT is dynamic can change. To understand the dynamics of the order– transition we ran simulations in which V– occurred a subset cells varying levels ( Figure 2 We found order– in cells high ( Figure This consistent that promotes Tip and suppresses at high. also temporally unstable is not over ( Figure consistent that dynamic can change To investigate the dynamics of the order– transition we ran in which VEG– a subset cells varying ( Figure We found order in high ( consistent that promotes and suppress at tempor unstable is not over consistent dynamic can To understand the dynamics of the order transition we ran in VEG a subset varying ( We found order in high that promotes and suppress tempor unstable not consistent dynamic To investigate the dynamics of the order we ran in V a subset varying ( found order in high that promotes and tempor not unstable consistent To understand the dynamics of the order we ran V varying ( found in high promotes and tempor not consistent To investigate the dynamics of the order we ran a subset ( found in high promotes and not consistent To understand the dynamics of the order we ran ( found in high and not To understand the dynamics of the order we ran ( found in not To understand the dynamics of the we ran ( found not To understand the dynamics we ran ( found not To the dynamics we ran ( found not

    Title: 
    Article: Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not. 
 The locus coeruleus ( LC ) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment. LC neurons accomplish this via two distinct modes of activity: tonic and phasic. Changes in the frequency of tonic activity are associated with corresponding changes in psychological state. Low tonic activity ( ~0–2 Hz ) is associated with drowsiness or sleep and increasing levels of tonic activity ( ~3–10 Hz ) are associated with increased arousal, progressing from exploration and task engagement to agitation and anxiety states ( Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005 ). Bouts of phasic activity ( ~10–20 Hz ) are most often observed during intermediate levels of tonic activity in response to salient environmental events ( Aston-Jones et al., 1999 ). When locked to task-relevant events, these phasic responses are associated with improved cognitive performance across a variety of tasks ( Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005 for review ). A large body of research supports the idea that the LC is critically involved in memory formation. Monoamine depletion in the LC, noradrenergic and dopaminergic antagonism in multiple brain regions, and direct inhibition of the LC all impair memory across a number of tasks ( Giustino and Maren, 2018; Lisman and Grace, 2005; Selden et al., 1990; Uematsu et al., 2017; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). Conversely, LC stimulation as well as dopamine and norepinephrine agonism can enhance memory ( Bach et al., 1999; Kempadoo et al., 2016; Packard and White, 1991; Packard and White, 1989; Sara and Devauges, 1988 ). Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus ( HPC ) and other cortical regions ( Devoto and Flore, 2006; Smith and Greene, 2012 ). In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the HPC may be more important for memory than norepinephrine ( Kempadoo et al., 2016; Takeuchi et al., 2016; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). However, studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling. In some cases, this distinction is prevented by the use of temporally imprecise manipulations like lesions and drug infusions. In others, it is difficult to determine the importance of time-locked phasic firing because of the use of spatial memory tasks that are commonly used to assess hippocampus ( HPC ) -dependent memory. Because space is a temporally diffuse stimulus, it is difficult to know the exact moments during spatial learning when phasic responses might be important. This does not rule out the possibility that phasic LC activity and dopamine signaling is important for spatial learning, but the lack of experimental control over the animals’ sampling of the relevant stimuli makes this possibility opaque to examination. Studies that have used discrete reward learning tasks to examine dopamine function in the HPC have also not typically distinguished between tonic and phasic release. To address these issues, we used a trace fear conditioning task in which animals learn an association between a neutral and aversive stimulus that are separated in time. Because trace fear conditioning ( a ) requires intact hippocampal activity ( Chowdhury et al., 2005; Raybuck and Lattal, 2014; Wilmot et al., 2019 ) and ( b ) involves learning about discrete, well-controlled stimuli, it is ideally suited to characterize the rapid temporal dynamics of LC activity and LC-HPC communication during learning and examine their role in long term memory formation. Here, we used fiber photometry and optogenetics to make temporally precise observations and manipulations of LC activity during learning in a trace fear conditioning task. We extend this data by providing direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the HPC and by showing that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not. 
 Before examining LC activity during learning, we sought to determine whether the LC exhibits phasic responses to the basic types of stimuli used in trace fear conditioning. Because previous research indicates LC activity may be modulated by the salience, or intensity, of environmental stimuli ( Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981; Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Vazey et al., 2018 ), we began by examining the responses of the locus coeruleus to neutral auditory stimuli of varying intensities ( 55 dB-95dB ). To observe LC responses to auditory stimuli, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s specifically in the LC of TH-Cre transgenic mice and implanted an optical fiber above the injection site to allow fiber photometric recordings of bulk LC activity ( Figure 1A and Figure 1B ). After recovery from surgery, GCaMP fluorescence in LC was measured as the mice were exposed to five interleaved presentations of a 3000 Hz pure tone at each dB level ( 25 total presentations ). Small phasic responses were seen at each dB level, but responses increased with tone intensity, with responses to the 95 dB tone most pronounced ( Figure 1C and D ), confirming that the magnitude of the LC response to an auditory stimulus is modulated by its intensity. We next examined LC responses to aversive stimuli. To determine whether LC responses are modulated by the intensity of an aversive stimulus, we recorded calcium activity in the LC while mice received foot shocks of varying intensity ( 0–0. 8mA ). Consistent with the idea that LC activity is modulated by the salience of environmental stimuli, we found that LC responses to foot shock were much larger than the previously observed responses to neutral auditory stimuli ( Figure 1C–F ). Additionally, consistent with previous reports, the size of the LC response to footshock increased with foot shock intensity ( Figure 1E and F; Chen and Sara, 2007; Hirata and Aston-Jones, 1994; Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986; Uematsu et al., 2017 ). The results of these initial experiments demonstrate that the LC responds to both neutral and aversive stimuli and that LC response magnitude is positively correlated with the salience and/or valence of the stimulus. Having demonstrated that the locus coeruleus is responsive to salient environmental events, we next sought to determine whether its responses are modulated by learning. Again, we began by using fiber photometry to monitor LC responses to a neutral auditory stimulus. If the LC responds to novelty or salience, we would expect the responses to diminish over repeated experiences with a stimulus as the animal habituates to its presence ( Thompson and Spencer, 1966 ). To test this idea, we recorded activity in the LC over the course of 3 days as animals were repeatedly exposed to the same tone ( 85 dB, 3 KHz; Figure 2A ). As expected, LC responses to the tone were largest on the first day and gradually reduced in magnitude over the next 2 days ( Figure 2B and C ). The LC also responded to tone termination, and while this response also appeared to habituate across days, the effect did not reach significance ( Main effect of day F ( 2, 8 ) = 3. 36, p=0. 087 ). This finding is consistent with prior work showing that animals process the termination of an auditory CS as a distinct, salient event that itself can undergo conditioning ( Sommer-Smith, 1967; Sommer-Smith et al., 1962 ). Next, we examined the effect of associative fear learning on LC responses in a second group of mice that underwent the same procedures, except that on the first day they received ten trace fear conditioning trials instead of unpaired tone presentations ( Figure 2D ). On the second and third days, responses to the tone were significantly larger than in mice that did not receive fear conditioning ( Figure 2E and F ), indicating that LC activity is modulated by the association of the tone with an aversive stimulus. These results demonstrate that the LC responds to salient stimuli and that its responses are modulated by learning and habituation. Having established that the LC responds to salient stimuli and is modulated by learning, we next sought to determine whether optogenetic stimulation of the LC can enhance long-term memory formation. We used a trace fear conditioning task in which mice received optogenetic stimulation of the LC during learning ( Figure 3 ). Mice were implanted with an optical fiber above the LC and received optogenetic stimulation of the LC during trace conditioning ( Figure 3A ). Mice that did not receive optogen stimulation served as controls ( Figure 3 ). We found that mice that received optogen stimulation of the LC during trace conditioning had significantly better long-term memory than those that did not ( Figure 3 and ), indicating that optogenetic stimulation of the LC can enhance long-term memory. We also found that mice that received optogen stimulation of LC during trace conditioning had larger responses to the tone than those that did not receive optogen ( Figure 3 and ), suggesting that optogen stimulation of the LC can also enhance responses to salient stimuli. These results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of the LC can enhance both long-term memory and responses to salient stimuli. Having established that optogen stimulation of LC can enhance long-term memory, we next sought to determine the role of dopamine and norephrine in this effect. We used mice that received optogen stimulation of LC during trace conditioning and measured dopamine and noreph content in the HPC ( Figure 4 ). We found that mice that received optogen stimulation of LC during trace had significantly more dopamine in the HPC than those that did not ( Figure 4 and ), indicating that optogen stimulation of LC increases dopamine in the HPC. We also found that mice that received optogen of LC during trace had significantly more nph in the H than those that did not ( Figure 4 ), indicating that optogen of LC also increases nph in the H. However, we found that mice that received optogen of LC during trace had better long-term memory than those that did not ( Figure 4 ), indicating that dopamine is more important for long-term memory than nph. These results demonstrate that optogen of LC increases both dopamine and nph in the H and that dopamine is more important for long-term memory than nph. Finally, we sought to determine the timing of dopamine release in the H during trace conditioning. We used mice that received optogen of LC during trace and measured dopamine release in the H ( Figure 5 ). We found that dopamine release in the H during trace was similar to the timing of LC activity ( Figure 5 and ), indicating that dopamine release in the H is time-locked to LC activity. These results demonstrate that dopamine in the H is time-locked to LC activity and that dopamine is more important for long-term memory than nph. In conclusion, we found that the LC responds to salient stimuli and its responses are modulated by learning and habituation. We also found that optogen stimulation of LC can enhance long-term memory and responses to salient and that dopamine is more important for long-term memory than nph. We also found that dopamine in the H is time-locked to LC activity and is more important for long-term than nph. These results provide new insights into the role of the LC in learning and memory and the importance of dopamine and nph in this process.
