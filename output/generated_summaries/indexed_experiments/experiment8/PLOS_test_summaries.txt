This study presents a stochastic model for the transmission of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and fits it to data from 16 health areas in the Mosango zone, Kwu province. The model captures the dynamics of AT observed at the health level of approximately 10,000 people and is the first stochastic model to be directly fitted to data. The authors use a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMC) methodology to fit the model to the data, allowing for calibration of a stochastic model rather than relying on a deterministic variant without stochastic event variation. The study assesses the quality of the model for health areas and compares the benefits of fitting the stochastic model to a deterministic model or outputs from a stochastic with parameterisation from deterministic. The results show that the stochastic model is more computationally intensive than the deterministic but provides similar outputs. The model captures the trend in reported cases and the expected number of new infections, with higher screening coverage resulting in higher case reporting and passive numbers more stable. The basic reproduction number R is a parameter of the model, which defines the number of new infections from a single in a population, and is close to but greater than one for AT. The distribution of R in the zone shows substantial variation between areas, justifying the use of a finer-scale model. The median R values from fitting all areas have 1 ≤ R ≤ 1.04, with posterior distributions deviating from the prior. The proportion of stage 2 cases reported in passive, u(199), is similar across the zone, with median in the range 0.29 ≤ u(199) ≤ 0.37 and posterior distributions overlapping. The study also fits the model to the zone data and deterministic variant using the methodology of Crump et al. and compares the three approaches, providing similar outputs that capture the dynamics in the data. The stochastic model indicates more uncertainty in the number of infections, with a range of outcomes matching the data, and more in later years where AT is closer to elimination. The posterior of the deterministic in the stochastic projections outputs similar to the full output, rather than the deterministic.
The article presents a novel approach for analyzing tumor microenvironment (TME) data using a combination of spatial statistics and functional analysis. The method aims to identify significant differences in ME between patient groups and predict patient outcomes using ME and meta-data. The approach is applicable to marked point processes in general and has benefits of generalizability, few parameters, and visualized output. The authors evaluate the method on simulated data, demonstrating its effectiveness for spatial patterns with interactions. The approach is then applied to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and lung cancer data from multiplex ion imaging. For TNBC, the model compares "compartmentalized" and "mixed" groups based on tumor-immune interactions, showing differences in ME. The model demonstrates predictive accuracy and identifies specific relationships and interactions. Lung data shows the model can detect differences in cell relationships. The approach assumes homogeneity of spatial processes defining ME functions, which may not always apply. However, comparing functions between groups rather than theoretical randomness mitigates this issue. The method can be applied to any summary statistics or functions. The approach can be adapted for raw protein expression and non-cellular contexts. The model assumes categorical outcomes, but can be extended to real-valued data, such as survival.
This study investigates the effects of synaptic and structural plasticity on network dynamics in a model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic structural plasticity (SP). The model combines STDP and SP to capture the interactions between neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and structural changes while maintaining distinct timescales of the three mechanisms. The authors introduce a stochastic SP that abstracts from details of spine and bouton genesis, allowing for faster implementation, and combine it with ST-driven dynamics. They study synchronized states of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks of identical and non-identical neurons with ST-only, finding that high connectivity does not necessarily favor synchronized activity. The authors generate networks from unconnected neurons using ST+SP and ST+h and compare their transition to synchronized states as a function of density, finding that ST+ and ST+h require smaller average degree to achieve synchrony. They study synchronization of heterogeneous networks with combination ST and SP, finding that neurons become more identical as they add or lose contacts, making for enhanced synchronization. The authors find a strong relationship between natural rate and in- and out-degrees, with faster neurons projecting onto others driving slower ones. They observe degree-frequency correlation, suggesting optimization of structure for synchrony, and assortativity in networks, which are more robust against node or targeted attack but vulnerable to external perturbation. The authors study transition of ST+ to desynchronized for values of weight pruning probability, finding average degree decreases with increase, and comparable values make desynchronized denser than synchronized. They conclude that structure is related to dynamical state, and networks can enter pathological or physiological states depending on initial conditions, and plasticity is crucial for physiological mechanisms. The model provides a testbed for development of methods causing long-lasting effects by reshaping connectivity and activity in presence of plasticity, and structure in synchronized is critical for robustness against perturbation.
Planarians, a type of freshwater flatworm, have the ability to regenerate their entire body parts, including their nervous system, through a process called whole-body regeneration. This process involves the proliferation of stem cells called neoblasts, which can differentiate into various cell types, including neurons and glia. However, the coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in the planarian nervous system is poorly understood. Researchers investigated the role of the Notch signaling pathway in the regeneration of glia in planarians. They found that Notch signaling is required for the regeneration of glia and maintenance of glial gene expression in mature glia. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of regenerating and uninjured planarians showed that the glial cluster was absent in notch-1 and delta-2 RNA animals. Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and suppressor of hairless (Su(H) caused a failure of neuropil gl regeneration following amputation. Glia were depleted in uninjured delta-2 RNA animals after short RNAi, but mildly reduced in notch-1 short RNA animals. Remaining glia in short uninjured notch-1 and delta-2 RNA animals clustered with control glial cells. Long-term RNA without injury, gl were depleted in both notch-1 and delta-2 heads. Glial cells were required for neuronal troph support, including uptake of neurotransmitters, synaptic pruning, axonal outgrowth, and pathfinding, and circuit formation. Animals were viable after 30 days of notch-1, Su(H), and delta-2 RNA, but showed darkening around cephal ganglia and ventral cords. Immunolabeling with anti-tubulin did not show changes in axonal projections across RNA treatments. Percentages of neuronal clusters and FISH for subsets were distributed similarly following long RNA. Planarians were able to find the darker side of the arena within 2-3 minutes, albeit slower than control, showing capacity for locomotion and negativeotaxis. Overstimulation by shaking and light showed delayed or unable to find the side notch-1, Su(H), and-2 RNA animals. Notch-1 was expressed in phocytic cells, gl subcluster, epider, and protophia. Delta-2 was in neurons, epider, and sparse in neuronal clusters. Transplantation of notch- deficient eyes into wild-type recipients showed association with gl, while delta- deficient eyes were depleted of gl. The presence of delta- in neurons was essential for notch-expressing gl progenitors to differentiate into glia. The study uncovered a mechanism for regenerative patterning of neurons for glia, where specific classes of neurons activate delta-2 and interact with notch-express phoc progenitors to form glia.
This study investigated the role of gamma delta (γ) T cells in the immune response to HIV-1 infection and their potential contribution to the development of neutralizing antibodies. Gamma T cells are a type of immune cell that play a crucial role in the response to various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. They express a limited repertoire of T cell receptors and are not restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I or II. In humans, the most common subset in peripheral blood is defined by expression of the V2 chain and recognize peptide produced by some bacteria and protozoa such as Plasmodium falciparum. Gamma cells are abundant in mucosal tissues and also found in peripheral, albeit at lower frequency, and antigens recognized by their TCR are less defined. One feature of gamma cells is their capacity to become antigen-presenting cells, including interaction with opsonized target by CD, the low-affinity FcRI, at the surface gamma cells. They can promote humoral responses directly by stimulating maturation of B cells or indirectly by stimulating differentiation of follicular helper T cells, thus bridging innate and adaptive responses. HIV-1 has a profound impact on gamma cells. Early reports showed V1 cells are expanded in people living with HIV, while V2 cells were decreased and poorly responsive to T stimulation. As a result of susceptibility to HIV infection, V2 cells contribute to viral reservoirs in people on antiretroviral therapy. Gamma cells have been reported to have anti-HIV activity by producing chemokines that block viral entry or direct cytotoxic against HIV-infected cells. This study investigated gamma cells prior HIV acquisition and during acute infection in individuals previously identified as broad and nonroad neutralizers and determined their relationship with viral replication and neutralization. Results showed V2 cells were reduced early and associated with viral load, while V1 cells expanded during chronic infection and associated with CD T activation. Expression of CD on V1 and CD57 on V2 cells was higher in broad neutralizers and associated with development of neutral breadth. Levels of CD on V1 cells were associated with early Env-specific IgM, suggesting CD V1 may promote B engagement during acute.
This study presents a computational model of a bispecific antibody (BS) targeting IL-6α and IL-8 receptors, which are involved in a synergistic pathway driving metastasis. The model consists of a series of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for receptors, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes, with association and dissociation processes represented as terms in the ODEs. The model is parameterized using in vitro data and matches experimental results and constrains parameters well. Simulations of antibody binding to cells with one or both receptors and combinations of monos antibodies reveal mechanistic differences between treatments. One arm of the antibody binds, the second receptor must be within reach for the second event. The distance between antigen domains of Ig antibodies is around 6-12 nm, but arms are joined by a flexible region allowing up to 17-18 nm. Bispecific antibodies engage two receptors at these densities due to fast diffusion and non-uniform distribution. Binding one arm increases local concentration, leading to stronger second binding. Previous models incorporated avidity in various ways, including effective concentration, flexibility, and steric constraints. This model estimates independent association and dissociation rates using data. The ratio of first and second rates is χ, defined by Harms et al, with a value of 1.6 × 10^4, consistent with their range. Assumptions reduce parameters: shared first step rates, second step rates, and dissociation rates. Simulations reveal binding dynamics, with binary-receptor formation quickly followed by ternary-antody-receptor. When one receptor is excess, binary accumulate after ternary reaches steady. After washout, ternary increases due to dissociation and receptor availability. The combined concentration and receptor level determine relative binary and ternary formation, creating "zones" of different types. Ternary are key pharmacologically relevant, elucidating mechanisms is important for bispecific targeting. When antibody is excess, lessable form favored; ternary dominant at intermediate concentrations and higher expression. Receptor occupancy increases with concentration and receptor level, counterintuitive due to ternary formation. Sensitivity analysis shows maximal tern depends on balance of concentration and association rates. Tern by lower affinity concentration-limited, higher affinity show auto-inhibition. The binding depends on affinity, cross-link, and concentration, with a "Goldilocks" effect. Affinity and avidity window drives in vivo selectivity. Intermediate-affinity utilize bivalent, high-affinity monoval. This model can be applied to specific targets to predict affinities and cross-link capacities. The level of receptor and relative targets are critical for bispecific, with distinct patterns at subatur concentrations. Monos bind strongly to excess, bis to limited. The model provides mechanistic insight and predictions for maximal therapeutic design.
This study investigates the role of ZYG-8, a conserved microtub-associated protein, in centrosomal spindle formation and stability in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. ZYG-8 is required for proper spindle assembly and stability, and its depletion leads to elongated spindles, midindle destabilization, and pole splitting. ZYG8's kinase activity is necessary for its function, as a kinase-dead mutation causes embryonic lethality and spindle defects. ZYG8 regulates microtule dynamics and motor forces, promoting proper spindle size and organization. FRAP experiments show that Z-8 depletion slows tubulin turnover, suggesting microtules become more stable, which could cause spindle elongation. Z8 also influences motor activity, possibly by phosphorylating BM-1 or other motors to regulate force balance. BM-1 provides outward forces upon Z8 depletion, and Z8 may dampen its activity. Z8 has both kinase-dependent and independent functions, with the doubleort domain modulating microtule dynamics or motor activity. The study provides new insights into doubleort-family function in cell division and how forces are balanced in centomal spindles.
This study investigated the relationship between plasma metabolites, genetics, and type 2 diabetes (T2) risk and complications in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightale panel of 249 metabolites, mostly lipids and lipoproteins (92%). Bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis found 79 metabolites causally associated with T2, spanning lipid classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2 liability, spanning all classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Interaction trait locus (QTL) analysis identified four metabolites consistently in an independent Estonian dataset, with genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls. Significant QTLs from interaction analysis were not associated with T risk in the general population but not with T2 complications. Differential analysis found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of 165 metabolites, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to complications. This work provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding of T2 trajectory to complications.
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways hosts can survive infection. Resistance limits pathogen burden, while tolerance limits health impact of pathogen burden. Previous work established that collaborative cross (CC) line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, USA300) while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, CC061 and CC mice were crossed to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA in F1 and F generations was 65% and 55, respectively, following a complex inheritance pattern for CC024 survival. Colonization in F2 was more extreme than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight after infection was identified. The WSB/EJ allele in CC024 contributed to MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, have high-impact variants in this region. Car1 and Car are receptors for complement Ca, anaphylato that trigger massive response by binding to receptors. Hypothesize Ca may have altered variant in CC mice, reducing cytokine storm and resulting in ability to tolerate higher pathogen and survive longer.
This study explores how a simple gene regulatory network influences trait evolution during an adaptive scenario. Traditional models of adaptation rely on genotype-phenotype relationships, overlooking intricate gene networks driving trait expression at different development stages. The study finds similarities between network and additive models in adaptive walks, number of steps, and distribution of fitness among fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the distribution of beneficial mutations is sensitive to estimation method. A pooled approach leads to homogenization of shape, nudging distribution towards Gumb domain, while non-pooled preserves unique contributions, improving detection of non-Gel behavior. The study discusses variation estimates of shape using pooled and nonooled approaches. Pooled GPs belonged to Weull domain, while nonooled showed Weull at all steps, rejecting Gillespie's Gumb expectation. Weull-distributed Ds have been observed in viral and bacterial populations, near optimum, and stabilizing selection. Both models starved large-effect mutations, more in network than additive. Network approached optimum more slowly, difference not solely due to N structure, but allelic scaling. The distribution of new mutations was complex, bimodal, more than additive, suggesting N contributes shape. The N model has a nonlinear relationship between β/α and phenotype, genotype-phenotype map, imposing constraints, multimodal deleter D. The study introduces epistasis, trade-offs complexity and adaptability, cost of complexity, and limitations on evolution. The N motif is simple, but complexity apparent in D. The cost of complexity might be more driving evolution than thought. Empirical examples exist, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizacomyces pombe, and reptile venom production. The study suggests strong limitations on evolution complex networks, Orr's model, rate declines according to inverse root number of traits. Aspects of structure, local and modularity, alleviate cost. The N motif imposes constraints on populations, density deleter alleles in D. Fixing N components renders behavior predictable, fitness solely ratio/α. The study assumes strong and weak mutation, computational efficiency and interpretability, sideline poly dynamics. The N motif offers insights, but lacks empirical complexity, future work with more architectures. The focus will shift to spectrum genetic architectures, capturing non-additive effects, including feed loops. This will enrich understanding topology evolutionary pathways, require statistical and computational innovations. Collaborations with biologists will enrich models mechanistic, rigorous against empirical and theories. The study contributes to field, broad applicability, maintenance variation, evolution, recombination, and adaptation. It shows networks generate epasis, implications, evolution recombination, linkage, and trade-offs.
The article proposes a novel Bayesian view on the dynamics of conduct-based neurons and synapses, suggesting that they are equipped to optimally perform information integration. The approach posits that apical dendrites represent expectations and basal dendrites likelihoods of somatic potentials, parametrized by local quantities such as effective potentials and conductances. The somatic compartment computes the posterior according to Bayes' theorem. A gradient-based plasticity rule is derived, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their relative reliabilities. The theory explains experimental findings on multisensory integration and single-cell level, and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian integration and plasticity. The model demonstrates learning in a multisensory task with modalities of different reliability. Cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have been described as driven by two classes of inputs, with top-down input on apical and bottom input basal. The framework suggests synaptic plasticity tries to match bottom input to top expectations, depending on the nature of top input. A neuron is considered a nonlinear element, with dendritic predicting somatic activity. Dendrites can be seen as performing dendritic opinion pooling, forming opinions on stimulus, weighting according to reliability, and predicting somatic imposed by teacher. The model makes predictions on certainty representation within a neuron, synaptic plasticity for learning, and cross-modal suppression. The biophysics of neurons can be interpreted as Bayesian computations, with dynamics of conduct-based models computing posterior from Gaussian functions and priors in dendrites. A probabilistic view of single computation yields same somatic membrane dynamics. The energy function is equivalent to log-posterior of somatic distribution, with som potential moving towards maximum-posterior estimate in absence of noise. Stochastic descent on KL divergence leads to learning rule for excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The plastic rule adapts mean and variance of somatic distribution, with second term depending on mismatch in variance and mean. The total conductance is inversely proportional to variance of target distribution. The interplay of conduct and potentials can be visualized in a plane spanned by inhibitory and excitatory conduct, with soma represented by sum of dendritic conduct vectors. The membrane of compartments is given by intersection of conduct vector with antidiagonal, a nonlinear operation instantiating convex computation connecting bioph to Bayesian.
Researchers used the AlphaFold database to predict protein structures for 48 proteomes, including 16 model organisms and 32 global health-related species, and classified them into domains using the Domain Parser for Alpha Models (DP) algorithm. They classified 490,060 proteins (~212 residues) and found that eukotes had a lower fraction of well-assigned domains (57.6 ± 5.5%) compared to bacteria (81.1 ± 6.9%). The most populated homolog groups in eukotes were ARM repeats, β-β fingers, I domains, and H domains, while in bacteria were H, Rosann, P, and TIM domains. The most populated homolog groups in both euk and bacteria were Rosann, P, TIM, and I domains. The researchers compared the population of homolog groups in the predicted structures to the experimental set and found significant differences, with euk H, I, ARM, and M domains underrepresented and H, Rosann, P, and TIM domains overrepresented. They also found that the MFS domains were well-stud but difficult to structurally characterize, with 93.4% and 98.7% covered by existing sequence classifications in InterPro. The unassigned domains had an average length of 99.8 ± 64.8 residues, with 46% all-α, 36% mixed, 11% αβ, and 3% all-β. The researchers used InterPro to compare the coverage of unassigned domains and found 15% had overlapping annotation, 85% not previously annotated. They examined sequence-annotated unassigned for evidence of novel topology and found many distantly homous to existing homolog groups in EC. They presented the classification of one case into the yeast-killer-like group as an example of converting putative domains into EC representatives.
Polyomavirus (BKV) is a major cause of kidney failure in transplant patients and is associated with increased risk of bladder cancer. Despite its prevalence and severity, there are no specific treatments for BKV reactivation. BKV relies on host replication machinery to replicate its DNA but provides its own helicase, large antigen (TAg). BKV replication activates the DNA damage response (DDR) which prolongs S phase and is necessary for viral replication. Following replication, BKV expresses structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 which encapsulate newly synthesized genomes to produce infectious virions. Unlike other DNA viruses, BKV uses DDR activation to induce and maintain replication. Human replication is temporally separated into two steps: origin and firing. Origin in G1, hexameric helicase components MCM-7 are recruited to origin complexes (OR) bound to DNA. M licensing is regulated by transcription and degradation to prevent re-lic of newly synthesized DNA in S. M activation or firing requires kinases C7 and C2 to recruit C45 and G complex to form functional helic. BKV induces replication without increased DNA damage or inhibiting C7 and C2. To understand BKV replication, single-cell techniques were used to characterize the cell cycle during BKV infection of human renal epithelial RP cells. Analysis revealed robust TAg expression in replicating cells, suggesting T expression depends on initial S. Inhibition of origin or firing prior replication decreased viral titers and T expression. Dual-pulse labeling showed rapid accumulation of T as cells entered G, followed by VP2/3 expression. Since BKV requires replication, it was investigated if BKV caused aberrant licensing, but pathways behaved canonically. Both origin kinases C7 and C2 were required for replication. A revised BKV life cycle model shows BKV requires initial S for robust T expression and replication during replication.
This study presents FIO, a novel transcript-wide association study (TWAS) fine-mapping method tailored for binary outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, FIO incorporates a probit model to capture the binary nature of disease and jointly models all genes on the same chromosome to account for genetically regulated expression (GRe) correlation across different blocks. Results show that FIO produces calibrated statistics and achieves high power. Simulations and real-world applications to six traits in the Biobank demonstrate the benefits of FIO. FIO employs a probit link to model the relationship between GRe and binary traits. The prob link introduces a latent variable, the liability, which determines disease status. FIO accounts for gene correlation outside local blocks by modeling all genes on the chromosome. The GRe displays correlation not only within blocks but also between blocks, with decreasing magnitude increasing distance. FIO requires individual GW data and uses a two-stage strategy for TW fine-mapping: eQ mapping to construct gene prediction and GW to infer weights. The study compares FIO with existing methods FOCUS, FOG, GIFT, and cTW. FOCUS and cTW use two-stage regression, while FOG and G use one-stage. Results show FIO outperforms other methods in power and efficiency. FIO is implemented in R and available at https://github.com/supgb/FIO.
Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfold proteins evade quality control, they form aggregates implicated in protein misfolding diseases. The sequestration of misfold proteins into intracellular sites is a regulated process that depends on dedicated chaperones termed sestrases. Sequestration of misfold proteins helps to cope with accumulation by partitioning them away from normal pathways, protecting against cytotoxic effects and facilitating degradation. Aggregation is a well-stud phenomenon, and key players are known, but the exact how growth and stress cause aggregation and the degree of stress in chaper response is unknown. The sequestration of misfold proteins is a conserved quality (PQC) strategy, but subcell localization differs between organisms. Yeast is the best characterized system relating stress-induced aggregation. Proteotoxic causes formation of spatial protein deposits including IPO (insoluble deposit), CyQ (ytoplasmic quality control), and IN (nuclear quality). Following misfolding, multiple CyQ are formed in cytoplasm, resolved to other sites including IN and IPO. Cytolic IPO, CyQ, and IN are thought to protect against overloading proteasis during mis conditions. Proteins targeted to CyQ and IN can refold, whereas terminally misfold and amyloid aggregates are targeted IPO. Hsp42 and Btn2 are key sestr required for deposition of misfold proteins into CyQ and IN, respectively. Hsp is a member of the heat shock family (HSP) of chaper and contains a prion domain (LD) essential for its function. Btn is a heat-like protein essential for IN formation. Btn has been shown to sequester misfold proteins to CyQ during heat conditions, whereas Btn is required for IN formation. The exact intracellular functions of Hsp and Btn have remained elusive, especially no growth defects observed in mutants. We investigated the roles of Hsp and Btn in proteasis during oxidative conditions. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide is known to inhibit translation and increase aggregation. We show that H and Btn are required for tolerance to oxidative stress, acting to sequest oxidatively damaged proteins. The absence of H and Btn leads to sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a functional requirement for seque in oxidant. We examined the localization of H and Btn during oxidative conditions and found increased co-localization with H104, a disagase. Overexpression of H104 rescues the sensitivity of mutants, suggesting H becomes limiting in the absence of H and Btn. We identified Sup35 as an in vivo substrate of H and Btn, showing increased aggregation and prion formation in mutants. The frequency of prion formation is unaffected in mutants during normal growth, but increased in response to oxidative. The localization of IPO is not required for prion formation in mutants, suggesting prion occurs at multiple sites.
A CRISPR-based invasion screen of 2,307 loci identified 45 hits that affect glioblastoma (GB) invasion. LINC45, a previously unannotated and poorly studied long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), was significantly associated with invasion. Functional methods such as CRISPR and CRISi screens have gained popularity due to their ability to quickly and efficiently identify therapeutic targets. Prior studies have focused on coding genes affecting glioma, but the role of ncRNAs in GB pathogenesis has only begun to grow, primarily focusing on ncRNAs in GB proliferation and progression. This study addresses the role of ncRN in GB invasion, suggesting noncoding RNAs play a functional role in this phenotype. Knockdown of candidate ncRNA via multiple methods, including CRPR and antisense oligonucleotides (AS), revealed decreases in tumor invasion while not affecting proliferation. Patient expression of LINC45 was higher in GB (grade 4) than LGG (grades 2-3) and LGG compared to normal tissue. Kaplan-Meier curves for gliomas (L and GB) showed patients with LINC45 were associated with decreased survival. After adjusting for grade and ID-status, higher L45 was associated with survival in LGG that included grades 2 and 3. The analysis for LGG included grades 2 and 3 because TCG defines LGG as these grades and a portion of L dataset did not distinguish between them. Notably, grade 2 and 3 gliomas within cohort did not differ in L45 expression. L45 did not appear to be associated with survival in GB (stage 4) with adjustment for ID-status. In GB, the majority of samples express L45 > 1.46, which is greater than the 75th percentile of L45 in other grades. It may be that above a significant effect threshold or the limited survival of grade 4, the expression in grade 4 is less significant to survival. The expression of L45 in GB in comparison to normal cortex and LGG suggests it has association with GB aggressiveness and grade. Prior has shown nc expression associated GB outcome and explored other nc as biomarker prognosis. The study of findings may reveal role L45 in patient as prognostic biomarker. The intersection between differential expression L45 in vitro and L45 changes vivo (in TCG) noted overlap of 16 out of 36 differentially expressed in vitro, with alterations in pathways cell and neural cell migration. Overlapping genes, including WAS3, EDB, SO10, BAM, have been implicated in processes including progression, migration, and invasion. WAS3, Wisk-Ald syndrome family member, has been regulator actin cytoskeleton in cancer and invasion, consistent with results. Studies shown scaffolding essential metastatic signaling, promoting metastasis activation leading edge structures. WAS3 associated invasion several cancers, breast, ovarian, inversely correlated overall-free survival.

A new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain is proposed to identify the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. The procedure has two stages: individual, where sets of segments of the signal per participant are grouped using a distance inspired by the projective method, and a consensus procedure to summarize the individual results. The sequence used in the experiment can be characterized by the occurrence of a strong unit, which is sufficient for the brain to predict the next stimulus. Results show that regions of the prefrontal cortex use the occurrence of the strong to identify the structure in the sequence, with a more role of the right hemisphere. The clustering approach unveils hidden features that could not be retrieved by a context model. Nineteen participants were instructed to listen to a sequence of auditory presented through headphones, with strong, weak, and silent stimuli. EEG were recorded during the presentation of the sequences. The elements of the set {0, 1, 2} represent silences, weak, beats, and strong, respectively. The sequence was generated by an algorithm using the set of participants, starting with X0 = 2, and for each n, let T be the largest such t and Xt = 2. The process generates sequences with an "amba-like" structure. A sample is 2 1 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 0. The label 2 represents the strong stimulus, a recurrent point that for any n and k with 2 ≤ n ≤ n + k ≤ N, P(Xn+k = xn+k|Xn-1=2, X0n-2 = x0-2) = P(Xn+k xn+k|n-1=2). A Geodes amplifier was used with high impedance 200Ω, and analog first order Butterworth band filter 0.3-50 Hz was applied to the signal. The Cz was used as reference during acquisition. Signal was acquired with frequency 500 Hz. Offline, data was referenced to average using EEGL package and fourth order Butter band filter 1-30 was applied. Analysis used electrodes E = {9, 10, 11, 18, 22, 74,75,82} in Geic numbering 128 sets. Each e, v, and n, we denote Yev the segment from signal starting 0.05 before onset and ending 0.4 after.

This study presents a computational method to calculate cell-specific weighting factors (cWF) to account for transcript size variations and cryptic gene expression in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of solid organs. The method computes WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs and demonstrates their role in accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using composite scRNA data weighted by WF. WF recapitulates experimentally determined mRNA content differences using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) data. WF differentially changes among cell types across organs over aging and predicts aging progression in a mouse model, suggesting a role in aging mechanism and possible diagnostic applications as biomarkers. The method is effective for heterogeneous organs but not homogenous organs like liver. It requires bulk and single RNA-seq data of target organs and tissues for WF inference, which may become less limiting as data availability grows. WF can be used for same cell types and organs from independently generated datasets. The method needs a prior knowledge of cell compositions of organs and tissues, which may become less limiting with growing scRNA data. One example shows pathological changes in heart cell ratio predicted using WF from healthy heart, despite introduced bias.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants used as instruments, violating one of the IV assumptions. Radial MR has been proposed to help identify pleotropic variants, but MVM plots are unavailable due to its multidimensional nature. A radial formulation of MVM and an adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. Radial M includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs that may violate M assumptions. The RMR package is presented for implementing the methods. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of radial and highlight how outliers can be visualized and removed. Radial M is applied to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease (CHD). Univar MR estimates are biased by pleiotropic effects through other fractions, while radial M shows a decrease in heterogeneity. Removing outlying SNPs reduces bias and increases precision. The radial approach is sensitive to pleropy, with balanced pleotropic effects not biasing estimates, but unbalanced pleotropic increasing bias.
Researchers recorded high-resolution, fine-grained behavior of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanaster) over multiple days with high temporal bandwidth using recent advances in GPU-based video processing and postural inference. They captured the behavior of freely moving D. melanaster over the course of days, encompassing the effects of daily rhythms, starvation, aging, and habituation at high resolution. The data recapitulated previously described trends in D. melan diurnal and aging patterns of behavior, while finding novel features of daily and lifelong trends. The method of behavior presented improved previous efforts to quantify D. melan behaviors over timescales. Previous studies separated small and peripheral motions from locomotion and quies using machine and supervised classifiers, while others focused on additional metrics to characterize locom activity across days. The combination of postural and unsup classification specified behaviors at higher granularity, such as different grooming modalities and locom states, allowing changes in specific modalities with time and flies' loss of ability to walk with age and stress. High-resolution postural data and fine-grained ethograms characterized changes probis extension duration across day, finding increased bout during hours. Locomotion speed, in addition to fraction spent locom, had daily pattern matching circadian studies. Compositional analysis identified hour lights as unique point in daily behavior, with increased grooming modalities, ethologically distinct from evening, possibly due to neuroomic mechanisms. The difference between day and night behaviors decreased across days, hour retained pattern until Day 4, when other indicators, locom speed, and non-idle began to decline.
This study identifies C. elegans tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor PTP-22 as an effector of molting, alleviating defects in nekl mutants with partial-to-moder loss function. PTP-22 is predicted to target phosphotyines, opposing NEKL functions indirectly, which have overlapping but distinct roles in membrane trafficking and actin filamentation. Proximity labeling, molecular, and subcell localization studies suggest P-22 is an accessory or regulator of the CDC-42 complex, which promotes actin polymerization. P-22 also interacts with act-capping proteins CAP-1, CAP-2, and GSN-1, blocking filament elongation. Genetic studies reveal a robust interaction between cap-2 and p-22, leading to embryonic lethality and early larval arrest. Proximity and genetic studies implicate P- in positively regulating Ce hemidesomes, components IF-1, PAT-12, V-10, and LET-805. RNA enhancement shows p- mutants are hypersensitive to knockdown Ce proteins, suggesting a role in Ce function. P- also interacts with PAT-2, a component of the integrin-attachment, and DL-1, epithelial junction. Proximity and expression implicate P in gerine functions through connection to granules, which are RNP membraneless organelles in the perin region of gerine nuclei. Nearly one-third of proteins identified by P- are gran components. The study highlights the value of combining forward genetics and proximity to gain insights into gene functions, expanding known P22 functions beyond the immune system, including molecular, cellular, and developmental.
Researchers used a comprehensive dataset from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network to study the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K) gene associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia. A Bayesian geostatistical model was used to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artem resistance. Maps showed expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 200 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The model provided insights into spatial and temporal trends of artem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling spatial support on fine-scale resolution. Predicting spatio patterns and extents oftem resistance at the subcontinent level supported malaria elimination goals in Southeast. Antimal drugs are essential for control and elimination, but resistance to all available antarials, including artem derivatives, have been confirmed. Studies in 200-2007 reported P. falcum in north Cambodia reduced susceptibility to artemins, with delayed clearance from blood patients treated with ACT. Delayed clearance is clinical hallmark of resistance. P. falc infections with slowed clearance undertem therapies detected in neighboring countries, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. Spatial changes in antimal resistance critical for health to prioritise control, but data ontem sparse. No fine-scale predictive maps exist fortem within Asia. Genetic markers associated with resistance used to monitor trends as proxy clinical efficacy, easier and less expensive than clinical studies. A previous study developed predictive model for dhps markers in Africa, extended with more recent data to 202. This model built Bayesian framework, informed by observed and prior knowledge. Maps proved useful, predictive combined with clinical data lowweight, showing SP should be compromised if dh-A marker > 30%. In 201, mutations in K propeller region associated with slow clearance identified, and 200 candidate genotypes established. Since, many studies conducted, historical samples reanalysed, significant data on prevalence. This paper presented predictive spatio-temp maps of changing artem landscape across Greaterong Sub. A geostat model of molecular associated markers in K, calibrated to comprehensive WWARN dataset. Spatio-temp maps K marker presented support monitoring drug in Asia, targeting strategies. Data from WW's artem survey, collated prevalence molecular in prop region K gene. Non-syn mutations at K locus > 440 captured, date, geos information.

NLRP and CARD proteins are components of the inflamome, a high-molecular multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in detecting pathogenic and endogenous signals, mediating the activation of inflammatory caspases. They contain a unique-to-domain (FI) that undergoes autopolysis, yielding full-length (FL), cleaved-terminal (NT), and cleaved-terminal (CT) peptides. These proteins form autoinhibitory complexes, including NT-CT and FL-CT interactions, with distinct mechanisms. The FI domain of FL proteins forms a conserved ternary complex with cleaved CT and cellular protease D9, while NT uses different domains to interact with CT. NLR1 employs Linker region between PY and NHT domains to bind N1CT, whereas mLR1 utilizes Linker between LRR and FI to interact with m1CT. r1 and CARD exploit Z5 subdomain for CT interactions. UPA in CT mediates interactions with Link1 (N1), Link3 (m1), or Z5 (1 and 8). Deletion of Link1 from1 or Link3 abolishes NTCT and results in spontaneous inflamome activation. N1 homologs exhibit sequence identity in N-terminus between humans and rodents, but form NTCT autohibitory complexes. m1 demonstrates polymorphism in mice, with five allelic variants, only allele possesses N1-N1 complex due to 61-amino-acid insertion in Link3. This may explain why m1 from C57/6 mice (allele) exhibits higher inflome activity than m from Bal/C (allele). D9 has been identified as a checkpoint for N1 and CARD inflomes through FL-D9- complex, dependent autopolysis within FI domain. D9 binds only full1 but not NT or CT, mutations cleavage sites eliminate interactions. m1, r, and CARD present different profile, both FL and NT bind D9 with affinity, mutations at cleavage do not impact interaction. Z5 sub of m, r, and CARD binds D9, suggesting D9 involved FL- and NT-CT. D9 restricts CT activity to prevent inflome in FL-D9 complex, does not affect CT or NT inhibitory NT-D complex. N and CARD inflomes can be activated by pathogenic proteases through degradation, cleaving NT, degrading NT, and liberating CT for inflome.
This study investigates the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis and cell survival in the developing Drosoph wing epithelium. The authors generate a rer knockout line with a 156bp deletion in the coding region and show that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eary initiation factor 2 (eIF2). They find that rer mutant cells are eliminated through cell competition, a process also observed in other mutants with proteotoxic stress. The study also shows that R1 levels are upregulated upon Myc overexpression, which alleviates proteotoxic stress and supports My-driven growth. The results suggest that R1 is a regulator of proteasis in Doph and that its loss creates loser cells eliminated via competition. The study provides evidence for the conserved function of R1 across species, including yeast, worms, and mouse cortex, and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in My-driven cancers.
A study was conducted to evaluate the functional impact of 4,887 possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which encodes a protein kinase involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage response. A library of all possible CHE2 SNVs was created using error-prone PCR and screened for ability to complement yeast rad53 mutants. Next-generation sequencing identified an average of 0.86 SN per 1,000 bp, with similar distribution to previous studies. The library included 4,885 of 4,887 possible SNs in the 543 CHE2 open reading frame (ORF), all but one stop codon and one not detected in independent screens. Yeast transformants that grew in absence of rad53 were selected, and frequencies of remaining SNs determined by next-generation sequencing. For each SN, the average frequency before and after selection were compared, and a rad complementation score (RCS) calculated as log2 of ratio. Globally, 4,885 SNs were compared, one missing from library and another not detected. SNs were represented all one of 3,913 possible coding outcomes, including 195 codons, 530 synonymous, and 3,187 non-syn changes. Average RCS was -0.94, range -7.30-5.20. To test assertion that loss CHE2 function correlates with depletion, 30 variants were tested individually for rad complement. Variants not fully complementing rad in assays were more depleted in screen (RCS-3.64) than those fully complementing (R-0.76). Results correlated with ClinVar annotations, pathogenic variants were more depleted (R-3.15) than variants of uncertain (R-1.10) or conflicting (R-1). Stop codons were significantly depleted in rad complement screen, while synonymous were not. Several stop codons were outliers, with modest depletion. Validation showed that premature termination beyond residue 500 does not affect CHE2 ability to complement rad. Functional classification of 3,187 amino changes from non-syn SNs resulted in 770 damaging and 2,417 tolerated. A logistic model with RCS achieved 97.9% accuracy, correctly classifying stopons as damaging and synonymous as tolerated. The study provides additional functional data for CHE2 variants, which can be combined with other evidence for clinical classification.
This study reports the discovery of a new type II toxin-antitoxin system, Spx1-Ten, in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which regulates the epigenetic and phenotypic diversity of the bacterium. The system consists of toxin Ten and antitox S1, encoded by the sp1 and ten genes, respectively, which are co-transcribed as an operon. Ten is a 92-amino acid protein, and Spx1 is a 133-amino acid protein. The study shows that Ten is a toxin that targets the ribosome, interacting with Rim, a ribosome biogenesis chaper, to exert its toxicity, reducing the abundance of Com, an alternative sigma factor that activates competence genes for DNA uptake and processing. The reduced Com leads to enhanced expression of Psr, an invertase, shifting hS inversions in the cod locus towards non-hSA allelic configurations and methyl. The epigen changes result in phenotypic diversity, including colony morphology and other traits. The study also shows that spontaneous variations in the AT-rich region upstream the sp1 promoter control the balance of the Spx-T system, with low-trans AT variants neutralizing Ten's toxicity and high-trans variants unleashing it. The number of AT repeats defines the transcriptional expression of Ten and downstream events. The study provides a model of the Spx-T system and its role in pneumoccal epigen and phenotyp adaptation.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive principal component analysis (gcPCA) to compare two high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions. Traditional PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques operate on one dataset and cannot account for experimental conditions. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) was proposed to address this issue but requires a hyperparameter α, which determines how much covariance from the second condition to subtract from the first, and has multiple solutions with no way to know which is correct. The new method, gcPCA, eliminates the need for α by introducing a normalization to mitigate bias toward high-variance dimensions. It uses a factor to penalize high-variance, making it suitable for noisy and finitely sampled data. gc can be used for various applications, including neuronal recordings, high-dimensional omics, and single-cell RNA sequencing. In neuronal recordings, gc extracted hippocampal replay without prior knowledge of task-related activity. In single-cell sequencing, gc found transcriptomic heterogeneity in disease states. The method has two caveats: gcPCs are not orthogonal in original space but in normalized space, and normalization introduces possibility of numerical instability if denominator is rank-deficient. The authors provide an open-source toolbox for gc in Python and MATLAB.
Researchers developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells and tested it in different B lymphoma cell lines. They found a conserved network across cell lines, including previously undescribed links in BCR intracellular signaling, and confirmed known cross-talks and feedbacks. The RAF-MEKERK regulatory loop exists in BL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), while the negative impact of B-mediated p38 on this loop is a newly discovered cros found in three cell lines. The p38-MEKK cros might dampen excessive RAF-MEKK signaling. ER and p signaling are conserved across B lymphoma types, suggesting insights may apply to other B lymphomas. The mechanism of p38-MEK cros remains unclear, but it's not mediated by ER feedback or RAF sites. A study on HeLa cells showed direct binding of p38 to ER confers the cros. In this study, a link between mTOR and J and AK upstream of PIK/Btk is proposed. The qualitative wiring of the core B network is conserved across most cell lines, with few cell-specific characteristics. The conserved B model can be applied to antigen-driven B activation and B-driven cancer. A study compared CLL and non-malign B signaling found modest topology differences, recapitulated on a larger network for aberrant and non-aberr B receptor signaling.
The Notch receptor signaling pathway is essential for tissue growth and development, and its activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: transactivation and cis-inhibition. Transactivation is triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighboring cells, while cis-inhibition is mediated by ligands binding to receptors in the same cell. Different Notch receptor-ligand combinations elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling. This study explores the molecular basis of opposing actions of Not ligands DLL4 and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting. A combination of experimental and mathematical approaches provides evidence for two mechanisms: 1) DLL rather than J1 induces Notch receptor activation; 2) J1 blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition of Not signaling through formation of J1/DLL complex. A new model of Not signaling recapitulates formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting. The Notch receptor is a large, approximately 300kDa single-pass membrane receptor, with ligands also expressed on the cell surface. Its structure and function have remained relatively unchanged over time, despite variations in receptor and ligand family members. Not can directly activate transcription as part of DNA-bound complex, triggered by interaction between extracellular domain and ligands. Ligand binding causes biomechanical strain, exposing specific cleavage sites, leading to γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of intracellular domain, translocating to nucleus and stimulating target gene expression. Cis-inhibition is a regulatory mechanism blocking receptors in same cell. Net signaling is determined by relative strength of trans and cis processes. Features of transactivation have been detailed, but fundamental issues remain, such as cis mechanism and counteracting trans, and manifold receptor-lig combinations. Recent work dissected responses to different ligands, yielding distinct gene outcomes. Tissue-level example of divergent roles is sprouting, where DLL4 constrains sprouting by proangi properties of J1. In vivo, J functions by antagonizing DLL, highlighting possibility of cstalk/competition, but molecular details unknown. This study explores facets of Not signaling, specifically DLL and J control of Not1 receptor.
The article presents Dirichlet Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that uses uncertainty associated with data points. DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and clusters immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. DPM is used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised gene signatures, introducing a novel procedure for generating a summary of a signature on a different dataset to where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three gene expression datasets with patients with a range of IMD are clustered using DPM, with association between disease and clusters replicated across datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold: demonstrating that data uncertainty should inform clustering and presenting a method, DPM, and using gene signatures in datasets where they were not defined. Clustering by similarity has applications in bioinformatics, such as identifying subgroups of disease, inferring gene function, and clustering diseases. Common methods assume observations are observed without error or identically distributed, but data often have uncertainty, such as measurement error or multiple experts. DPM adapts a standard Dirich process model to data with uncertainty, showing accounting for uncertainty alters clustering solutions and outperforming comparators on simulated and real data. DPM provides clustering and uncertainty about clustering, captured by posterior similarity matrix, which is well-calibrated. DPM is used to summarise genetic associations by diseases using polygenic scores, identifying six clusters, including autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Gene signatures are used to cluster patients with IMD, finding clusters associated with disease in majority cases. DPM without uncertainty produces similar clusterings, but accounting for uncertainty reveals biologically meaningful.
Deep neural networks have been successful models of the primate visual system, but fail to account for the strong dependence of primate vision on shape. Humans rely heavily on shape when judging category membership, whereas networks rely more on features like color and texture. This problem has been documented, but the underlying reasons unclear. We designed artificial datasets where shape, color, and features can be used to predict image class, and trained networks from scratch to classify with single features and combinations. Some networks failed to learn shape, while others used it in principle but were biased towards other features. We analyzed the dynamics of networks through the neural kernel (TK) during training and found that color and texture-selective networks had clusters of images with similar gradients, whereas shape-selective networks had fewer. This explains why networks are biased towards color and texture. The TK of a network trained on full dataset was more similar to color- and texture-trained than shape-trained networks. The structure of the TK showed clusters of images with similar gradients for color and texture, but not shape. We repeated the analysis with a network with spatial competition, which reduced the prevalence of these clusters and improved shape selectivity. Our results suggest that the bias arises from the dynamics of gradient learning, specifically the alignment of gradients with image features. This can be changed by altering the learning rule or loss. Self-supervised learning can reduce bias, but still relies on mini-batch descent. Combining networks with an explicit memory may help discover more complex features like shape. The ventral stream may not be sensitive to shape, and the lack of sensitivity in deep models matters. The goal is to build an explanatory bridge between task, neural, data, and behavior. We used artificial images to investigate why networks develop a bias towards color and texture. Some architectures, like transformers, appear unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks can. The bias arises from learning, not architecture. The TK analysis identified a mechanism for the bias: groups of images with gradients that increase sensitivity to color and texture, but not shape. This opens opportunities to improve models of visual processing in the brain.
This study presents a rule-based model of hepatic stellate (H) cell (HSC) dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion using the Kappa language, a site rewriting formalism. HSC are modeled as agents with 3 sites: cell state, TGFβ binding, and TGF receptor state. The model includes 75-77 rules and 37-41 parameters, depending on the family. Rules describe H activation, differentiation, proliferation, and collagen production. HSC are characterized by 7 states: quiescent, activated, myofiblast, inactivated, reactivated, reactivated, and apoptotic senescent. The model predicts the reactivation loop, dynamics of inactivated cells, and accumulation during fib progression. Validation was performed in a mouse model of C4-induced fibrosis and RNA sequencing from patients with fibrosis. The study demonstrates the applicability of Kappa to multi-scale modeling using tokens to represent quantities and counters to abstract cell phenotypes. The model provides biological predictions for the reactivation, loop, dynamics of inactivated, and accumulation during fib progression, validated experimentally and clinically.
A novel meta-analysis framework is proposed for estimating the total effect of high-dimensional mediators in large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program. The framework requires only summary statistics and accounts for between-study heterogeneity. It incorporates iterative Independence Screening (iIS) and Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP) (iIS-MCP) to filter out non-mediators, followed by False Discovery Rate (FDR) control to exclude nonedi and noise variables. The two-stage cross-fitted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) procedure, CFOLS, is applied to estimate the total effect. Depending on the heterogeneity test, either fixed-effects or random meta-analysis is performed. Simulations demonstrate that the efficiency and coverage using summary statistics are comparable to individual-level data in fixed meta-analysis, with a minimum sample size of 300 per study. The proposed method is applied to the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and Multi-Ethic Study Atherosclerosis (ESA) cohorts to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure (BP) and sex-related high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The results align with individual-level data, highlighting the efficiency of the method in handling large-scale studies. The framework is applicable to mediation in large biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, and can be an alternative to analysis of the entire dataset once in terms of computational feasibility. The total effect measure, R2, can characterize the overall effect and individual mediators. A modified measure, R2, is proposed to adjust for covari and confounders. The method is applied to a single gene, ABC1, selected in 4 out of 5 cohorts, highlighting heterogeneity in mediator selection challenges. The total effects captured by R2 are consistent across cohorts, despite different genes selected, revealing biological mechanisms at transcript and pathway levels.
Researchers have developed a novel method called PWH (Prioritizing Personalized Cancer Genes via Random Walks on Hyper) to identify driver genes that contribute to cancer initiation and progression in individual patients. PWH uses unsupervised learning and leverages genome and transcriptome data from a cohort to predict personalized driver genes. The method introduces the concept of hypergraph random walks to predict driver genes, which offers benefits in data integration and interpretability by grouping patient-specific mutated and abnormally expressed genes within hyperedges. PWH focuses on prioritizing single genes, but often collaborate to drive cancer initiation and progression. The model primarily focuses on point mutations, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels), due to prevalence, ease of detection, and potential genetic markers for phenotypes that promote tumor formation. PWH demonstrated reliable performance in inferring driver genes, promising discovering causal variants obscured by tumor heterogeneity. The method uses two types of genomic data: somatic mutation and gene expression, downloaded from 16 cancer datasets with sufficient samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal. Somatic data includes non-synonymous point mutations and insertions/deletions (indels) in coding regions, and gene expression profiles. PWH uses a gene network: global protein-protein interaction (PPI) taken from STRING. The network includes 170 genes and 394 interactions. The method normalizes gene expression by z-score and identifies abnormally expressed genes for each patient with a threshold. PWH constructs a weighted hypermodel to capture implicit similarity and association between mutated and abnormally genes. The hyperedge weight is increased with correlation to the target sample. PWH views gene network as undirected, projecting mutant and abnormally genes onto human interaction. Vertices in hyper induce corresponding interaction subnetworks. The weight of node in hyper is its degree in the subnetwork. A random walk on hyper is similar to classic walk, transitions between incident vertices in hyper. PWH uses a damping factor to ensure ergodic conditions. The method converges within 10 iterations. PWH scores are preserved and normalized to generate PWH-scores. PWHcores are ranked to prioritize candidate genes. PWH uses benchmark measures: recapitulation of well-stud general-associated genes and tumor-specific genes. The general list includes 758 cancer genes from Cancer Census, Hi cancer panels, high drivers, and Mut genes. PWH scores are compared with six methods: Dawn, Proy, S, Persona, Drive, Degree, and Frequency. PWH outperforms in precision, recall, and F-score. PWH uses receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and areas under curve (AUC) to evaluate true and false rates.
This study presents the Virtual Epileptic (VEP) model, a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities, capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG. The study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, the SaCe, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, yielding high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. Through benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using a Bayesian framework for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, a scalable quantification phase was added to the model, assessing variability in estimated parameters across problems. The study aims to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. Achieving accuracy in predictive modeling poses a challenge in inferring information from data, such as characterizing brain networks from sterelect EEG data. Optimizing parameters is essential for gaining insights into mechanisms of data-generating in pathological conditions, like dynamics and connectivity of abnormal networks. Approaches have evolved in epilepsy surgery, moving beyond the concept of epileptic focus, proposing definitions of zones (e.g., epileptogenic, seizure, onset, and irritative). In epilepsy, seizures originate from a network of hyperitable regions, the epileptogenic zone (EZ), then propagating to a connected network, the propagation zone (P). Defining EZ based on sterelect EEG can be difficult due to complex patterns of onset and spread, influenced by network dynamics. Success of surgical interventions depends on precision and reliability of initial hypotheses, e.g., spatial EZ/PZ map and seizure organization. VEP is a digital approach integrating modeling abnormal activity with patient-specific anatomical data, predicting brain involved in seizure generation and propagation. Accurately capturing seizure dynamics and computer simulations resembling intracran EEG, this offers a platform to optimize strategy and aid decision-making. V is a model-based relying on estimating parameters in high-dimensional space to identify EZ/P in the brain. Issues of sparsity, stochasticity, and scalability of prediction are due to non-trivial brain effects, non-linearity in spatiemporal organization, and uncertainty in components. Studies have demonstrated advancements in accurate estimation of V parameters, informed decision-making and surgical strategies.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major global health problem with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Infection with Mtb results in heterogeneous disease outcomes, including bacterial clearance, persistence, and active disease with or without cavitation. Studies suggest that a quarter to a third of the world's population has evidence of M infection, but most are not at risk to develop active disease. Individuals who progress to TB seem to do so within 1-2 years after exposure. Studying TB progression in humans is difficult as most exposed do not develop disease, requiring long-term cohort studies. Most of what is known about within Mtb dynamics after early infection comes from animal studies. Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of TB and replication of M during acute and chronic stages remains poorly understood. Mtb can persist non-replicating in tissues under hypoxic conditions, which may resist antibiotic killing. Studies in mice infected with aerosol with conventional M (100 CFU) have shown bacterial numbers increase during acute phase but static during chronic infection. This was defined as "equilibrium" where bacteria remain viable but do not divide. In contrast, studies in zebraf mice reported M enters dynamic status and replicates during chronic infection. Isoniaz has been used to treat M infection in humans and mice, suggesting M are not dormant but replicate, and constancy is due to balance between M replication and death. A study addressed static in mouse model used H37v of M transformed with unstable plasm p10, a "replication plasm". Plasm was lost at constant rate with cell division in vitro, allowing count divisions over time. Combining data with total bacteria and percent plasm-bearing, they estimated M division and death during first 110 days in M infection lungs. They found M replicates substantial during chronic, 4-fold lower than acute, challenging concept M enters dormancy. We have shown plasm probability influences estimates M replication and death and quantified fraction non-replic bacteria. Recent work used ratio of short- vs long ribosomal RNA (RS) confirmed M may replicate during chronic. Infection B6 mice with M is widely used model but has limitations, such as high doses and small lung size. In contrast, rabbits exposed similar doses develop localized lesions that progress to well-cums granulomas, due to larger lung size. We used clinical isolate H878 with plasm p10 to infect rabbits via aerosol and measured total and pl-bearing in lungs over time. Percent pl-bearing did not decline monotonically as expected, increasing between 28 and 56 post-infection. A single-population model was not consistent with data, two- and three-pop with different kinetics allowed to fit better. Stochastic simulations in one-pop model did not match data, suggesting cannot explain nonot change in percent pl-bearing. Measuring pl-bearing in granulomas should estimate M replication and death.
A new glycan modeling algorithm, GlyTreeer, was developed to computationally build glycans layer-by-layer using kernel density estimates of glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. The algorithm was benchmarked on a set of glycan structures varying in length and structure, and predicted native structures with high accuracy for both de novo and density-guided modeling. Glyer was used to design glycans onto a protein vaccine scaffold to shield regions from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. The work informs glycoprotein prediction, glycan masking, and computational structure determination. Carbohydrates and glycoproteins are ubiquitous in organisms, with viral glycoproteins using N-linked glycosylation as an immune evasion strategy. However, broadly neutralizing antibodies often target glycans as part of epitopes. Glyans can improve stability, solubility, reduce aggregation, and improve drug targeting and vaccine design through glycan masking. The biosynthesis of glycojugates is complex, with carbohydrates attached to amino acids through coval modification, forming glycoprote. The attachment can be to nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon atoms (N, O, or C-linked glycosylation), each involving multiple enzymes and sugar structures. Processes are stochastic, producing glyrote heterogeneous in occupancy and chemical makeup. The common form of glycosylation is N-linked glycosylation, initiated during translation by oligoschtransferase OST, recognizing a consensus sequon and attaching a lipid-linked coreoligoschar to aspar residue. The process is not deterministic, with certain amino acids affecting efficiency. Upon protein folding, the initial gly is trimmed and processed in the Golgi apparatus. The chemical makeup depends on enzymes available, influenced by species, disease, stage, and local sequence. Glyans are conformationally flexible, exposed, with many degrees of freedom. Accurate modeling is difficult due to chemistry and conformation diversity. A new gly modeling algorithm, GlyTreeer, was developed to computationally build glycans layer-by-layer using density estimates and QM calculations. The was benchmarked on a set glycan structures, predicting native with accuracy for de novo and density-guid modeling. Gly was used to design glycans onto a vaccine scaffold to shield from antibody, and experimentally verified.
The study investigates the role of the F-box protein F23 (Fbx23) in regulating the transcription factor Ace1 (Ace) in the fungus Penicillium oxalicum (P. oxum). F23 is a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which recognizes and ubiquitinates Ace, leading to its degradation. In the absence of F23, Ace accumulates and loses its ability to bind to target genes. The study shows that F23 is essential for Ace's DNA-binding activity, suggesting it acts as a transcriptional coactivator of Ace. The SCF complex influences Ace's activity and stability through proteolytic and non-proteic pathways. The study also shows that F23 has other substrates besides Ace, contributing to its pleiotropic effects. The study uses various methods, including tandem affinity purification mass spectrometry (T-MS), yeast two-hybrid (YH), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to investigate the interaction between F23 and Ace. The results show that F23 interacts with Ace in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the interaction is necessary for Ace's DNA-binding activity. The study also shows that the absence of F23 leads to downregulation of genes involved in asexual development and upregulation of hemi cellulase genes under cellulose. The study provides insights into the role of F23 in regulating Ace and its substrates in P. ox.
The study investigates the mechanisms of basement membrane (BM) formation and diversification in the Drosoph melanogaster follicular epithelium. BM is a critical for tissue development, homeostasis, and regeneration, and is composed of conserved components such as type IV collagen, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and glycoproteins lamin and nidogen. During development, the interplay between cells and BM participates in sculpting organs and maintaining shape. BM influences cellular processes such as cell identity, growth, shape, and migration through surface receptors like integrins. Cells constantly produce and remodel BM, modifying their mechanical and biochemical environment. Protein secretion involves large complexes like procollagen that transit the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, but little is understood how BM proteins reach the cell surface and routes are spatiemporally integrated in developing tissues. The study uses Doph melanogaster as a tractable system to study BM biology. The ovary consists of ovarles, each with a succession of follicles that develop to a mature egg. Each follic comprises a gerine surrounded by a monayer of somatic epithelial follic cells, polarized with the apical facing gerine and basal contacting the BM. Major BM components are synthesized and secreted by follicle cells. Factors implicated in this process have been identified, including small GTPases Rab10 and Rab8, and their guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) C and Stratum. Loss of these factors leads to mistargeting a fraction of BM towards the apical domain, indicating classical trafficking is involved in assembly. However, it is unclear if these factors act together or in parallel. The study determines the molecular and cell sites of BM protein secretion in the follicular epithelium. Rab10 and Rab define parallel routes for BM secretion, with Rab promoting lateral and basal secretion, respectively. Dystroph-associated complex (DAP) and exocyst complex are involved in these routes, with AP required for fibril formation and exyst for basal secretion. Ex70, a subunit of exyst, interacts with Dys and modulates its localization, and is required for basal secretion. The study provides mechanistic insights into BM secretion and diversification, proposing coexistence of secretory routes with cell sites defined by polarity axes.
Researchers developed a machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The model, called the language-based universal (LB) model, is a type of multi-task learning (MTL) model. It was pre-trained on Env sequences without neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with both non-bAb and Ab data. The LB's performance was comparable to Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF) models, with some improvements over both. Unlike other methods, the LB does not require aligning input sequences, which is an advantage given Env's incredible variability. The model was trained to predict in vitroAb resistance, not validated with clinical outcomes, and relied on correlations between in vitro susceptibility bn and in vivo. A systematic comparison between methods requires testing different preprocessing, feature selection, and learning algorithms. The LB was compared to RF and GB models because boosting and trees underlie published methods without neural networks. The model was pre-trained as a two-layer bidirectional Long-Term (LSTM) model. The outputs of concatenation layers for each site in sequence were input to a dense layer with a softmax function, outputting a distribution over 20 amino acids and tokens. The model was fine-tuned with attention, incorporating antibody vectors through a mechanism combining three methods. The LB's loss was the average of binary cross-entropy and mean error. The model was evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation, not nested for GB and RF. For each fold, an additional 5 cross-validation was performed on training to select hyperparameters. The LB was implemented in Tensor Keras (v2.12.0). The model's performance was compared to RF and GB models, which required aligning sequences. The LB did not require aligning and removed non-amino characters from input. The LB's architecture was rationalized in the results section. The model was pre-trained for 50 epochs, each corresponding to predictions for all sites in training. The model with lowest cross-entropy was used downstream. The LB was fineuned with 362 antibodies for IC-based models and 99 for IC-based models. The model context was visualized with Uniform Approximation and Projection (U) algorithm. A secondary layer was added to predict log (IC) or log(IC) depending on phenotype. The model's loss was weighted binary crossentropy and mean error. The model was evaluated with 5 cross-validation, not nested for GB and RF. The LB's performance was compared to RF and GB models, which required aligning. The LB did not require align and removed non-am characters from input. The LB's architecture was rationalized in results. The model was pre-trained for 50 epochs, each corresponding predictions all sites training. The model lowest crossentropy was used downstream. The LB was fineuned with 362 for IC models and 99 IC models. The context was visualized with U algorithm. A layer was added to predict log or log depending phenotype. The model's loss was binary cross and error. The model was evaluated with cross, not GB and RF.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that dysfunction of pathways is closely associated with disease development and progression. This study considered two strategies that construct models by pathway information: pathway method and grouplasso. The former converted gene expression to pathway scores for fitting. Three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GSVA, and z-score) and 14 databases providing information were used. Implemented in microarray data MM (GSE324), a candidate model with best performance in validation was obtained. The model was compared with gene-based and published models in external data. Grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) was more competitive than gene model in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including V, seemed more predictive for MM. Vax also outperformed previously published models. The new model was more resistant to missing values, and presence <5% would not deteriorate its accuracy using missing imputation. Pathway-based models using grouplasso were competitive to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMMs/MM), where missing imputation was integrated for future validation.
A nonlinear dynamical system model of Drp-dependent mitochondrial fission was developed to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the process. The model, called the Fission Model, focuses on the recruitment and oligomerization of Drp tetramers with mitochondrial fission factor (M) on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). The system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) tracks the concentration of Drp tetramers, M, and oligomers of various sizes, and the total fission rate (FR) as a function of time. The FR is defined as the number of fission events per second. The model undergoes Hop bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + k - M, where k and k are association and dissociation rates between Drp-M oligomers on the OM, and M is the total concentration of M on the OM. The cumulative fission (TF) is the total number of fission over a set period and depends strongly on μ. Variations in k, k, and M cause the FR to transition from damped oscillations to sustained oscillations. The cumulative TF also depends on these parameters, with largest values occurring when k and M are large. A variance-based sensitivity analysis showed that k, k, and M contribute most to the variation in TF, with second-order interactions between k and k and between k and M. The dimensionless F Model was nondimensionalized to investigate the effect of μ on the FR and TF. The dimensionless FR undergoes bifurcation with parameter μ, and the TF depends almost entirely on μ, indicating a possible reduction to a model depending only on μ.
A CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. A significant challenge for successful suppression is the rapid evolution of resistance. One approach to mitigate resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs. This study constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene system targeting the recessive female gene tyros decboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosila suuk, a fruit pest. Investigation revealed low homing in germl, but feeding octamine restored egg-laying in T2 mutants, allowing line maintenance for suppression targets. The effectiveness of a similar system in Drosila melanogaster was tested, with additional drive systems introducing promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing. Findings show genetic polymorphs in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and position profoundly influence Cas activity. This study highlights conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, offering a valuable tool for industrial-scale production of drivegenic insects.
The article explores the energy cost of learning in neural networks, specifically the brain, and artificial neural networks. Experiments have shown that learning is energetically costly, even for simple tasks, and large networks require significant energy. The brain has evolved to be energy-efficient in learning. A parsimonious energy model proposes two plasticity algorithms: 1) only modify synapses with large updates and 2) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In networks, backprop updates all synapses, but restricting plasticity can save energy while incurring slightly worse learning. The algorithms might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a match between artificial and biological learning. Energy is a necessity for organisms, and the nervous system is an intensive consumer, consuming 20% of basal metabolism. Requirements of neural signaling are seen as a design constraint of the brain. Sparse codes and connectivity can lower requirements, but learning is also energetically costly. The cost of learning in flies is estimated at 10J/bit. In mammals, there is evidence that energy gates lasting forms of plasticity and a correlation between metabolism and memory. The authors hypothesize that neural plasticity is designed to be energy-efficient. An energy measure is introduced that assumes energy is used by synaptic updates, ignoring costs of transmission and number of synapses. The measure can be reduced while maintaining learning performance. The study uses artificial networks as a model of neural learning, trained with backprop, which is an abstraction of biological learning but can teach complex associations not matched by biological algorithms. Biological implementations of backprop have been suggested but are likely less efficient. In neural research, there is interest in limiting plasticity for preventing overwriting previously stored information and regularization. The memory is also energetically costly in hardware, storing 32-bit in DRAM is more expensive than multiplying. Algorithms have started to reduce costs by limiting updates to weight matrices. The MNIST task is used, with 28x28 grey images classified to digits, and results found on fashionMN data. The network has 784 input units, variable hidden units, and 10 output units, with all-to-all non-convolution connectivity and leaky rectifying activation. The network is trained with backprop, weights initialized with small values, and energy depends weakly on it. The measures of energy, M0 and M1, depend on the number of updates and absolute changes of synapses, respectively.
This study investigated the evolution of Acinetobacter bayi AD1x strains with reduced genomes during ~300-generation experiments in complex and defined media. The engineered deletions significantly decreased fitness in one or both media, but most strains gained fitness after evolution, except for two that failed to recover in one environment (M9 in LB and 4 MS). Mutations recurrently occurred in specific environments and strain backgrounds, likely compensating for lost functions. In MS, mutations in RNase (rnd) were common, while in LB, a variety of pathways were overrepresented. Associations were found between Abs28 small RNA and M6 LB, rD M12 LB, zC znu MSD1 LB, and ACAD7 MSD2 LB. Mutations in competence and extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis genes were similar to previous studies. The most mutated genes were post-transcription regulators csr, rnd, and hf, which interact with small RNAs. Mutations rnd were more common in MS, and csr associated with ancestors like 9 in MS. Deleting rnd increased fitness by 7.4% on average in MS-evolved strains and 1.2% in LB. Large duplications occurred in five strains, including the ACAD1/AC2 intergenic region, which had pre-existing mutations and new during evolution in LB. Fitness recovery of reduced-genome A. bayi can be used to streamline and test compensatory mutations. Strains with deletions 4 and 9 had fitness defects and failed to recover, making these regions dead for minimal A. bayi engineering.
Researchers developed a self-cleaving ribyme tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebraf. They used an in vivo strategy to show that inserting the T3-H ribyme in an intron enables pre-mRNA cleavage with up to 20-fold reduction in expression. This ribyme displays superior activity compared to other ribymes. The T-H ribyme was inserted in the second intron of the alb gene using CRPR/C9 and observed pigmentation similar to the mutant. A base-editing to inactivate the ribyme showed the phenotype is reversible. A Flipp- and Cre-activatable version of the ribyme, called Ribo, was generated to control mRNA levels of the alb gene. Ribo activation induced knockdown and recapitulated the mutant phenotype. A Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in Ribo cassette labeled cells independently of target expression. The Ribo is introduced as a flexible tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrates and an alternative to existing knock strategies.
This study introduces aiSEG, a user-friendly software for segmenting nuclei in bright-field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. Previous research has shown that neural networks can detect nuclei and cell organelles in transmitted images under optimized conditions. The study demonstrates that segmentations in BF are feasible in challenging conditions like low magnification and time-lapse imaging of small primary murine and human hematopoietic cells in microfluid and culture devices. aiSEG segmentations are similar to manual, retaining biologically meaningful information for quantification of noisy biosensors like cell dynamics. The software frees a fluorescent channel, enabling exploration of additional markers or reduction of phototoxicity and imaging times. aiSEG adds biological information to experiments constrained by poorophore markers in existing transgenic models. Specifically, it explores the effect of NF-κB dynamics on differentiation of GMP and cell cycle as a covariate. Other pathways like ER in ESC change response depending on phases, but not in this study. aiSEG enables new workflows and utility in investigating multiple pathways, markers, and variables. The model generalizability is a sought feature in trained networks, crucial for democratizing access to state-of-the-art machine learning. Conventionally, large models are trained on vast data to obtain generalizability, but microscopy data are diverse and siloed. To address this, crowdsourcing and retraining with user data have been suggested. aiSEG pretrained on a large set requires approximately 32 images to improve for new cases, making it feasible for users with little resources and access to state-of-art segmentation. Data are shared in FA repositories to advance computer vision and disseminate applications.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on a "slown prior" when learning in a decision-making task with stimuli composed of one reward-predict and reward-ir features. Participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the rewardredict feature changed slowly and the feature quickly, compared to when the opposite. After learning, participants generalised values to new stimuli equally in both conditions. Models with different learning rates showed participants adjusted to the speed of features, with learning rates for relevant features mediating the effect. The study suggests humans employ a slown prior to identify relevant features during reinforcement learning, aiding task representation in the reinforcement domain. The findings relate to broader discussion on how the brain solves learning problems, with representation implemented in parallel to reinforcement using feedback or replay mechanisms. Inductive biases may bias beliefs about relevant features, reducing reliance on online computation, narrowing options through selective attention. The results align with previous studies on slown prior and raise questions about origins, whether priors are learned or meta-learned. The task posed a challenge to participants, containing elements to test hypothesis and provide a controlled bed for dimensionality. The winning model assigned rates to features based on speed and relevance from the first trial of the block, assuming participants quickly developed a sense of relevance. The study provides empirical evidence for the role of slown in learning and connects to machine findings, shedding light on how humans learn representations in complex environments.
A study investigated the role of RES1, a poorly characterized gene, in breast cancer metastasis. RES1 was identified as a tumor suppressor in ER-negative breast cancer, with lower expression associated with worse outcomes in human data and mouse models. RES1 depletion increased tumor growth and metastasis in autochous models, but reduced metastasis in allog models. Mechanistic studies showed RES1 associated with ribosomal biogenesis, but not global translation or protein production. BioAP analysis revealed RES1 binding to ribosomal repeats, non-coding RNAs, and exons protein-coding genes, particularly ribosomal components. RES1 depletion modestly affected transcriptome, with 1.2-1.5 fold changes for all polymerases. EMT pathways were suppressed in RES1-depleted tumors, favoring proliferation and potentially reducing metastasis. The study suggests RES1 as a tumor suppressor in ER breast cancer, with complex roles in ribosomal biogenesis and EMT.
This study investigates the impact of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins Mec1 and Rad24 on meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meiotic recombination is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid cells for sexual reproduction, and is essential for fertility in sexually reproducing organisms. Mec1 and Rad24 are involved in the DDR pathway, which monitors and responds to DNA damage, including double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination. The study uses a combination of genetic and genomic approaches to analyze the effects of Mec and Rad on meiotic recombination. The results show that both Mec and Rad limit recombination frequency and prevent the formation of multi-DS events, supporting the view that Mec mediates DS interference. However, the phenotypes of Mec and Rad mutants differ, indicating separable roles for the proteins. Mec is a regulator of recombination frequency, while Rad is a pro-C factor. The study also shows that loss of Mec and Rad leads to increased non-ex chromosomes, which are likely due to defects in spatial regulation of DS formation and patterning. The results suggest that Mec and Rad have overlapping and distinct functions in meiotic recombination. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of meiotic recombination and DDR, and highlights the importance of Mec and Rad in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and fertility in sexually reproducing organisms.
Researchers have developed a genome-scale metabolic model for Pneumocyst, a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. The model is based on the mouse-specific pathogen Pocyst mur, but can be linked to other Pocyst species and their mammalian hosts. Pneumyst has a reduced genome and relies on host for nutrients and environment, requiring special attention in model development. The model includes 487 reactions and 495 enzymes, with stoichiometry sourced from RHE database. Transport reactions were added to simulate growth in Meral's culture medium. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) was used to calculate fluxes under conditions, with a relaxed quasi-stead state assumption. The model was tested with MEM, a comprehensive model testing tool, showing high stoichi consistency, mass, and charge balance, and metabolite connectivity. In vitro culture conditions by Meral et al were used to simulate the model. Reinforcement Learning (RL) was applied to optimise medium composition, finding a minimal subset of 37 nutrients from 155 without dropping biomass value. The model can be used for antifungal targets and new therapies, and advances in Pocyst biology and therapy.
Researchers developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TA pathway to investigate whether increased YAP/TA levels in cancer cells can sustain proliferation under high-density conditions. The model simulated cell-cell interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) and reaction equations, accounting for adhesion, repulsion, and friction forces between cells. The study found that a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest and enable continuous proliferation under high-density conditions. The model, integrating cell dynamics and intra-cellular, provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of cell density and Y/TA concentration on proliferation, contributing to understanding the proliferative characteristics of normal and cancer cells. In normal tissues, exponential growth was suppressed, while in cancer cells with elevated Y/TA levels continued to proliferate exponentially. The study suggests that YTA plays a pivotal role in regulating proliferation in oncogenic contexts. The model can be used to evaluate malignancy, explore interventions targeting YTA, and optimize drug dosages.
The article discusses the role of low-complex domains (LCD) in eukaryotic proteins, which are characterized by conformation flexibility and phase separation into biomolecular condates. LCDs are essential for promuous binding and phase separation, but their functional and evolutionary origins are poorly understood. The sequences of phase-separ biomolecules are not random, but follow specific patterns that promote fluidity and dynamics of condates. Misregulation of material properties leads to loss of fluidity and transition to solid states associated with diseases. A Free Landscape of Stickers (FELS) framework was devised to explore LCD patterns that encode material properties and stability. FLS provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties, where features are conserved while sequences are variable. Using FLS, the complexity of LCD quantified periodicity and disorder impacts dynamics and material of condates. Periodic LCDs display local structure and inhomogeneities, while random sequences are homogeneous and viscous. Phase diagrams and dynamical properties corroborate rheological trends, with periodic LCD elastic and viscosity increasing with periodicity. Structurally, interactions periodic LCD result in oscillatory decay correlations. Selfanove analysis reveals glassy states with high periodic LCD. Varying densities, spherical micelle structures form at low densities, transitioning to elongated micelles at higher densities, and branched perated micelles at greater concentrations. The study addresses the critical role of sequence in dynamics and material of biomolecular condates, anticipating experiments guided by landscape will enable targeted mutations to alter characteristics.
The development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, hair follicles, and glands, is a morphogenetic process that transforms simple epithelia into multilayered structures with distinct morphologies. The process begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesyme to form a shaped structure, which undergoes further invagination and organ-specific changes. Epith invagination is a basic module for building epithelial organs, and disruption in this process underlies genetic disorders causing ectermal dysgenesis. The mouse has served as a model for understanding epith morphogenesis. At embryonic day (E) 11, the dental placode emerges as a thickened stripe on the oral surface, marking the earliest sign of tooth formation. The plac then enlarges and invinates into the condensing mesyme, forming incisor and molar buds by E 12.5.5. Tooth space separates these buds, and incisors and molars undergo morphological changes as they invinate into mesyme, progressing through cap and bell stages until eruption. Genetic studies in mice and humans have shown that transcription factors and signaling pathways play critical roles during tooth development, but how they modulate cell behaviors to morph is beginning to be understood. Recent studies have unveiled coordinated patterns of cell and movement during epithelial invagination. At onset, epithelial protrusions at the apical surface are centripally oriented and push cells downwards to deform the epithelium. Epithelial cells divide to produce supasal cells and F signaling in the germ drives cell proliferation and plac stratification. Supasal cells of invinating epithium are motile and migrate towards the toothline interating with each other. Epithelial in hair and mammary placodes undergo convergent movement, and motilities in these are influenced Wnt and Sh signaling pathways. It was postulated that convergent movement generates plan tissue tension in the supasal and required for invagination. However, the molecular mechanism enabling cell rearrangement and directional movement is unclear. Cells generate forces primarily by interaction between filament actin and motor myosin II (MyII). MyII is composed of six subunits: two light chains, two regulatory chains, and two heavy chains. Three isoforms of My heavy chains are present in mice: IIA, IIB, and IIC, encoded by My9, 10, and 14. These isoforms play distinct and overlapping functions regulate motility, arrangement, and adhesion during morph. Mutations in regulators upstream controlling My activity, including GTP-activating proteins (GAPs) and small GTPases, have been linked to dental anomalies in humans. Whether My is required in epith to control its invagination and shape is unknown. This study investigates the functional of My in the dynamic organization of the mouse incisor. Combining explant and in vivo studies, My is essential for tooth development and epithelial invagination. It does so by strengthening-cell adhesion at adherens junctions and enabling persistent convergent cell movement in the supasal. Sh signaling controls these processes by activating My through PIK/AKT.
The article presents a novel deep transfer learning-based model, scGC, for integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scAC-se) data. The model leverages a graph convolutional network to aggregate cell-cell and gene relationships, enabling the transfer of labels from scRNA-se to scAC-se as a domain adaptation problem in transfer learning. scGC incorporates common information from both modalities through a semi-supervised paradigm, learning unlabeled scAC-se data, achieving high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities. The authors demonstrate scGC's performance on various single-cell datasets, including the Tabula Muris atlas and Cusan et al.'s scAC-se atlas, and multimodal data from CITEq and ASAPq techniques. They show that scGC accurately assigns 83.7% of cells to their correct types, outperforming Seurat, Con, scJoint, and GL. Additionally, scGC exhibits higher cell silhouette coefficients, mod silhouette, and F1 scores compared to other methods. The authors also integrate large-scale atlas data from mouse atlases, showcasing sc's ability to enhance annotations and provide novel labels to AC cells. They observe that sc consistently assigns labels to cells in proximity within AC space, exhibiting a higher degree of consistency compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, sc identifies new clusters of cells initially labeled 'unknown' or 'endothelial' as'strom cells. The authors conclude that sc is a novel, end-to-end framework for integrating unpaired single-cell multi-omics with accuracy and robustness, leveraging om-specific autoencoders, convolution networks, and transfer learning. They provide evidence that sc can transfer type annotations across tissues, species, and molecular layers, and facilitate identification of new subtypes.
This study investigates the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mcm3 subunit of the replicative helicase, a crucial for cell growth and chromatin loading. Mc3's N is a monopart LS, rich in basic amino acids, but lacks a universally conserved sequence. Mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling reveal that precise positioning of basic residues within the N is critical for nuclear transport through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import, resulting in defective chromatin loading and poor growth. Results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which, despite lacking a consensus, retain shared characteristics between Ns of Mc3 and SV40 large T antigen. Mc3's N is essential and conserved in fungi, with K768 playing a critical role in cell viability, while R769 plays a secondary role, and K, K, K, and R contribute when R is mutated. The K-K-K-K motif is not a consensus for monart N, as variants like Mc3R771 can localize. AF offers a new approach to evaluate monart Ns, considering a basic at P2, surrounded by at least two basics, and distant residues can contribute. Mutations in P and P result in defective import, chromatin, and growth. The Mc3-SV-NLSR mutant fails to import, despite AF predicting similar Kap contacts, possibly due to residue distinction between lysine and arginine.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism. The protein is a therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. ATN encodes a protein that functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of mNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Previous work has shown that the LSm-like domain of AT antagonizes mNP assembly. This study advances these findings through experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE) co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 may be a major determinant of mRNA and protein content Atin- mNPules. Experiments with transgenic Doph indicate that the LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At-induced cytotoxicity. The data lead to a proposal for howin interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of R-gran condensation as well as neurodegeneration. mNPules are dynamic, membrane-less organelles containing translationally repressed mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), molecular chaperones, and various cellular proteins. Formation of mNP assemblies is determined by base-pair interactions between mRN, protein interactions, and RBP-RNA interactions, whose contributions vary across granules and physiological states. Stress granules (SGs) are well-stud granules that form when cellular signals mediated byIFα activation cause mRN to arrest in translation and condense into multiNP assemblies. Mutations inNP proteins, including T-43, F, Atin, Atin, hnPA, hnPA1, WS, have been associated with ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The regulation and functions of SG have been topics of fundamental and clinical interest. The intermolecular interactions forNP assembly and precise sequence they occur are not elucidated. However, studies show that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) onNP proteins substantially contribute toNP assembly. Biochemical experiments show ID can phase into liquid-like assemblies. Activities of ID can be regulated posttranslationally, allowing physiological and spatial control over assembly and disassembly. ID can also transition into solid, beta-rich amyloid fibrils in vitro, particularly at high concentrations in the liquid phase. Studies showing inhibitors ofIFα or downstream events, including SG formation, can be protective in animal models neurode disease have led a conceptual framework: (a)NP provide a microenvironment for pathogenic seeds to form and grow; (b) misfolded loads result in inclusion, chronic signalling, reduced translation; (c) demand on handling systems results in multiple defects, notably membrane organel. Aberrant SG also results in transport defects contributing cell and toxicity. Strong support for the roleNP in disease comes from studies Atin. Loss of Atin is cyrotective in T-43, Doph T-43, C9F, Tau models cytotoxic. Mouse models for SC2 or ALS, genetic loss of ATN or delivery antisense oligonucleotides (AS) targeting ATN in the nervous system reduced T-43, increased survival, improved function. Observations have led AS against ATN being developed and approved clinical trials. Recent genome screens using siRNA and CRISPR have identified strategies to lower Atin levels. Givenin's therapeutic significance and multiple biology, it is important to determine which activities are relevant to disease and functions. Across species, Atin has conserved regions: L-like (L), L-associated (LA), and P2, flanked by
This study investigated the role of Pitx and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells (Mu) in extraocular (EOM) muscles, which are spared in muscular dystrophies. The authors found that Pitx is required for the specification of Mu in the EOM, but dispensable postnatally. They also showed that Pax is necessary for the maintenance of Mu in the E, but not in limb muscles. Pitx binds to the promoters of My5 and Myod, but it is unclear if it directly activates Pax or other transcription factors. The study suggests a unique regulatory network for E specification and differentiation, where My5 and Mr4 are upstream, and Pitx cannot override their role. The authors also found that Mu in the E have a higher content of Pax+ cells, but not per fibre, compared to TA, and a lower fraction of committed myoblast. They propose that Pit2+ cells may represent a second progenitor population in E remodeling and regeneration. The study highlights the importance of Pit and Pax in the development and maintenance of Mu in the E, providing insights into the sparing of these muscles in muscular dystrophies.
This study proposes a novel algorithm called VOC-IN, which combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOC-IN emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and achieve accurate fitting. The algorithm can fit multi-source data effectively and can be applied in scenarios involving a single virus. In such cases, the multi-strain can be simplified to the SIR model with time-vary parameters. The authors applied VOC-IN to analyze data from two VOIs in British Columbia (BC) and internal institutions in Canada. VOC-IN demonstrated performance in simulating observed and unobserved dynamics, time-dependent inference, and short-term predictions. The results reveal variations in intensity of control implemented strategies across regions. VOC-IN performs well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data. The study aims to address the complexities of understanding and modeling transmission of Variants of Concern (VOCs) by integrating SIR model with neural networks. VOC-IN allows analysis of timeary characteristics of VOC, such as transmission rates, removal, and effective numbers. VOC-IN was applied to study spread of VOC in BC and its regions. Results indicate fitting align with real data, enabling short disease predictions. Parameters from neural are persuasive, and simulations using ODE validate accuracy. Effective reproduction in BC aligns with related research. The study integrates Physics-Informed Networks (PIN) with disease models, VOC-IN, a significant contribution. VOC-IN leverages data and physical governing disease to capture timeary nature. Approach enhances predictive and provides policymakers reliable frameworks. VOC-IN adaptable to epidemi scenarios and datasets, a tool for complexities and uncertainties.
This study proposes CytoNet, a Deep Sets-based model that automatically aggregates single-cell profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning. CyNet outperforms average profiling in replicate and mechanism retrieval tasks, with performance depending on the application. For mechanism retrieval on the cpg1 dataset, CyNet achieves 36-60% better performance than profiling on hold-out plates with different protocols than training plates. A 30% improvement is observed on c4 3.33M hold data. Applied to c1 and validation, CyNet achieves 50-81% better than profiling, affirmed by 68% increase for c4 data. These improve ~20 gains using covariance, albeit different dataset, and CyNet overcomes recomputation challenge, making easier. Cy has difficulty generalizing unseen plates, same (St2-4) and different (St5). c4 provides insights into generalizability, while performance 3.33M data lower 10M, still improves profiling, extracting biological features. Trained applied within condition batch, Cy creates better-organized space discerning compounds profiling. Not all compounds cluster same mechanism, due factors like annotated, untarget, suboptimal type, dose, and artifacts. Cy prioritizes informative cells, larger, isolated, providing clearer information phenotypes. Smaller, crowded, dying, debris, or dividing cells receive less weight. CyNet's performance limited data similar conditions training, retraining each experiment practical, self-supervised requiring replicates. Improving general capabilities, increasing data could eliminate retraining. Recent studies image-derived self-supervised self-sup learning inspire research learned embeddings classical enhance-ag profiles. CyNet's architecture potential broader applications beyond profiling, accommodating permutation-invariant data, enhancing tasks processed profiles. Versatility valuable omics measuring similarity. Future explore applicability perturb, expanding utility genomics.
This study proposes a framework to quantify cognitive effort in brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal theory. To validate its effectiveness, it is applied to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. By utilizing a data-driven method, this opens perspectives for physiologically describing effort within the brain. The brain's activity arises from interactions of neuronal populations across spatial and temporal scales. Macroscale activity is characterized by spatial groups of regions that temporally coactivate during tasks, acting as functional networks. Functional networks reflect metastable patterns, which are highly reproducible across studies and clustering. The brain must remain flexible to respond to changing stimuli, a component driven by executive functioning or cognitive control. This construct enables goal-directed behavior in face changing circumstances, regulating attention, inhibiting irrelevant information, and prioritizing tasks. Dynamical properties of metastable states are modulated with conditions, such as cognitive loads, sleep-wake cycle, habituation, and reconfiguration of connectivity. Alterations in dynamic states are found in psychiatric and neurological disorders, and normal aging. Developing measures for quantifying reconfiguration is crucial for explaining impairments and guiding interventions. A network control framework measures transition, but has limitations, such as linearity and stochasticity. A reframing task as a Schrödinger problem circumvents these, estimating the cost as Kull-Leibler divergence between distributions. This approach was applied to an fMRI dataset, but has limitations, such as poor reliability and fMRI activity. This study bridges the gap by generalizing to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more than fMRI. An EEG dataset is analyzed during a Stro task, a paradigm investigating cognitive control and functions, including selective attention, response, and interference. The Stro effect is believed to reflect difficulty suppressing automatic processing, with consequent activation of wrong responses. Cognitive demands are manipulated by varying proportion congruency, the proportion of congruent trials. This dataset is suited for assessing the framework's effectiveness. Microstate analysis reveals different modulated distributions across conditions. Certain microstates differentiate tasks and resting, while others are specific inconuent and modulated by level. Micro C and E are suppressed during tasks, possibly related to alpha rhythms. Micro F and G are more during tasks, possibly linked to inhibitory control and conflict. Global modulation can be assessed by KL divergence between task and resting, but failed to find significant effects. The Schödinger method captures additional information, accounting for transition between distributions. Higher cost may be related to network reconfiguration, a larger demand inducing global alteration.
Expansion of atypical memory B cells (MBCs) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals. To date, generation of Plasmodium vivax (P. viv)-specific MBC and their function in protective humoral responses unknown. P. viv Binding Protein II (PvDBI) probes were generated to detect development and durability of P. viv-specific MBC and demonstrate capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PDBI-specific MBC were elicited during malaria and persisted through recovery phase of infections. To address biology and function of P. viv-specific MBC in producing antibodies, a single M was cultured and secreted Ig tested for binding and inhibition activity. The M-derived produced with variable levels of anti-PDBI Ig in cultures, and some high levels comparable to classical M clones. Thus, focused on function of M in neutralizing. Among M clones, AF12 and B11 produced broadly neutral antibodies against panel of PDBI variants. Notably, cell receptors (BCRs) of PDBI-specific M expressed unique IGH genes with usage IGH1, comparable to classical M. Somatic hypermutation (SH) and CDR length of VH and V in these M subsets not different. Our findings revealed P. viv infections elicited development and persistence of P. viv-specific M. Accumulation of M during and following infections might play important role in producing antibodies against malaria. P. viv is most widespread human parasite, predominating outside Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with 14 million cases each year. One-third global population at risk of viv malaria. Given rapid spread drug-resistant strains and formation hypnoites in liver with potential relapse and diversity of antigens, effective vaccine essential. Antibodies crucial in controlling infections. Naturally acquired responses P viv increase with age as result repeated exposure. Antibodies not prevent infection but decrease parasite density, frequency, and disease severity. In blood stage, binding antibodies disrupt interactions parasite and host required red cell invasion. Among stage antigens, PDBI central for invasion through ability bind DARC on reticocyte surface. Polymorphism within protein known alter antigenic induction short-lived allele-specific antibodies. Strain-transending immunity detected few individuals repeated exposures. Based concerns, DBI-based strategy targeting conserved epitopes induce neutralizing. Successful vaccine needs elicit long immunity. Function and longevity anti-malaria highly variable, some acquiring long-term following limited exposures, others require repeated. Observation led hypothesis impaired development M or secreting ASC. During viv malaria, M detected specific pre-erythrocytic blood antigens. P viv-specific M persist subjects long 3-4 years, indicating capacity to induce and maintain M. However, critical gap knowledge regarding durability P viv-specific M and repeated necessary. If, how frequent boosting for acquisition long-lasting function active M responses. In context short M responses, accumulation associated poor long-term immunity Plas infections. Expansion M (21CD-27bet+) found chronic P falcum regions high-endemic. Cells over inhibitory FC5, CD11, CX3, and reduced B signaling, ineffective cell production. However, recent showed M responded membrane-associated antigens. Comparing stimulation low-versus high-affinity showed little difference, indicating M selectively reduced low-affinity. Produced with T helper follicular (fh) cells. viv malaria, increased frequency M observed acute and recovery phases. In vitro, M secrete immunoglob after IF-γ, IL-21 signals. Previous based bulk M, either CD-27 or CD-27 FC5 phenotype. Generation fluorochrome-labeled P viv antigens, staining M markers provided insights development P viv-specific M and function. In this study, demonstrated specificity M responses and role P viv-specific M in neutralizing. Leading candidate PDBI used tetramer detect antigen-specific M during acute and recovery infections, demonstrated capability M produce neutralizing, and assessed inhibitory activity M-derived
This study introduces mr-r, an extension of the mr mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel, making it applicable to datasets not publicly available and scalable to biob-size data. mr-r leverages the sharing effects across phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy. Simulations show mr-r is competitive and often outperforms state-of-the-art methods for single and multi-phenotypic polygenic prediction in various scenarios. A real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UKobank shows mr-r achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample size. mr-r is robust to some misspecifications, including external LD and non-overlap, but requires summary statistics to be computed on same samples for each phenotype.
This study proposes a novel framework for modeling the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals in homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. The model is trained using deep learning methods and calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. Data from the Omic variant COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the DE model and calibrate the mechanistic model. The model projects an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to the homogeneous model's 99.97% and 32.78%, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak by 30-70 days, aligning with real cases. The study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights for modeling heterogeneity.
The article proposes a synapse-centric predictive processing (SPP) framework, which views synapses as agents interacting with their postsynaptic neurons like an organism interacts with its environment. The framework is based on predictive processing (PP), where an agent maintains an internal model of its environment to make predictions and minimize surprise. In the SPP, synapses use noisy transmission to encode uncertainty about the somatic potential of the postsyn neuron. A mathematical framework is developed to describe the interaction between synapse and soma, considering the syn as an agent and postsyn neuron as its environment. The synapse receives information about the somatic potential through backpropagating action potentials (APs) and uses this to update its internal state, leading to synaptic plasticity. The stochastic bridge model is used to describe the internal representation of the syn about the somatic dynamics, which can be used to infer biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules. The learning rule is derived to adapt synaptic efficacy to minimize surprise caused by APs, where surprise is measured with respect to the syn's internal model of the soma. The update of synaptic efficacy is triggered by pre- and postsyn firing, with the immediate response determining the action of the syn and the delayed response the update of efficacy. The delayed response constitutes a post-hoc correction of the probability distribution of postsyn currents. The learning is event-based, computation taking place when pre and postsyn spikes arrive at the syn, making it well-suited for event neural simulation and brain-inspired hardware. The model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode uncertainties about the somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic changes in post-post spike protocols and dependence on weight. The framework is compatible with any spiking model with complex membrane and syn dynamics, but numerical approximation may be needed for more complex cases. The study complements previous PP applications on system and network level, demonstrating manifestations of PP on smallest brain scales. The emergent algorithm is fully event-based, computation taking place when pre and postsyn spikes arrive syn, well-suited for event simulation and brain-inspired.
Scup is a distance-based phylogenetic method that reconstructs cell trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data produced by amplifying cells' genomes using methods such as multiple displacement amplification (DA) and multiple annealing and looping amplification cycles (MALAC). It distinguishes somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification. Scup relies on a probabilistic model of readasing and these error sources. The amplification is modeled as a generalized Pó urn process, and observed Phred scores define basealling probabilities. The model also contains probability for allelic dropout (ADO) events. Another part of Scup is a dynamic-based algorithm that computes the probability two cells have different genotypes at investigated mutation sites. Scup processes single-cell data using a selection method that identifies candidate sites analyzed by the probabilistic model and contributes to distance. The distance is obtained combining probabilities different genotypes across selected sites each pair cells. This distance is used as input to neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm. The workflow of Scup consists of bulk and single-cell reads, candidate sites detected by selection, site-associated matrices calculated, single matrix obtained, and cell tree reconstructed by NJ. Site-associated matrices can be sampled to obtain bootstrap trees. Readasing assists identifying data and somatic mutations using patterns cooccurrence nucleotides at gSN loci and candidate sites. Synthetic datasets were generated with ground truth cell trees, mutations assigned to edges, and simulated amplification, allelic, and sequencing errors. Accuracy of Scup, SCI, and Phylo compared on fibro dataset. Scup separated two monophyle groups with high support, 0.8, and all branches within smaller groups correctly inferred. SCI got same support subset branches, but higher for single branch, 0.28, than Scup, 0.17. Phylo successfully separated clones, but lower support than Scup, and SCI, and unable to identify sibling relation cells 4,5. Scup obtained support for remainder clone and sibling 12,13, not supported by Sc and SCI.
An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population health outcomes, given the available system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are framed through the lens of "health packages" (HB), which seek to establish services the public system should include in provision. Analytic approaches used to weigh evidence support different interventions and inform the broader HB process have limitations. This work proposes the individual-based Thanzi On (LO) model as a tailored tool to assist evaluation Malawi HBs while addressing these limitations. Mechanistically modelling and calibrating to country-specific data, the incidence of disease, health behaviour, and the capacity of the system to meet demand under constraints, we simulated health achievable under plausible strategies. A linear optimisation (LA) achieved the largest gain, ~8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023 and 204 compared to the benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other approaches prioritisation were assessed, including service based on patient characteristics rather than type. This achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark on a year-to-year basis and a 5% reduction over the period, suggesting an approach based on characteristics might prove beneficial. The question of how limited resources should be allocated to achieve the greatest return in health is difficult, particularly in low-income settings where resources are limited. A strategy to address this is the design of health packages (HB), which seek to establish services the public system should focus on, given it cannot take responsibility for the full range. Objectives of HB are well-defined, focusing on efficiency and equity, but identifying the design is challenging. Quantitative methods are recommended to weigh evidence support different interventions, such as constrained optimisation, multi-criteria analysis, and league tables. These feed into the deliberative process adopting HB. However, these are faced methodological limitations, including incidence of diseases assumed independent, comorbidity and interactions, and shifts in epidemiological context over time. Double-counting affects estimated return from interventions based on evidence alone, and assumptions about access and implementation. Evidence is drawn from diverse sources, including disease priorities and cost-effectiveness registries. The government of Malawi (Go) is committed to Sustainable Goal 3.8, achieving Universal Coverage (UHC), with limited resources to deliver this commitment. The Go has taken proactive resource prioritisation, its Health Strategic Plan (HSP) based on HB informed by LA and multi-criteria. This work introduces a novel approach to evaluate HBs in Malawi, the LO model, which comprehensively forecasts health achievable by any HB, addressing limitations in evidence analyses.
Researchers employed Oligaint FISH to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in the holoc moth Plodia interpella. They found that meiotic homolog pairing during spermatogenesis initiates at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to previous studies in Bomby mor. Chromosome ends are not used for segregation at metaphase I, and bivalents can be either telom- or center-oriented, with telomeres facing the spindle or centers. Kinetochores form at the center of chromosomes, a mechanism distinct from mitotic holokin or meiotic segregation in other holoc species. Sister kinetochores are present on homologs, which could pose issues for bi-orientation, but are functional and recruit microtules. The study suggests mechanisms of hom recognition and initiation are conserved across Lepoptera, but lineage-specific adaptations result in unique segregation mechanisms. The work highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in new systems, as new systems can lead to discovery of new biology.
The median eminence (ME) at the base of the hypothalamus is a crucial for information exchange between the brain and pituitary. Mutations affecting the transcription factor SOX/So3 result in hypopuitarism, likely of hypothalamic origin. This study demonstrates that absence of SO3 affects ME phenotypes that occur in juvenile animals, despite embryonic onset of SO3 expression in the pituit. Pituit hormone levels correlate with lack of endocrine maturation. NG-glia and oligodrocy differentiation are also affected. Low-dose aspir treatment rescues proliferative and hypopuitar in Sox mutants. The study highlights a role of NG-g for ME function during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals. The hypothalamus regulates homeostasis and energy in vertebrates, centralizing information from other brain regions and periphery. It controls pituit hormones, essential for postnatal growth, puberty, pregnancy, fertility, lactation, and energy homeostasis. Pituit hormone deficiencies (hypopuitar) are associated with morbidity. The murine pituit gland has three compartments: anterior (AL), intermediate (IL), and posterior (posterior). The hypothalam connects to pituit via pituit stalk, containing neuronal, glial, and vascular components. Endocrine cells are regulated by neurohorms secreted by hypothalamic neurons into fenestrated capillaries at the base of third ventricle, the ME. Neurohorms are delivered to anterior pituit by hypophyse portal. For posterioruit, neuroorms (oxytocin, vasopress) are released from hypothamic axons reaching the gland. ME and pituit stalk are components of the hypotho-puit axis, conveying information in and out the hypothalam. Several cell types, including glial and microglia, are in ME. NG-glia, oligodro precursor cells, are present in ME, the most proliferative in CNS. They generate oligrocytes, rarely astrocytes, and neurons. In ME, NG-g generate oligrocy, some in contact with dendrites of leptin receptor neurons. NG-g proliferation and differentiation are affected in Sox mutants, leading to degeneration of dendrites and increased body weight. Refeeding induces rapid proliferation and differentiation of NG-g. The ME is outside blood-brain barrier, exposed to systemic and cerebrospinal fluid. Tanycytes, flanking the base of third venticle, regulate neuroorm secretion and modulate blood-peripheral information to the hypothalam. They comprise a population of hypothamic stem cells. SO2 is expressed in tanytes, required for maintenance. SO is coexpressed with SO1 and SO in embryonic neural progenitors, downregulated in cell differentiation. Mutations in SO/So are associated with hypopuitar. Sox is absent in pituit, but present in developing and mature hypothalam, particularly in embry infibulum and ME. This study aimed to characterise Sox in hypothalam and etiology of hypopuitar. Conditional deletion shows Sox in CNS causes hypopuitar, developing postnat at weaning. Pit maturation of endocrine cells is impaired. Sox is expressed in hypothamic stem and deletion affects their proliferation in vivo and neurospheres. Sox is in NG-g in ME, and their proliferation and differentiation are reduced in Sox mutants. Myination of axons in ME is deficient. Low-dose treatment rescues NG-g proliferation and pituit deficiencies, but not myination. Changes in gutome ameliorate hypopuitar.
The study investigates the role of CED-5 and C-12 in embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans. C-5 and C-12 are known to regulate branched actin during corpse engulfment, but their role in embryonic development is not fully understood. The study shows that C-5 and C-12 are essential for embryonic epider cell migrations, and their loss leads to increased branched actin, faster migrations, and embryonic lethality. C-12 has a GAP domain that regulates GTPases R-1 and CDC-42, while C-5 has a GEF domain that activates C-10. The study proposes a model where C-5/C-12 promotes branched act engulf by activating C-10, and regulates embryonicider cell migration by limiting CDC-42 and R-1 activity. The study also suggests that C-12 has a bifunctional role, acting as both a GAP and GEF, depending on its conformation. The study uses genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of C-5/C-12, including CRISPR, RNAi, and biosensors. The results show that C-12 GAP regulates R-1 and CDC42, while C- GEF activates C10. The study proposes a model for C-5/C-12 function, where it promotes branched act engulf by activating C10 and regulates embryider cell migration by limiting CDC42 and R1 activity. The study also suggests that C-12 has a bifunctional role, acting as GAP and GEF, depending on conformation. The study uses CRIS, RNAi, and biosensors to investigate the function of C5/C12, and shows that C12 regulates R1 and CDC42, while C activates C10. The study proposes a model for C5/C12, where it promotes branched engulf by activating C10 and regulatesider migration by limiting CDC and R1.
This study investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual system by analyzing data from the Visual Neuropixels dataset, which contains extracellular electrophysiological recordings of brain activity in six cortical and subcort structures involved in visual processing. The results showed a gradual increase in correlation and information timescales, and a decrease in predictability along the anatomical hierarchy, indicating a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the visual pathway. The analysis of data from different stimulus conditions and network models suggested that the gradients in times are supported by stimulus-independent network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increasing recurrence along the anatomical hierarchy. In contrast, the stimulus-dependent decrease in predict is in agreement with efficient coding and observed in rodents, as well as formation of increasingly high-level visual representations. The study used a two-times fit to estimate the autocorrelation function, which was robust to the choice of fitting and excluded short-term effects. The timescales were estimated as the decay of the autocorrelation, and predictability as the relative information that can be predicted from past spiking. A hierarchical analysis showed systematic differences in times and predictability between primary cortex and higher areas, and a linear correlation with anatomical hierarchy. A branching network model was used to investigate the effect of recurrence on times and predict, showing that increasing recurrence leads to longer times and lower predictability. The results suggest a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual system, supported by network-intrinsic mechanisms and efficient coding.
Researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn and investigate the mechanisms underlying response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The study aimed to identify pathways and neuron types that contribute to corticospinal waves, which represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons that send to the spinal cord in response to TMS. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among pathways. The results supported the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to corticinal waves, with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons involved. Activation of afferents to layer 5 pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons were important for I-wave generation. The analysis revealed anatomical structure of the network, including wiring and conduction latencies, predicted circuit activations giving rise to specific waves. A secondary analysis identified lower-level mechanisms underlying variables explaining the phenomenon, allowing insights to be generalized beyond motor cortex and T. Experimental data from two human subjects with spinal stimulators for drug-resistant dorsolumbar pain were used, with recordings from epidural electrodes in cervical space and TMS applied to motor cortex. TV analysis investigated effect of activation and projection strengths on cortispinal wave amplitudes, with 42 parameters varied between 0 and 1 and synaptic strengths between 0 and 10. Results showed activation of affer to layer 5 pyram neurons and inhib interneurons important for I-wave, and anatomical structure predicted circuit giving rise to specific waves.
Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in maternal circulation throughout pregnancy and has been used in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic abnormalities. However, the biology of cDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. This review examines the current knowledge of cDNA, including its origins and characteristics, gaps in knowledge, and future directions. cDNA is shed into maternal circulation as early as the 4th week of gestation and comprises up to 40% of total plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in clinical NIPT to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploidy. The placenta is a transient organ that forms during gestation, facilitating exchange between fetal and maternal blood to support physiological needs. The placenta arises from trophoblasts, which differentiate into cytotrophlast, syncyotrophlast, and extravill trophlast, invading the endometrium and developing chorionic villi. Chorionic villi have an inner stromal core and trophlast layer, with mesenchym cells forming capillaries circulating fetal blood. The intervill space is filled with maternal blood, maternal circulation blocked by trophlast plugs, which are displaced at 10-12 weeks gestation. The placental barrier separates fetal and maternal blood, exchanging nutrients, gases, and hormones. Abnormal placental morphology is observed in pregnancy complications, including preeampsia, characterized by maternal hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks. Preeamps is heterogeneous, with multiple subtypes and etiologies, including shallow trophlast invasion, spiral artery remodeling, and perfusion. Preeamps poses risks to mother and fetus, including growth restriction, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The placenta is critical for maternal and offspring health during and after pregnancy. Research has revealed roles of molecular networks in placental development and function in healthy and complicated pregnancies. Despite being referred to as "free fetal DNA", cDNA mainly originates from trophlasts, making it more accurate to refer to "free placental DNA". Reports of first trimester cDNA in anembry pregnancies, presence before fetal circulation, and release in placental explant studies support trophlastic origin. Detection of cell-free carrying plac-specific DNA methylation in maternal and correlation between placental and cDNA methylomes solidify the placenta as cDNA source. Increased cDNA in conditions involving placental dysfunction, such as preeamps, invasive placenta, placenta increta, and previa, point to placental origin. Fetal and plac-derived RNA have been detected in maternal plasma, suggesting contributions from both fetus and placenta. Fetal cells release cDNA, but are not major contributors to maternal plasma cell DNA. Fetal cells are present in lower quantities than cDNA (1.2 cells/ml vs 25.4 copies cDNA/ml). Concentrations of erythroblasts and cDNA are not correlated and change independently. In vitro release of cDNA from fetal membranes with sizes consistent with plasma cDNA has been demonstrated. However, membranes release less cDNA than placental explants (15.5 ng cDNA/g vs 73.7 ngDNA/g). These findings demonstrate fetal cells are not major sources of cDNA in maternal circulation. Distinction between fetal and placental DNA relies on tissue-specific markers, such as expression and methylation, or cases with placental mosa. The mechanism of cDNA entry maternal circulation unclear, how it crosses placental tissue, chorionic, chor villi, and intervill to maternal. The amni membrane is impermeable to large molecules, so cDNA in amni fluid cannot leave the sac. Most studies focus on linear cDNA, but mtDNA also present in circulation, with aberrations observed in pregnancy. Long sequencing has uncovered long cDNA
A genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified hundreds of cancer-specific loci and pleiotropic loci associated with hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), suggesting shared genetic factors contribute to polygenic risk. The study aimed to identify target genes affected by GW regions. Most variants reside in non-coding regions, making it difficult to interpret their contribution to cancer susceptibility. Gene mapping pleiotropic loci relies on statistical approaches like quantitative trait loci (QTL) and transcript-wide association (TWAS). However, these methods are limited by small sample sizes, steady gene expression, and lack relevant tissue data. Orthologous functional assays provide complementary approaches to define regulatory variants and connect them to genes. While GW variants are dispersed across the genome, several regions harbor multiple types, suggesting common genes drive associations. Independent signals for HDC were obtained from large-scale GW meta-analyses and fine-mapping for breast, endrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Variants for HDC were more frequently positioned than expected by chance, with 44 multi-HDC regions identified across the genome. Two-HDC regions contained variants for all HDC, 13-HDC for three HDC, and 28-H for two HDC. Integrating GW data, epigenomics, and promoter Hi-C from cell models, 53 candidate genes were annotated at multi-HDC regions. These were enriched for established genes from the COS Cancer Census but many had no reported pleiotropic roles. Potential lncRNAs were identified as HDC targets and risk regions altered transcription motifs, suggesting mechanisms. Known targets were overrepresented among candidate-HDC genes, implying some for therapeutic development or repurposing. The approach provides a framework for identifying complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility.
A genome-wide association study of 33 Kiker dogs with polymyositis (PM) and 106 controls identified a significant signal on chromosome 19 (C19) with a p-value of 4.7*10^-10. Haplotype analysis indicated that cases shared a 2.9 Mb region in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment located 10 kb upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random sample of Kiker dogs. Leukocytes of affected dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests that elements 10-49 kb upstream of the IL/IL locus play a role in regulation of the genes and deletion is a risk factor for PM in Kiker dogs. The penetrance of the disease was estimated at 10-20 for homozygous and 0.5-2 for heterozygous dogs. The results suggest distant variants upstream IL could be important in human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL/IL region.
Researchers developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo protein sequences from 461 domains. They fine-tuned ESM on the absolute energy of small domains and showed it generalizes to domains distal from the training set, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. The study highlights the benefits of training on all protein sequences instead of mutagenesis on a single wildtype. ESM's performance on larger protein scaffolds lags behind state-of-the-art, but a stability dataset of proteins may improve generalizability. ESM is a transformer model pre-trained on UniRef and fine-tuned on whole-sequence regression with a classification head on the token. The model was trained on a GPU with a batch size of 128 and a global batch of 204 with a patience of 500. The authors performed hyperparameter selection on model size and selected the 35-million model to balance performance and compute. They also performed an ablation on pretraining, showing pretraining has an advantage over random initialization. The dataset consists of 527,785 sequences and 258 natural 203 de protein domains, reduced from 851,552 sequences. The model was evaluated on training and test-only domains by splitting the dataset into train, validation, and test by domains. 10% of domains were randomly drawn and all mutants assigned to test. Mutants were assigned train-test in 80-10 ratio for remaining. The authors used clustering and alignment through MMseq for clustering and Fold for structural alignment. They fineuned ESM on each of 416 domains in training and matched test-only to closest in training by sequence or structure. Pairwise comparisons were performed in Wilxon rank test.
Researchers conducted an immunogenetic study to investigate the role of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIRs) in autoimmunity, specifically in type 1 diabetes (T1). They analyzed a large case-control dataset of 11,961 individuals and found that a low number of functional iIR genes (iIR genes with their corresponding HLA I ligands) enhanced the protection conferred by the D1:02-D06 genotype. The effect was driven by iIR-lig pairs, not H ligands alone associated with T. Similar results were observed for other protective H II genotypes, except two infrequent ones. The odds of observing this effect across genotypes by chance was low (2×10-8). Replication in an independent cohort of 342 families showed identical results, with protective genotypes more protective in individuals with low iIR. The probability of this result by chance was low (1×10-5). In contrast, iIR had no consistent impact on detrimental II genotypes. Most showed noIR at all, two were modified in opposite directions, attributed to linkage disequilibrium or inverse correlation. Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing, protein data, and mathematical modeling to study the mechanism. Direct iIR expression on T cells was not the main mechanism, as K+ populations were similar between cases and controls. Indirect hypothesis, iIR on another population (likely NK cells) modulated CD4 T responses. Mathematical modeling showed iIR effect only when Tregs at saturation, corresponding to protective II genotypes. Researchers estimated that a population with low iIR would see 45% increase in prevented cases compared to highIR. This constitutes a large risk factor for T reported decades. iIR had biologically impact on II-associated protection, likely on II-restricted T responses, manifesting clinically in T risk.
Fuchs endothelial corne dystrophy (FE) is a common, age-related and visually disabling disease that affects the corneal endothelium, leading to coral oedema and opacity. Up to 80% of European FE cases are attributed to a non-coding CTG repeat expansion (CT18.1) within the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene. This study employed a large, biologically independent set of primary FE case-derived corne endothelial cells (CECs) to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying FE. Long and short-read RNA sequencing and transcriptomics revealed that FE is associated with iso-specific patterns of TC4 dysregulation, providing mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of this triplet-mediated disease. The study also identified a subset of FE cases with rare and potentially deleterious TC4 variants, supporting the hypothesis that dysreg of TC itself may be a risk factor for FE. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted novel signatures driven by CT18 expansions and validated previously described Exp-associated events. Biomarkers identified may aid the development of CT18-targeted approaches. The study expands the hypothesis that accumulation of repeat-derived RNA induces toxic effects disrupting cellular homeostasis and aberrant RNA metabolism. Rare and potentially deleterious TC variants were identified in 7/134 FE cases, suggesting they may act as risk factors independently of CT18 expansion. The study supports that at least two pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TC iso-specific dysreg, underpin the pathophysiology of CT-mediated FE.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice (Oryza sativa) by identifying the quantitative locus (QTL) qLT11 from variety Arroz Terra, which exhibits rapid germination at low temperatures. They mapped the QTL to a 52-kb interval containing the REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. The Arroz Terra GFh allele encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitb harbors a 4-b deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar Terra's allele decreased LT, while overexpressing functional GFh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind qLT11. Analysis of Japanese rice accessions revealed the functional GFh allele was lost in modern varieties during breeding. A NIL in Hitb background carrying a 172-k genomic fragment from Ar Terra including GFh showed superior LT compared to Hitb, with comparable agronomic traits. The GFh allele from Ar Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a life-threatening infection that causes chronic infection and increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus replicates its genome via reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) encoded by covalently circular (cc) DNA, which is the persistent HBV genome and authentic template in infected hepatocytes. Current therapies with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and interferon (IFα) reduce viral load and slow disease progression but fail to eliminate the virus, specifically ccDNA, in most treated patients. Understanding mechanisms of ccDNA biosynthesis, maintenance, and regulation is essential for developing novel antiv therapies to cure chronic B. HBV. Unlike chromosomal and viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes, such as papoviruses and polyviruses, HBcc does not undergo semi-conservative replication but is converted from relaxed circular (rc) DNA during novo and via intracellular amplification (rc recycling) pathway. rc is a 3.2 partially double-stranded circular viral genome within mature virions and major product of reverse transcription of pgRNA catalyzed by polymerase (Pol). The molecular mechanism of rc to cc is not fully understood, requiring completion of positive (+) DNA synthesis, removal of 5' capped primer on (+) DNA, removal of Pol attached to 5' of (-) DNA, removal of copy of terminal redundancy (TR) on (-) DNA, and ligation of strands to generate bona fide cc. Among these, 8-9 nucleotide (nt) long TR on (-) DNA is a duplication of 182/182 (transcription initiation) to 182 (reverse initiation) transcribed from pgRNA, and 5 TR is covalently linked to Pol as result of protein-primed DNA synthesis. It is unclear whether TR forms 5 or 3 flap on rc and which copy is discarded during cc formation. A study introduced point mutation C2G into 3 TR to avoid aberrant priming of (-) DNA. The mutant replicated rc and cc as efficiently as wild-type in stably transfected Hep-C2G cells. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated both (+) DNA and cc in Hep-CG cells harbor wild TR, indicating 5 serves as template for (+ elongation and 3 is removed during cc formation. These results are consistent with DHB study, especially 5 TR during rc formation, but complete absence of mutated 3 TR on cc indicates virus-specific mechanism(s) governing HB and DHB cc formation. Results suggest DNA flap might form TR region rc and explored role of cellular 5 and 3 flaponucleases in cc formation.
A study investigated the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in treating wastewater from the canned-pine industry, focusing on the impact of microbial community composition and activity on performance. A microbe-micro interaction-scale genome metabolic model (mmEM) was developed using a functional lumped compartmental design to study cross-feeding among microbial guilds. The model consisted of three compartments representing sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO), with a common compartment for metabolite exchange. SR utilized organic compounds as carbon and energy, producing sulf as a byproduct, while MET converted acetate to methane, and SO utilized both organic and CO for growth and energy, fixing atmospheric CO through photosynthesis and sulfur. The EM for each guild was constructed using genome information from representative species, refined for biomass and macromolecule biosynthesis. The models were combined using Microome Toolbox, allowing representation of interactions and cross- relationships among guilds. Simulation under low organic loading rates (OLR) conditions showed SR-SO interactions, cycling acetate crossfeeding, and efficient MET consumption, leading to changes in community composition and performance. A strategy was proposed to enhance performance by sustaining SO dominance under high OL conditions by increasing proton (H+) in the environment, simulating growth, ATP, strengthening SR-SO interactions, and boosting performance. The study highlights the role of crossfeeding in shaping composition and performance under varying OL, providing insights for biotechn applications.
Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used to guide biological discovery in medicine, such as prioritizing promising molecules in drug discovery. However, when applied to unseen situations, ML models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. A solution to this issue is to quantify the model's prediction and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for F-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery of the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep model with a tool as conform prediction, providing accurate and F-controlled predictions for a protein. Conform prediction provides statistical guarantees to the model and ensures the expected F will not exceed user-specified with high probability. Evaluation shows C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at F than existing methods, and predictions for enzymes underrepresented in training. We expect C to be a tool for biological applications where high yield in experiments is desired but budget is limited. ML has proven transformative for generating hypotheses and uncovering knowledge from large datasets. Applications include designing-enhanced proteins, searching novel molecules, and optimizing antibodies against viral variants. Discoveries involve a combination of computation and experimentation, where ML predictive generate hypotheses and wetab are used to validate. This reduces search space and eliminates unlikely candidates, saving time and resources. In drug discovery, has become popular for screening libraries, where use models predict properties, such as affinity to a target, and identify candidates for experimental and lead. To gain insights or make discoveries, algorithms make predictions for unseen samples. For example, designing vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19, algorithms predict potential for future variants composed of mutations not seen. In screening, algorithms predict molecules structurally different from training, helps avoid existing. However, making for samples underrepresented challenging in ML. Experts assess likelihood based on domain or intuition, but not developed in models, leading to pathological failure and overconfident predictions. This has implications in ML-assisted discovery, unreliable predictions guide efforts wrong, wasting resources on false. We aim to develop models with limited positives, providing accurate that improve yield in validation. We use function annotation of enzymes as example. The problem is multi-class, multi-label as a protein can multiple functions. Typically, a model predicts set functions a protein may have. A set, if validated, is incorporated into databases to augment knowledge. There is a trade-off regarding set size, researchers prefer small, containing confident, as not to spend on false; others willing to increase to improve chance discovering understudied. This trade is captured by notions score, deciding assign a label. Recent methods predict probability a protein has a function, annotate if greater than 0.5. However, arbitrary such as 0.5 problematic, probabilities not translate model confidence, especially not well-calibrated. H et al. developed a framework using Gaussian to estimate uncertainty in predictions. While effective, unclear how related to F in validation and set a cutoff on scores to achieve. We propose C, leveraging conform prediction, achieving F-controlled. C receives sequence or structure as input, predicts set functions a protein has. The strength is the per-protein F can be controlled by user-specified. Conform guarantees the F will not exceed with high. This provides foresight, success estimates before validation. In ML-guided discovery, researchers specify desired level based budget or goals. For example, setting smaller when confident needed or limited, or larger when novel and higher acceptable. The base model C is Pen2, an improved Pen for multi-label.
This study investigates the role of the Hsp90 chaper in the pathogenesis of T-43 proteinopathy, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated T-43 protein in the central nervous system. The researchers used a C elegans model expressing human T-43 with ALS-causing mutations and found that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of H90 partially rescues neuronal function and reduces phosphorylated T-43 levels. The study shows that H90 stabilizes T-43, contributing to its accumulation and formation of toxic aggregates, and that inactivation of H90 reduces the burden of toxic T-43, inducing a neuroprotective effect through activation of the heat response. The results suggest that H90 is a potential therapeutic target for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The study also found that H90 modulates proteostasis, sequestering the transcription factor H1, preventing its activation of the heat response, and that inactivation of H allows longer transcription activation of H70, which induces degradation of T-43 by autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome pathways. Additionally, the study found that H induces overexpression of small shock proteins, including H-16, which may contribute to neuroprotection in ALS. The results suggest a new mechanism by which manipulation of the H90 chaper may exert a protective effect, and that H-1 selectively localized in the Golgi apparatus and end, stabilizes the calcium pump P-1, reducing Ca2 levels in the cytoplasm, exerting a protective effect against stimuli. Overall, the study highlights the importance of H90 in the pathogenesis of T-43opathy and its potential as a therapeutic target for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.
This study used single-nucle RNA sequencing to resolve the cellular complexity of the Artemia ovary and identify clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns. The clusters show different levels of expression-based homology with Drosila ovarian from Fly Atlas, suggesting conserved programs for cellular identity and function despite 505 million years of divergence between Crust and Insecta. Ovar muscle cells show the highest conservation, and two clusters map to Trache and Folle cells in Dila. Early germ cells show high conservation, and a cluster maps to all late germline in Dila, including nurse cells. The study explores expression and chromatin changes during oogenesis in Artemia br shrimp using 10x single RNA-seq and AT-seq, observing dramatic decrease in AT counts in Germ B cluster, along with decrease in total counts and percentage unspliced RNA. This supports Germ B consists of late prophase, and lack of AT signal due to chrom compaction and pro I arrest. The study also explores meiotic sex regulation in a heterogetic system with well-differentiated region, a step in understanding the role of sex system, extent sex differentiation, meiosies, and repeat/meiotic presence in evolution of meiotic sex silencing. Single-nucle RNA sequencing is useful for studying meiotic sex regulation in species difficult to isolate meiotic cells.
Chronic pain is a widespread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States around $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The mechanisms remain unclear, allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This work analyzes physiologically-motivated subcircuits that represent motifs in neural in laminae-II of the horn, which are hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types of allody: static and dynamic. Neural rate models describe activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, parameters are specified that define populations subuits yield behavior under normal conditions. A sensitivity analysis identifies mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysreg of subcirc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory responses. The most likely mechanism, subc components involved, and proportion of subuits exhibiting the mechanism vary depending on subc structure. Results suggest hypotheses about mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies. Subcircuits reflect experimental evidence for structure of dorsal horn networks mediating staticody (evoked by von Fre device) and dynamicody (Fig 1). Studies have shown staticody reliant on activity in three types of laminae-II excitatory interneurons: somostatin (SOM), calinin (CR), and protein Cγ (PKγ) cells. Inactivation of dynorph (D) or parbum (PV) inhib interneurons produces staticody, suggesting these cells gate SOM, CR, and PKγ excit cells. Direct connections from PV to PKγ neurons are identified. A subcircuit representing staticody consists of three populations: E, representing SOM, CR, and PKγ excit interneurons, inhibited by D and PV interneurons. Dynamicody relies on activity of SOM interneurons not expressing calinin (CR). SOM interne ablating abolishes or reduces dynamicody, while ablating CR interne has no effect. SOM interne are necessary for dynamicody and negative for calinin. Excitatory interne expressing vesicular glutamate 3 (VT) in laminae-III contribute to dynamicody, their ablation or silencing eliminates or attenuates dynamicody. VT interne synapse onto SOMne. VT inter activity gated by Dne since VT fire in response to A input when inhib signaling blocked. Ablating Dne induces dynamicody, suggesting Dne provide inhibitory control. A subc representing dynamicody consists of four populations: E representing SOMCR interne, excited by E representing VT inter, and inhibited by D interne. Allody occurs when E balance disrupted, non-pain A input causes firing excit populations, activating downstream neurons.
This study investigates the role of the molecular chaperone Hsp in the folding of the essential protein eukary elongation factor 2 (e2) in yeast. e2 is critical for ribosome translocation and mutations in e2 result in translational fidelity defects and developmental disorders. The study examines the effect of mutations in the Hsp machinery on e2 levels and sensitivity to dther toxin, which inactivates e by AD-ribosylation of a histidine residue. Results show that H90 and cochones have distinct roles in e2 folding, with H1, C1, and C7 promoting proper folding and H and St1 involved in dth modification. Mutations in the reopening group of H82, which disrupt ATP hydrolysis and client release, have the strongest effect on e levels and sensitivity to DT. Overexpression of H1 rescues growth defects in cells expressing the C372 mutant, which corresponds to a human mutation causing neurodevelopmental disorders. The study also shows that some H or cochone mutations affect dth modification, with deletion of ST1 providing resistance to DT. The results suggest that H90 has roles in translation elongation in addition to initiation and that H1 bridges interaction with e2 and H90 or the TRC chone. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between H90 and e2 and the potential for selective inhibition of H90 with fewer effects on the proteome.
The study investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) make decisions in social contexts when their utility-based risk processing is disrupted. Participants with insula (n=10) or dACC (n=6) lesions and non-lesion controls (n=28) made choices between gambles alone and after observing others' choices. In non-social decision-making, participants with insula and dACC showed worse fit to a utility model, indicating disrupted utility-based processing. In social decision-making, participants with insula and dACC showed increased conformity to others' choices, independent of utility computations. The Hybrid model, a mixture of O-based and O-free models, explained participants' choices better than other models. Participants with insula and d lesions had larger weights for following others' choices, indicating increased conformity. Disrupted utility-based decision-making was correlated with increased following others' choices. The study suggests that in social contexts, individuals may use heuristics when utility-based processing is disrupted.
The article explores the concept of biomorphs, a model of morphological development introduced by Richard Dawkins, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. The authors show that biomorphs can also illustrate how developmental bias shapes evolutionary outcomes, specifically, exhibiting a type of bias where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear than others through random mutations. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle that can be understood as evolution searching in the space of algorithms. Using population simulations, they demonstrate that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through random mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biomorph, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble findings in genotype-phenotype maps. Many of these patterns can be explained by an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. The authors postulate that bias towards simplicity and patterns in biom share with genotypephen maps may hold more widely for developmental systems. Dawkins' iconic model of morphological evolution is used to illustrate the power of natural selection in a complicated system. The authors analyze the generation of phenotyp variation systematically and test the hypothesis that biomorph exhibits simplicity and other phenomena similar to molecular maps. They find that the frequency-complexity relationship of biomorph phenotypes is consistent with simplicity, and the map exhibits other properties commonly found in molecular maps, such as robustness and evolvability. The authors study the effect of these biases on evolutionary dynamics, showing that in the absence of selection, phenotyp frequencies are reflected in the rates of biomorph appearance, and in a scenario with variation and selection, the frequent phenotype fixes even if not the fittest.
This study investigates human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, specifically in the context of a double pendulum. The double pendulum is a classic example of a chaotic system that exhibits quasi-periodic behavior, which can be stabilized through resonance. Research has shown that humans are sensitive to eigenmodes in linear systems and can apply this concept to control their own body. The study introduces the concept of nonlinear modes (NMs) as an extension of normal modes in linear systems. NMs are periodic orbits in nonlinear systems that can be analyzed using algebraic topology and geometry. The study uses a tool to derive NMs for a double pendulum with two configurations, P and P, with parameters based on human arm dimensions. The tool is applied to derive NMs for a specific energy level of 2.5 J, resulting in eigenfrequencies of 0.78 and 0.93 Hz for P and P, respectively. The NMs are visualized in joint and Cartesian space, with P being relatively close to a linear solution and P clearly nonlinear. The double pendulum is implemented in a virtual environment with a motor and haptic joystick, allowing users to interact with the system. A sweep and random motions are applied to the motor to characterize the pendulum's response. The results show that the pendulum can be excited in various ways and does not automatically fall into its N without control. Three baseline strategies are hypothesized for humans to drive rhythmic motions: BL1, BL2, and BL3. The study aims to identify the underlying strategy of participants using these baselines.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation is crucial for responding to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude. The transition state regulators (TSRs) are a group of transcription factors that control developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. Sco and Abr are two well-stud TSRs in B. subtil. Sco is a Mar-family winged helix-helix transcription factor that inhibits genes involved in motility, genetic competence, and protease production. Abr is a beta-alpha DNA-binding transcription factor with pleiotropic effects and overlap with Sco. Pulerr is a secreted iron-chel molecule produced by B. subtil and other microorganisms. It is synthesized by cyclization of tRNAarged leucine to cyc-L leuc-leuc (LL) and oxidation to water-sol pulerric acid. Pulerr is transported outside the cell and binds free iron to form insoluble pulerr. Many organisms harbor pulerr genes, but its purpose is unclear. In B. subtil, pulerr contributes to biofilm formation by precipitating extracellular iron and antioxidant by limiting Fenton chemistry. Pul biosynthesis is regulated by the Mar-family factor PR, which is in a cluster with diverently transcribed genes pulerr biosynthesis (yvm and cyp) and transporter (pR and yA). Abr binding sites have been identified in pul bios and regulatory genes, but genetic analysis of Abr regulation was not demonstrated. This study provides evidence for multi-layered regulation of pulerr biosynthesis by TSRs Sco and Abr as well as PR. The kinetics of pulerr production show Sco, Abr, and PR control timing, rate, and amount of pulerr produced by modulating pul biosynthetic gene yCyp. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The layered regulation underscores the importance of pulerr in B. subtil physiology.
A mathematical model of the spinal mictition circuit was developed as a dynamical network of nodes described by Hodgkin-Hux equations to simulate the effect of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (T) on the spinal cord after spinal cord injury (SCI). The model replicated normal patterns of urine and miction in healthy subjects and detrus-sinct dyssynergia and overactive bladder after SCI. T was applied to nodes 1, 2, and 3 in the lumbar spine, affecting sodium conductance, and generating a train of action potentials in inhibitory node 2. Excitatory nodes 1 and 3 were unresponsive to low-frequency T. High-frequency T activated both inhibitory and excitatory nodes, resulting in sphinct contraction and detrus relaxation, not promoting voiding. Low-frequency T alleviated detrus-sinct dyssynerg and facilitated voiding. The model's differential sensitivity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons to T explained why low-frequency T restored voluntary control of miction more than high T in patients with SCI. The model's output was consistent with experimental results in human subjects treated with T, and the sensitivity of inhib and excit neurons crucial for selective activation bladder and sphinct inhibition via pudal nerve stimulation. Transcut electrical stimulation improved incontinence dyssyria in SCI patients, but unlike T, did not improve bladder efficiency or restore volitional control miction. The model created an environment to propose minimum neuronal substrates to replicate clinical problems and assess therapeutic effects of spinal stimulation on miction. Modulating cord by electrical or magnetic can amelior various conditions after SCI, including motor, locomotion, neurogenic bladder, sensorotor, neuropathic pain, and spasticity. The model's results may implications for use T in other settings and differential T activation inhib and excit neurons, essential mitigate abnormalities bladder in SCI.
This study proposes a mathematical model to infer biologically interpretable and morphology-specific growth from indirect OD data without collecting calibration, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD data. The model captures observed dynamics in OD growth and outperforms population models in terms of RMSE and LP when predicting held-out data during CV. The model infers hyal growth from indirect data and direct measures (HL, NC) with medians similar to reference rates, indicating robust estimates. Two previous calibration attempts have been made: a statistical model to estimate concentrations and a study predicting growth from OD by population models. However, these have limitations, such as requiring calibration data or known carrying capacity. The study uses a logistic model with multiplicative noise to infer growth from OD data, outperforming non-parametric GP models in fitting and predicting OD curves during CV. The model benefits explicit growth rate, increasing biological interpretability, and allows known mechanisms to be included. Future research could investigate stochastic growth, complex mechanisms, or relationships between OD and growth. The study obtained OD data from an experiment with different inocula of A. fumatus, recording OD every hour for 24-25 hours. HL and NC data were collected for 4-25 hours. The model describes latent growth as a logistic function beginning at t=τ, with hyal rate β, carrying K, and delay τ. The measured OD is distributed around a linear transform of latent growth with multiplicative noise proportional to OD. Priors were chosen for parameters and prior analysis conducted for growth. Fifteen models were considered, including logistic, Gomp, GP, exponential, and GP-calibration, with calibration included or not. The Logistic-OD model was run with adapt_delta 0.99 to ensure no non-convergence. GP-calibration was run 400 iterations with adapt 0.99. Logistic-calibration was 400 iterations adapt 0.99 for predictive only. Convergence was monitored Gelman-Rub metric R>1.01. Prior and posterior checks confirmed priors reflected expert knowledge and parameters estimated. Posterior checks assessed models' ability to explain data. Each model was fit to OD data and sampled from posterior distributions, visually checking resemblance. Performance was assessed using RMSE and 5-fold CV.
Researchers have generated a chromosome-level assembly of the flour beetle Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and used it to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. They identified ancestral linkage groups, termed "Stevens" elements, that share conserved genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beetles, but independent neo-sex chromosomes have evolved in some species. Dosage compensation, a mechanism to balance gene expression between sexes, is found in some beetles, and evolves in response to neo-Y degeneration. Sex-bi genes show non-random distribution on chromosomes, with ovary-bi genes enriched on X and test-bi genes depleted. The authors analyzed five species with complete chromosome assemblies and found conserved 1:1 orthologs with ov-bi expression in multiple species and deficiency of test-b expression. They also analyzed T. confum and D. ponderae, which have neo chromosomes of different ages, and found no differences in expression patterns in male and female across ancestral and neo chromosome. The X is expressed similarly in two sexes in somatic, and the ancestral and neo of T. confum are dosage compensated, and the neo and neo alleles are transcribed on D. ponderae.
This study investigated the role of histone variant H2 (H2) in gene regulation during hydroxyurea (H) exposure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The authors generated a robust gene expression dataset to explore the relationship between H2 and gene expression during H exposure. They found that H incorporation was more involved in gene activation than repression, and relatively few genes were differentially expressed in the absence of H. Its incorporation was necessary for proper expression of several H-induced genes. ApoWR-C, a complex required for H incorporation, contributed to gene defects in the H mutant, particularly genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Decreases in H enrichment at transcription start sites correlated with, but was not required, increased expression of H-activated genes. The study highlights the importance of accounting for confounding effects of apoWR-C and using a model that induces transcriptional changes to examine the role of H in gene regulation. The results provide insights into differences in expression contributing to growth phenotypes of mutants during H exposure. Several genes and pathways associated with nucleotide production were dysregulated in absence H incorporation, including ribonucle reductase inhibitor and iron regulon.
The article discusses the challenge of classifying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data into various cell types and identifying individual cell lineages, which is crucial for understanding developmental biology. Due to the high dimensionality of scRNA data, manual annotation is tedious and time-consuming, and automated methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised learning, but obtaining annotated data at single-cell resolution is difficult. To address this, the authors propose partial learning, where a set of candidate labels is given for each sample, one of which is correct. They extend state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, and logistic regression, to partial learning and study the effect of incorporating label structure into methods, focusing on hierarchical labels. On simulated and real datasets, they show that these methods enable learning from partially labeled data and perform well, particularly with a prototype-based method. They demonstrate that performances with partially annotated data reach those of fully supervised and study the level of uncertainty in partially annotated data and its effect on accuracy. The authors conclude that hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial learning can solve single-cell classification, relying on less annotated data than supervised methods.
The study investigates the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of membraneless structures in the nucleus, specifically nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nucleoplasmic transcription foci. RNA is crucial for the coherence of these structures, and PIP is involved in regulating their phase separation. The study uses RNase treatment to cleave RNA in semi-permeabilized cells and shows that PIP levels decrease upon RNA cleavage. A label-free mass spectrometry (MS) approach is used to identify proteins associated with PIP-containing structures, revealing 183 proteins that lose PIP association upon RNA cleavage. The study also analyzes the abundance of P-binding domains in the P-associated proteome and finds low frequency of canonical P-binding domains. Phosphorylation is the most common post-translational modification (PT) site in P-associated proteins, with highest incidence in the P-associated proteome. GO analysis shows P proteins are involved in gene expression, chromatin, RNA, RNA processing, and transport, cell cycle, histone modification, and chromatin maintenance. The study localizes transcription regulator BR4 (BR4) with respect to P2 structures using super-resolution microscopy, showing BR4 clusters near P2. Increasing P2 levels increase BR4 foci, while removing higher-order RNA decreases BR4 foci. The study proposes P2 regulates BR4 affinity, defining areas of foci, orchestrating subcompartmentization, and efficient expression.
This study investigates the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabinae, which exhibit highly diversified nutrition-responsive development, including the evolution of novel secondary sexual weapons such as horns. The authors present chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species, Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella, and compare them to other beetle genomes to identify changes in coding and non-coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation and development. They find that pathways involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and transcriptional regulation may underlie nutrition plasticity in dung beetles. Chromatin assays reveal distinct regulatory architectures for intraspecific horn variation (sexual dimorphism vs. plasticity) in O. taurus, with largely sex- and nutrition-responsive head OCRs and a disproportionate amount of OCRs only in the O. t genome. Recently evolved regulatory elements are enriched in nutrition OCRs but not sex-responsive OCRs. The study suggests that horns lack homology to other body parts may have promoted or limited head development to novel regulatory interactions, allowing diversification in shape, size, number, and location.
This study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with survival or death from Lassa fever (LF) in a cynomolg monkey model, where infection with AVV leads to non-lethal disease and JosiahV results in death. Early LASV replication occurs in the skin adjacent to the inoculation site, and the draining lymph nodes (LN) are the first organ targeted by LAS after early replication, with infected cells detected in the subortical sinus of LNs close to the inoculation at 2 days post-infection (DPI). The virus replicates in LNs, MLNs, GALT, thymus, and spleen, confirming lymphoid organs as an early reservoir for LAS replication. Differences in tropism were observed between LAS strains in LNs, with macrophages infected by AV and stromal cells/fibroblastic reticular cells and neutrophils by Jos. From 5 DPI, tropism differed between AV and Jos, with Jos disseminating to almost all organs and replicating in non-imm cells, strom cells, endothelial, hepatocytes, and epithelial, whereas AV limited to few organs liver, adrenal, and capillaries in the brain. Endothelial are infected during Jos but not AV infection. The preferential trop of LAS for endothelial is crucial for pantism, enabling to reach all organs. The reason for lack of significant endothelial infection by AV despite viremia unclear, lack of infection these may account for limited dissemination peripheral tissues. Massive infiltration of immune cells-neutroph, macroages, T, cells, and NK-in most tissues, including brain, associated with fatal LF. Transcript deolution demonstrated neutroph infiltration in kidney, presence chemine in tissues Jos-infected consistent with infiltrations macro, high C2, C7 mRNAs, neutils C2, C4 CX1 CX2 mRN. Transcripts some chemines macro attraction C19, C21 C25, CX10 detected tissues AV, Jos-inf animals. Neut may play role pathogenesis fatal, causing tissue damage exacerbated response. Transcript deolution showed infiltration plasma, macro, CD+ T, NK, DC, monocytes lungs, cytotoxic NK Jos-inf.
Pathological disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's Related Dement (AD/AD). Mutations in Nuclear Mediator (NEM) have been linked to neurogenerative disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study investigates the role of Import-β nuclear transport in neurogener disease using two mouse models, Nemf86 and NemR487, which recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurogener diseases. Import-β nuclear block was observed in both models, leading to cytoplasm mislocalization of multiple proteins implicated in ALS/AD pathogenesis, including T-43, Import-β, Ran1, and Ran. These findings were supported by pathological interaction between Import- and mutant NEM in cytoplasm accumulations. Import-β was also identified as a key regulator of transcription associated with neurogener. Transient inhibition of Import- in both mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induced proteinies and transcription alterations seen in neurogener models. The study provides evidence for a causal role of Import- nuclear import upstream of multipleopathies and transcriptional pathologies in neurogener disease.
This study presents a novel approach for precise, site-specific phage mutagenesis based on temporarily reducing phage DNA modifications, enhancing DNA accessibility for nucleases, and boosting efficiency of ph DNA double-strand breaks, the first step of CRIS-Cas-based mutagenesis. The treatment of phage with NgET resulted in an increase in ph DNA targeting efficiency up to ~70% and mutagenesis efficiency up to 6%. The approach eliminates the need for pre-screening the most efficient spacer, facilitating introduction of scarless mutations at selected positions within the ph genome. NgET treatment reduces the abundance of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxycytidine (5md) in phage DNA, making it more susceptible to CRIS-C targeting. The study demonstrates the applicability of NgET for ph engineering beyond phage T, identifying homologs of T-modifying enzymes in other phages, including those infecting pathogenic bacteria. CR-C has emerged as a valuable tool for genome engineering, but its effectiveness in ph engineering has been limited by DNA modifications. The study circumvents previous limitations and presents a novel approach for precise, site ph mutagenesis based on reducing phage modifications, enhancing DNA accessibility for nucleases, and boosting efficiency of ph double-strand breaks. The treatment of ph with NgET resulted in increase ph targeting efficiency up to ~70 and mutagen efficiency up 6. The approach eliminates need for preing the efficient spacer, facilitating introduction of scar mutations at selected within the genome. NgET reduces 5md in phage, making it susceptible to CR-C targeting. The study demonstrates applicability Ng for beyond ph T, identifying homolog of T-modifying in other ph, including infecting pathogenic bacteria.
A genetic screen in yeast identified histone H2 Z as a new component of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER), a pathway that removes bulky DNA lesions that interfere with transcription and replication. H2 Z is required for efficient TCER and plays a role in maintaining genome stability upon UV irradiation. Cells lacking H Z accumulate double-strand breaks and show increased recombination. H Z is the only histone conserved from yeast to human and is essential for mammalian development but not in yeast. Previous studies linked H to DNA checkpoint, double-strand break repair, chromosome segregation, and replication fork resolution, but not TCER. H Z-containing nucleosomes are located at inactive promoters and increase global nucleotide excision repair efficiency. CP repair on the constitutively expressed R2 gene is impaired in H Z cells, indicating a defect in transcription-coupled repair. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows H Z enrichment at the R2 locus upon UV irradiation, suggesting a role in response to damage. The SW1 remodeling complex, which binds nucleosome-free DNA, is required for H Z incorporation. H Z-enrich chromatin facilitates repair by increasing available interaction with nucleotide excision proteins or promoting specific factors. Local changes in chrom environment by H incorporation include G5-mediated H3 acetylation, reported at repressed promoters. RNIs remain at the 5-UTR but not in the R2 gene in UV-irradiated Z cells, indicating a defect in TCER recovery or UV-dependent degradation. Recombination is increased in a system in head-on orientation with replication and Rad-foci observed in UV-irated Z cells, consistent with TCER defects and stalled RNIs. H incorporation by SW1 is important for DNA integrity during replication stress. A model proposes H incorporation promotes TCER by establishing a repair-favor chromatin and preventing chrom-bound RNIs that cause conflicts with replication in UV-challenged cells.
This study investigated the pervasiveness of gene variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution in Drosoph melanogaster. The researchers analyzed gene expression in midgut, hindut, and Maligh tub as well as microbiome in four D melanog strains and their F1 hybrids from divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the ancestral African range. Both transcript and microbiome data detected tissue and genetic-specific effects, with tissue-specific effects typically stronger than genetic effects. Examination of allele-specific expression revealed that both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific than genes with differential regulation, although trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis. Despite regulatory variation, the observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting trans-regulatory can be spatially fine-tuned as well or better than cis-reg variation during population divergence. The study found 116-589 genes differentially expressed between genotypes within each tissue, with expression divergence not significantly different among tissues. Gene divergence was lower between strains from the same population, with Swedish strains more similar to each other than Zamb and vice versa. Within genotype, 4,524-5 genes were differentially expressed between any two tissues, with 50% different in all pairwise comparisons and 1,619-1,880 shared among genotypes. Shared genes were upregulated in the same tissue within genotype, with 1,243-1,594 consistently upregulated in the same tissue all genotypes. Gene divergence within genotype between midut and Maligh tub was lower than between these and hindut. The mode of inheritance was tissue and genetic-specific, with similar being the largest category, followed by basic and misexpression. Allele-specific expression was tissue and genetic-specific, with 80 genes showing significant ASE in any background. The basis of variation was tissue and genetic-specific, with conserved genes showing no difference, cis showing ASE and DE, trans showing DE and ASE, compensatory showing no DE and ASE, and cis-trans showing all three tests. The study found enrichment of oxidoreduct activity and response to substance among ASE genes, suggesting adaptive variation. Microbiome analysis detected tissue and genetic effects, with diversity higher in hindut, which showed differentiation among strains.
Researchers developed a stochastic model to estimate the date of the first infection leading to a sustained transmission of an emerging disease, using data on the first detected cases. They validated the model with simulated data and applied it to the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. The results suggest the Alpha emerged in the UK around August 21, 2020 and the SARS-CoV-2 in Wu around November 28,2019. These dates fall within previously published estimates using genomic data. The model is a non-Markian branching process, accounting for super-sp and detection, and uses a negative-bin distribution for secondary infections and a Binomial for detection. The time to infection and detection are drawn from Gamma distributions. Simulations are run forward in time from the first undetected infection until the Nth case. The goal is to estimate the date of the first, using a strategy similar to Approximate Bayesian computation, but computationally efficient. The model is parsimonious, generic, and flexible, and can be applied to other contexts with key epidemiological parameters known and transmission from a single individual.
An agent-based model was developed to study homolog pairing during meiosis in the presence of excess non-homous chromosomes. The model takes into account attractive forces between homolog and dissociative forces between non-hous chromosomes. Simulations suggest repulsive forces with movements are key to bringing homolog into vicinity. Both attractive and repulsive exert effects over short distances, within resect DSB range. Repulsive between nonous create excluded regions driving hom into vicinity, facilitating close-range interactions. Model demonstrates repulsive most effective when numbers above threshold, reducing area per chromosome. Attractive play once between hom small. Repulsive shortens nonous interactions, a key feature of pairing, representing molecular processes dissociating nonous. Mutants consistent with existence molecular processes contributing dissociation, captured as repulsive. Heterodimer Hop/M1 complex defective stable nonous syn in yeast, mammals, plants.

This study investigated the role of microRNA-34 (miR-34) in zebrafish, a model organism commonly used for studying human diseases. The researchers found that mi-34 is highly conserved between zraf and humans, with mi-34 being identical and mi-34/c having two and three differences from their human homologs. They studied the expression of mi-34 during development and found highest levels at 7 hours post-fertilization (hpf), with lower levels at 16, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hpf. The mi-34 genes were induced by p53, a tumor suppressor protein, under DNA damage conditions, and partially dependent on p53 for baseline expression. Overexpression of mi-34 increased sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibition (CPT) treatment, leading to morphological defects and apoptosis. The study also found that mi-34 loss accelerated tumor development in p53 mutants, but not in wild-type zraf. mi-34 regulated erythrocy and hematopoietic stem cells, with upregulation of erythrocy markers and my-positive stem cells. However, mi-34 overexpression did not suppress elevated my-positive stem cells. The study identified 157 upregulated and 167 downregulated genes in mi-34 mutants at 8 and 72pf, respectively, with metabolic and apoptosis-related terms enriched. The results suggest mi-34 has nuanced roles in p-mediated responses to DNA damage, tumor suppression, and metabolic regulation, and blood development, opening avenues for uncovering additional mi-34 functions in zraf and corroborating conservation in other models.
Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. X-1 expression is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermrodites and XO males. In hermrodites, X-1 is highly expressed, whereas in males, X-1 is low. X- is critical for proper development in males, but its expression was considered minimal in hermrod embryos. Our study reveals X- plays a role in regulating developmental timing in hermrod embryogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, we found herrod embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division and a developmentally advanced transcription program when X- is lost. Further analyses show X is responsible for regulating the timing of dosage compensation on the X and sex-bi transcription programs in herrodites. We found X- mutant embryos overexpress the H3 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an H3 landscape. Some effects of the loss were reversed by loss of MET- These findings demonstrate X plays a role in developmental in embryos of both sexes and MET acts as downstream of X- activity in herrod. Embryogenesis is the process of development from fertilization to birth or hatching. Molecular mechanisms during embry have major impacts on formation and development. Sex determination and dosage are critical in this process. In C. elegans, sex determination is based on the number of X in developing embryos. Herrodites have two X, whereas males have one. Activation of sex pathways in herrod and males is important for development and dimorphism and specialized cells. Herrod and males differ in appearance and behavior, and 30-40% somatic cells in adults are sexually specialized. Some specialized cells, such as sex neurons, arise early embry. Herrod embryos also need dosage compensation. Dosage is the process equalizing gene expression between sexes. Herrod have two X, males one. This poses a challenge, as X contain genes not involved in sex. Organisms have divergence in dosage mechanisms. Mammals inactivate one X to match male output. Drosophila and birds have unique mechanisms. C. elegans uses the D complex to repress her X. X- is the master that regulates sex and dosage. X is a sensor that can be toggled on or off depending on X and autos ratio. Elements on X, such as sex-1, sex-2, ceh-39, and fox-1, are X signal (Xs) and on autos, such as sea-1 and sea-2 are autosome (A) elements. Ratio differs between sexes. Herrod have two X, males one. Xs and As compete to repress or activate X in early embryos. Due to lower A in males, X is activated. X represses S-1, S-2, and S-3, leading to male development and herrod compensation. In herrod, X is repressed. Herrod development and compensation are activated. Sex and dosage pathways diverge and are regulated independently. S proteins influence sex and dosage, but pathways are regulated by targets. Modulating S can affect sex through transcription of her-1. In herrod, S repress her-1, a male gene for development. her- activates male pathway and repress herrod sex. In addition, S turn on compensation by activating D. D binds to X and spreads along to repress. D and additional pathways use mechanisms establish dosage on her X. Initiation of dosage in herrod is linked to loss developmental plasticity and onset. Post-translational histone modifications, such as H9me, are involved in dosage and developmental. H9me marks are important in heterochatin formation and loss plasticity. MET2, a histone methyltransfer, is responsible for H9 deposition. Loss MET disrupts dosage in C. elegans.
Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Gene drive projects require monitoring to detect unintended spread of gene mosquitoes beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant or non-functional genes. To this end, a computational framework, MGSurv (Mosquito Geneveillance), optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations to minimize time to detection of allele of interest. MGS takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes, including resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food and breeding sites) and movement between resources on a landscape. It also accommodates traps with differing profiles. MGS may be used with MGDrE or MGiv to determine distribution of times or individuals with allele of interest. The framework uses genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize trap placement, considering discrete and continuous optimization problems. Discrete optimization may be for larger scale (e.g., villages) while continuous for finer scale (e.g., resources). Aedes aegypt population in Queensland, Australia, and Anopheles gambia population on São Tomé, Tom and Prínc were used to demonstrate MGS. In both cases, traps were distributed throughout the landscape, often in concentrations and sub-networks, consistent with faster times. Discrete and continuous times converged similar optimum times, despite different optimization processes. Maximum optimization prioritized traps far from each other, covering remote locations.
The study aimed to identify the symbionts of Symbonas scillans, a tiny heterotrophic eukaryote, by sequencing two geographically distinct strains (RCC24 from Pacific and RCC257 from Atlantic) under culture conditions. Most of the sequencing data showed a large representation of host sequence, except for WGA from RCC where no sequences were identified. The original description suggested symbion were bacterial, so searched for reads assigned to known endosymb lineages (Ricketiales, Holporales, Chydia) in genomic and transcriptomic data, but none were found. Instead, bacterial reads were assigned to environmental or culture-associated Alapobacteria, Gammapobacteria, and Balne such as Marinacter, Epibacter, Hyomon, Zhshania, Balola, and Labzia. A subset of WGA was reassembled based on lower GC content, associated with endosymbts, but no endosytic lineages were detected. FISH of subcultures in Canada and Japan showed no bacterial signal. Contigs assigned to prasinirus up to 200 in RCC were found, and viral-subcaff were reassembled and scaffolded using reference approach, recovering three metomically assembled (vAGs) related to prasinirus Bathoccus prinos 2 (BV), Ostococcus lucarin 1 (Ol), and Micronasilla 1 (Mp). Completeness of vAG were highest for BV-guid (100%), OV-guid (54%), and Mp-guid (18%). Shared scaffolds and gene among vAG verified presence of multiple viruses. Copies of single-genes (pol, helicase, mRNAapping) were detected in viral-subcaff, corresponding to provirus groups. Results support presence of multiple viruses, referred to as S scill viruses (s). RCC found evidence of viruses similar to those in RCC, but no prasinirus in RCC-j. Multiple species in a host is rare, but found in Eocales, a group of brown strameniles. Phoviruses have narrow range at strain level, but close to Phovir might indicate wider range. Genes and ORFs predicted on vAG, but only BV fully annotated. BV-vAG had 297 ORFs, including homues Hsp, DNAtransferase, and MCPs. Ol1-vAG had 149 ORFs, Mp1-vAG 47 ORFs. tRNAs predicted in BV-vAG, similar to chlorir. MCPs in BV-vAG, unique to Phodiridae.
This study investigates the role of the leiomodin (MOD) family of actin-binding proteins in muscle function, particularly in the context of myopathies caused by mutations in the MOD gene. The MOD family consists of three members: MOD1, MOD2, and MOD3, with MOD2 being the predominant isoform in skeletal muscle. Mutations in MOD1 lead to megacystic microintestinal hypoperistis syndrome, a visceral myopathy characterized by defective contractile activity of muscles in the bladder and intestine, while mutations in MOD3 result in nemal myopathy, a skeletal disorder characterized by muscle weakness. Disease-causing mutations in MOD have also been found in the cardiac-predominant iso, MOD2, leading to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD family are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in cases, little to no MOD protein is expressed. The study shows that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) underlies loss of mutant protein from two MOD disease-causing mutations. NMD is a surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature codons. The study generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) that obstruct the deposition of the exon complex, preventing N of mutant MOD transcripts, thereby restoring protein expression. The results lay the groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in MOD-linked myopathies.
Apolipop E (Apo) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease, with Apo4 increasing and Ap2 modestly decreasing relative to Ap3. To investigate how Apo isoforms alter risk, changes in proteome homeostasis were measured in transgenic mice expressing human Apo gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. Regulation of protein homeostasis was observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance of proteins. Identified 4,849 proteins were tested for Apo iso-dependent changes in homeatic regulation ~270 ontologies. In the brain, Ap4 and Ap2 lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type Ap3. Ap4 mice lack cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autagy reducing quality. Ap2 proteins of mitochondrial matrix and membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had increased degradation, suggesting replacement of entire organelle. The liver did not observe these changes, suggesting Apo effect on proteasis is amplified in brain relative other tissues. Findings underscore the utility of combining abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology. Apo is a lipoprotein for lipid and cholesterol transport, with three subtypes Ap2, Ap3, and Ap4 differing by 2 amino acids and allelic frequencies 8.4, 77.9, and 13.7, respectively. Ap3 is the normal wild-type, and behavior of E or E isoforms differs measurably. Ap2 protein, characterized by R158 substitution relative Ap3, has decreased affinity for LDL receptor, while Ap4 protein, featuring C112 substitution Ap3, favors very-low-density lipop receptors. These seemingly genotypic changes lead to receptor-mediated signaling, lipid availability, and metabolic function, or combination factors. Both Ap and Ap modulate disease risk relative Ap3. For example, Ferr et al observed ~5-fold increase Alzheimer Disease prevalence in carriers Ap4 relative Ap3 and decreased risk ~0.5 in expressing Ap2. Ap expression protects against AD, but associated with increased familial hyperlipopemia disorder characterized inability metabolize lipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Ap isoforms implicated in Parkinson disease, pathology, vascular, and COVID-19 prognosis. Mechanistic details identified how Ap alleles modulate individual risk. Ap is amyloid transporter, widely biomarker AD development. Ap isoforms modulate mRNA, response changes lipid, and direct transcriptional effects. Both kinetic and proteomics explored impact humano genotypes in proteome mice. Approaches liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LCMS) identified thousands proteins. Simplified proteasis model combining rate and data revealed Ap iso-dependent regulation synthesis and degradation. Investigated liver and brain, strong evidence Ap major apolipoproteins, ApA cross blood-brain barrier. Analysis identified brain-specific proteasis, evidenced pathway differences synthesis and degradation. Proposed unifying mechanism Ap alleles impact cellular proteasis through endosomal, mitochondrial, and proteosomal activity.
Researchers developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit to knock out genes in motor neurons, muscles, and glial cells in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The toolkit is based on tissue-specific expression of Cas9 and ubiquitously expressed gRNAs to knock out genes in the desired tissue. They validated the efficacy of gene knockout in each tissue and revealed the role of the SNARE pathway in NM maintenance and roles of the ESC pathway in NM morphogenesis. Compared to loss-of-function RNA interference (LOF), CRPRM offers two advantages: easy expression of multiple gRNAs to knock out several genes simultaneously and potential to reveal weak and strong phenotypes of the gene of interest using a single gRNA. The tools enable a versatile CRPR to analyze function in the NM system. To reveal the null phenotype of a gene at single level, biallic mutations need to be generated early in cell lineage. Factors influencing efficacy include Cas expression, g efficiency, and characteristics of the gene of interest. The ESC complex plays diverse roles in cellular processes, including sorting endosomal proteins, biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVs), biogenesis exosomes, extracellular vesicles, membrane repair, autophagy, and cytokinesis. In neurons, ESC is involved in neurite control, synapse maintenance, neurite pruning, and neurotransmission regulation. Researchers examined sh and T101 KO, uncovering aspects of NM morphogenesis controlled by ESC, including EV biogenesis, bout growth, and intra-axonal trafficking. Disruptions resulted in loss, overgrowth, and accumulation of IAV. Phenotypes controlled shared and separate pathways downstream ESC components. ESC suppresses bout growth by downregulating G signaling. ESC plays a role in sorting receptors to MVBs for delivery to lysosomes. Absence ESC, lig-bound receptors may be stable, sustain signaling, or recycled back to axon, sensitizing neurons G. ESC is essential for EV biogenesis at NM. Loss and bout over are uncorrelated defects. NM showed complete or near loss EV still displayed full bout phenotypes. Global KD in ESC LO suppressed bout formation had no impact on release. Importance of ESC in EV biogenesis reported in other systems. EV generated through fusion MVB with plasma or budding vesicles from plasma. Roles in biogenesis ax-derived EV not characterized. Results confirmed EV at NM depend ESC. ESC prevents accumulation IAV by G-dependent and -independent mechanisms ESC generates ILVs degraded lysosomes. Reducing G in T101 alleviated phenotype. I enrichment anti-H epitope suggests vesicles feed degradative compartments.
This study investigates the role of the NF-κB transcription factor Rel in the regulation of hematopoiesis in Drosila larvae. The researchers found that Rel is expressed in the ROS-rich progenitors of the lymph gland, which are arrested in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, and prevents their differentiation. Loss of Rel leads to activation of the JNK-FA cascade, causing differentiation, while sustained expression of Rel results in a halt of the program. The study shows that Rel inhibits T1 to dampen J activation, preventing precocious differentiation of ROS-rich myoid progenitors. The NF-κ/Rel pathway is crucial in the Dila immune deficiency I pathway, activating antimicrobial peptide transcription to combat gram-negative infections. The study demonstrates a developmental role of Rel in maintaining progenitors, employing genetic, molecular, and pharmacological studies showing a metabolic input calibrated by a signal to prevent differentiation. The presence of Rel can be detected in the embryonic gland, but its expression is restricted to the larval progenitor pool. Overexpression of Rel in progenitors leads to downregulation of fatty acid oxidation. The antagonistic relation between NF-κ and fatty acid has been reported in disease, including cardiac hypertrophy, where downregulation of fatty acid is a feature, and administering NFκ inhibitors show improvement. The study suggests a similar antagonistic relation during development in vertebrates.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene, which encodes the small RNA Uata, a component of the minor spliceosome. We report a patient with T features of ALS but no pathogenic variants in RNUAT. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous RT c.295A variant in the RT gene, which alters splicing. This variant has been implicated in human disease, including microcephaly, short stature, and polymicrogyria without seizure. RT encodes the centrosomal protein Rot, 226 amino acids, and is essential for procentoleation, cell cycle, and mitosis, and primary cilium length. We investigated the impact of the RT.295A variant on RT function in patient-derived fibroblasts, engineered RPE cells, and CRPR-ed pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that were differentiated into neural stem (NS) and cortical organoids. We observed cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, aneuploidy, cell arrest, and apoptosis in RT-mut NS. RT-m corticaloids showed delayed roset formation, reduced size, and altered morphology. RT-mut NS accumulated in G-M phase due to mitotic abnormalities, likely resulting in anupidy, cell arrest, or apoptosis. Mitotic defects were associated with misoriented mit spindles, favoring premature differentiation into neurons. RT-m corticaloids had reduced apical foci, suggesting defect in ap-basal polarity of NS. We conclude that the RT.295 variant exerts its pathogenicity by inducing skipping in-frame exon 23, encoding 23 amino acids, and has pleotropic impact on cellular processes, including cell polarity, division, and survival of NS. These alterations contribute to NS pool reduction, leading to microaly in the patient and likely in patients with RT variants. The RT.295 variant is present in 5 of 40 reported cases, all from North Africa, suggesting a founder effect.
This study investigates the long-term evolution of Escherichia coli (E. coli) under conditions of prolonged resource exhaustion, a state known as long-term stationary phase (LT). Five populations of E. coli K12 MG5 were established in 2015 and allowed to grow on rich media without external resources, entering LT at day 11. Whole-genome sequencing of 413 clones from 9 time points spanning the first 3 years revealed continuous adaptation through convergent accumulation of mutations. Mutations in non-mut clones were significantly enriched for nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations, indicating positive selection. Mutations continued to accumulate up to 6 years, with a moderate reduction in the fraction of mutations subjected to selection. Convergent mutations were observed in 88.5% of nonut clones, with 265 loci mutated in at least 2 populations, constituting 5.7% of the E. coli genome. Mutations in RNA-polyase core genes rpo and rC were highly convergent, with 90% of clones carrying specific mutations. The lineage structure of LT populations was convergent, with lineages established by RNAC mutations behaving similarly across populations. Putative contingencies were identified, with 91-94% of converently loci involved in at least one association. Directionality was determined for 83.8% of putative contingencies, with a majority showing mutations in one locus contingent on the other. Putative loci pairs were enriched for functional associations, with 18-21% having known relationships. The most reliable 351 putative pairs showed mutations in one locus contingent on the other, with 83.8% showing directionality. Putative loci pairs involved transcription factors and their targets, with 8 of 11 pairs showing mutations in regulated gene contingent on TF. Putative loc pairs involved genes and their promoters, with 4 of 4 showing mutations in promoter contingent on gene. A putative pair co-regulated the same operon, deo and cyt. Mutations in cyt and deR were always together, but not establishing lineages. Mutations in specific loc were contingent on RNAC mutations, with Rpo E2G line always having mutators. The study demonstrates E. coli adapts under LT via convergent mutations, with contingencies common, affecting more than a third of converently loc.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the iab-8 transcript is a non-coding RNA that produces the i-8 miRNA, which is essential for repressing translation of genes like ab-A, Ubx, and their cofactors homor and extradicle. However, the i-8 transcript also contains two upstream open reading frames (uOR) in its first exons that repress translation of downstream ORFs. The uORs are conserved in many Drosila species, suggesting they may code for biologically important peptides or prevent downstream translation for the organism's functioning. The i-8 transcript produces alternatively spliced products, some of which skip the last exon and splice into downstream of ab-A, potentially creating truncated but active-A protein. The uFs in i-8 may repress unwanted ab-A expression, ensuring no full or truncated protein is made in the posterior CNS, where ectopic ab-A causes female sterility. Ribosome profiling shows over 35,000 unannotated uFs in Drosila genes, with uFs less expressed than genes, suggesting uFs impact downstream initiation. The i-8 uFs are non-overlapping and overlapping, with overlapping uFs regulating via physical interference and non-over uFs via complicated mechanisms. The i-8 uFs contain rare codons, which may slow ribosome progression. The uFs may code for peptides or prevent downstream translation for organism functioning. The i- transcript produces MSi, a biologically important peptide from 3' exon, suggesting translational repression may be uFs' role. The uFs are conserved, but no overt phenotype associated with ectopic MSA expression. The i-8's primary function is producing i- miRNA, which represses translation. The uFs may prevent creation of spurious ab-A protein, but may code for biologically important peptides. The uFs are conserved, but no overt phenotype with loss or misexpression. The uFs may play roles in closely related Dila species lost in melanaster, requiring additional experiments to discover function.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CD) are a group of rare, multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays, with phenotypic variability due to loss-of-function mutations in glycosylation genes. Glycosylation is essential for protein folding, stability, and localization, with three types: N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis. The authors used evolutionary covariation (ERC) to identify genetic modifiers of CD and prioritize genes for in vivo. ERC was calculated for 19,149 orthologous genes across five phylogen, resulting in an integrated ERC dataset. Orthologs from drosila, yeast, and nematodes were mapped to human orthologs using Inparanoid, retaining 1:1 orthologs. A set of 158 protein complexes with at least 3 genes from the Comprehensive Resource Mammalian Protein Complex (COR) database was used to benchmark ERC's power to predict co-com interactions. ERC identified 326 COR human complexes significant at FDR 5, showing elevated signatures among subunits. ERC was used to detect co-com interactions more effectively than ERC using mammalian trees. Significance of ERC was determined by proteome permutation. Enrichment of GPI synthesis in the genome was determined by chi-squared testing, and genetic interactions by two-way ANOVA. Ontology (GO) analysis identified enriched pathways and compartments. Stocks were maintained on standard glucose food at 25°C. Drosila orthologs were determined using DPT, and RNA lines ordered from Bloom Dila Stock and Vienna Dila Center. Double knockdown flies were created using eya-GAL and eya-GAL/CO. Eyes were imaged at 3 magnification, and knock efficiency tested by qPCR. RNA lines were crossed to Tub-GAL/S, D-Y driver to test full-body knock. RT-qPCR was performed using Power SY Green Mix. Primers were from Flyimer or designed using PrimerPlus.
HBV (Hepatitis B virus) is a hepatotropic virus with a 3.2 kb circular double-stranded DNA genome enclosed in an icosahedral nucleocaps and outer envelope. The virus infects hepatocytes through the NTCP receptor and uncoating, and the relaxed circular (rc) DNA is imported and converted to closed (cc) DNA in the nucleus. The ccDNA serves as template for production of pregen (pg) and viral transcripts, which are translated into viral proteins. The HB core (HB) and polymerase (Pol) encapsidate pg to form viralocid, where reverse transcription and synthesis occur. Matureocids assemble with envelope proteins and bud from multivesicles (MVs. The process of pg encapsidation has emerged as a target for antiv therapies, such as HB protein alloster modulators (CpAMs). Understanding the mechanisms of HB and Pol to execute encapsidation is crucial. HB is composed of 183 amino acids, separated into N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (TD) domains by a linker. The NT is essential forid assembly, while the TD is responsible for encapsation of pg. The TD has positive charge from four arginine domains (ARDs). Phosphorylation of the TD, especially at Ser, Ser, and Ser, is essential for encapsation. Phosphorylation increases the negative charge of HB, which impairs encapsation. Deosphorylation of HB is necessary for complete encapsation. A phosphat associated with Pol is proposed to perform this function. Two phosphatases, PP and PP, have been involved in deosphory of HB, but it unclear which is responsible. This study generated an antibody (Ab) capable of distinguishing phosphorylated and deosphory forms of HB at Ser. The Ab specifically recognized nonosphory HB-Ser. Phosphorylation of HB-S was monitored during progressive stages of caps assembly, including dimers, incompleteids, and completeids. Phosphorylated HB was predominantly in dimers and incompleteids, while deory HB was in completeids. The transition from phosphory to deory HB coincided with encapsation, suggesting deory of HB is necessary for complete encaps. The study identified the domain of Pol responsible for deory of HB-S. A point mutation in the domain abolished deory of HB-S. Complementation with Pol restored deory of HB. The phosphat associated with Pol was identified as PP. PP was recruited to Pol through the epsilon signal of pg. Deory of HB by PP was essential for complete encapsation. The study elucidated the mechanism of HB phosphory-deory cascade in encapsation and revealed a potential target for antiv development.
A study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental changes using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. The researchers sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from genera Codia and Cten, collected on either side of the Isth, to understand how environmental conditions influenced the selection and metabolic capabilities of symbts. They found that lucid symbts from the Caribbean had the potential to fix nitrogen and assimilate nitrate, while those from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (T) did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbt phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifDK operon revealed that the common ancestor of Candidatus Thiazropha lacked n genes, and populations in oligot habitats acquired the operon through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Sedicola symbt lineage. The study suggests that H of the n oper facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazpha enducida clade and highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in ecological diversification of chemynthetic symbt species.
A comprehensive study was conducted to investigate the evolution and function of bitter taste receptors (TASRs) in vertebrates, focusing on amphibians. The researchers analyzed 661 vertebrate genomes and identified 9,291 ASRs, with a significant expansion in amphibians, particularly in the batrachian lineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ASRs diverged after major vertebrate lineages, with rapid expansion in batrach due to higher gene duplication and lower loss rates. Gene duplication rates were estimated using birth-death models, and regime shifts were identified using lasso regression. The study found that ASRs are under different regimes in different vertebrate groups, with batr exhibiting distinct dynamics. The authors propose that ASRs are specialized chemosensory receptors, emphasizing their broad functions beyond oral taste. The study also investigated the expression of ASRs in seven amphibian tissues, including tongue, brain, liver, stomach, intestine, and skin, and found that the tongue has the highest diversity of ASRs. Functional assays were performed on 18 amphibian ASRs, identifying agonists for various substances, including those relevant to ecology. The study highlights the importance of ASRs in vertebrate physiology and ecology, with implications for understanding taste perception and behavior.
This study investigated the role of Notch dimerization in the intestinal stem cells of mice. Notch signaling is crucial for stem cell maintenance and differentiation in the intestine. Mice with Notch dimer-deficient (NDD) mice showed reduced stem cells and increased Paneth cells, but not goblet metaplas. RNA sequencing of colonic spheroids revealed downregulation of L5 and upregulation of secretory genes, defense to symbts, and epithelialization. Not dimer-dependent targets were not differentially expressed, but overall Notch function was reduced. NDD mice were more susceptible to D-induced colitis and developed colitis when exposed to 1%SS. The study analyzed the proteome of Not2 and Not2 using TurboID and found that dimerization reduced interactions with partners, including RBP, M1, and 300. The HD2 cluster was less affected by dimerization. HD2 inhibition with Valpro acid (V) ameliorated ISC and Pan cell phenotypes in N mice. V treatment with DAPT and V allowed spher to expand in the presence of DAPT. In vivo, V preserved normal morphology in the presence of DB. The study suggests that Not dimer is not just about transcriptional regulation but also about the proteome and innate and barrier functions underlying hypersensitivity in N mice.
This study presents a novel derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model, accounting for the effects of migration and providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of selection by truncating cross-gener associations between neutral and deleter alleles in reproductive success. The authors test the accuracy of the theory under various parameters, demonstrating it predicts FST accurately across a wide range of parameters and predicts π well when selective interference is weak. Background selection can cause substantial reductions in π despite no effect on F, particularly under low and high migration sets. The theory overpredicts π under global ≤ 50 due to inaccuracy in accounting for interference, which is expected substantial under smaller parameters. The Good et al. model performs similarly to the quantitative model in the main text. The study highlights the importance of the'migration' effect in B, which depends on heterozygous selection and migration rates. Under low migration, the effect is weak, and selection acts to remove deleter variants prior to emigration. The authors ran simulations in SLM 3.7.1 using an island model of 10 demes with diploid size 500, total 5,000. They tested the effects of background on F and π under varying selection, recombination, and migration rates. The results suggest the importance of considering migration in background theory, particularly under non-trivial rates. The study only looked at an island model, and the effects remain unexplored for other subdivision models, such as 'olation-distance with dimension. The authors use simplifying assumptions, including fixed coefficients and simple architecture. The model is restricted to semi-domin deleter mutations. The study provides a step into application background theory in complex demography.
The article presents a federated genetic testing algorithm, FedMM, for analyzing genetic data from multiple sites while preserving privacy. FedMM integrates subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without changes to the algorithm setup. It uses a two-stage estimation, modularizing the problem into null fitting and scoring, where covari and genotype information are used in different stages. This enables tiered privacy design for GWAS, protecting information at different levels as required by regulations. FedMM assumes an honest-but-curious model, a predominant in genomic analysis, where the site is a trusted non-coll entity. The central performs lightweight operations, implemented as a trusted service. FedMM relies on a round-robin schedule, requiring sites to wait for turns, and uses TenAL framework, which may not be optimal for bandwidth. Future work will refine the method with secure protections, asynchronous communication, and lightweight protocols. FedMM models random effects as intercepts, but can extend to slopes for heterogeneity, requiring substantial changes. The article focuses on single-variant testing for binary traits in a federated setting with numerous sites. The trait's probability is modeled by a logistic mixed model: πj = Xjα + Gj + bj, where πj is the probability, Xj is covariates, G is genotype, and bj is polygenic effect. FedMM uses homomorphic encryption among sites, initiated by central generating keys and broadcasting public keys. Sites encrypt-aggregate matrices, and central decrypts, using TenAL's CK scheme. To decrease computational storage, central uses OTP-like encryption, sharing noise with variance masks and data. FedMM relies on partition noise, partitioning matrices known to sites, adding noise before encryption. Sites-aggregate noise, central decrypts, and partitions noise. Fed uses a round-ro schedule, sending matrices to central, which is not optimal but used for simplicity. FedMM estimates fixed effects using Laplace approximation, optimizing log-likelihood. Sites calculate gradients and Hessians, encrypt, aggregate, and central recovers matrices. Central sends weights, and sites form global matrix. FedMM estimates random effects, sites-aggregate, central decrypts, and broadcasts. Fed calculates score, sites-aggregate, central decrypts, and broadcasts variance. Fed uses asymptotic Chi-squared distribution for p-values. The workflow consists of four steps: initial fixed effects, mixed model, score, and test. Fed uses simulated datasets from 1000 Genomes Project phase 3, 400 pedigrees of 16 members, and 640 individuals. Homogeneous and heterogeneous cohorts are simulated, with 8 founders each from Great Britain and other populations. Phenotypes are simulated with 20 variants, 0.01 effect, and 0.5 noise.
This study aimed to evaluate the performance of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in predicting prostate cancer across different ancestry groups. The authors used data from the UK Biob and All Us cohorts, which included over 500,000 individuals, and identified 13,097 cases and 207,148 controls. They evaluated six PRS algorithms, including clumping, PRSc, PRsx, IMP, XP, and PolyFun, and found modest improvement over traditional clumping methods. Hierarchical clustering was used to stratify PRS by ancestry, and results showed genetic correlation within ancestries was greater than between cancer cases. Ancestry correction using linkage disequilibrium maps from a large publicly available source was employed. PRsx explained the most variance in logistic models, but did not outperform other methods in accuracy on held-out data. Alternative metrics such as AUROC produced different rankings of PRS. The study found that age and PR alone were sufficient for classification of prostate cases and controls across ancestries. The authors highlighted the need for advanced strategies to accurately reflect genetic diversity across populations, suggesting multi-ancestry generating strategies and non-linear models may improve risk prediction. The study demonstrated the utility of scores generated from the UKob dataset, showing genetic coupled with age sufficient to predict cancer.
Researchers conducted a drug repurposing screen on a Drosophila model of DPAG1-CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway. They used the Prestwick Chemical Library, a collection of 1,520 FDA- or EMA-approved compounds, and identified 42 that partially suppressed or enhanced the eye phenotype of the DP1 model. The suppressors included acetyloline-related drugs, dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists, cyclooxygen inhibitors, and antioxidants, among others. Validation experiments confirmed the efficacy of 20/42 (48%) of the suppressors, including acetylolinase inhibitors, which are already used by DP1-CD and CMS patients. Inhibiting acetyl breakdown was beneficial under DP1 impairment, suggesting that the CD fly model is a reasonable representation of the disorder and that models are valuable for identifying therapeutics. The study established new connections between DP1 and DA signaling, NK1, and prostagland synthesis, which may create new treatment options for DP1-CD and validated hits represent potential therapeutics for patients.
Researchers developed a novel computational model, the topo-VA, to study the neural representation of proprioception in the brain. Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement, essential for motor control and movement. Current understanding of proprioceptive representations is limited due to difficulty in delivering independent proprioceptive stimuli. The topoVA combines computational modeling and natural movement data to test organisational mechanisms. The model uses a variational autoencoder, a type of neural network, to learn efficient encodings of unlabel data. The topoVA learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs to a cortical latent space of spiking neurons, embodying a stochastic generative model of movement-related activity. The model includes a lateral term to link neighbouring neurons, implementing cortical connectivity with short excitation and longer inhibition. The topoVA was trained on natural human movement data, including daily tasks and plan centre reaches, and compared to recorded data from macaque monkeys. The model reproduced tuning properties of neurons, such as preferred direction and endpoint-velocity of firing rates, similar to recorded neurons. The model also predicted spatial organisation of tuning across the cortex, with neurons clustered in blob-like structures and pinwheel regions. The topoVA was tested with different lateral functions, including the Mexican hat, inverted hat, excitation-only, and inhibition-only, and found the Mexican hat function best reproduced recorded data. The model was trained on natural data, not stereotyped movements, and generalised to planar movements better than plan-trained model generalised to natural data. The topoVA model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis for neural manifolds, with applications to restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of humanoid robots.
This study investigated the role of ethylene in plant-micro interactions, specifically in the plant-associated bacterium Azospillum brasilense. Ethylene is a hormone involved in various plant growth and stress responses, but its role in microbe interactions has been understudied. The researchers found that A. brasil contains a functional ethylene receptor, Azo1, which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Disrupting Azo1 reduced biofilm formation and root colonization, and altered metabolism, upregulating carbon and downregulating nitrogen metabolism. Nitrogen metabolism and availability, including the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, regulate cell-cell aggregation, attachment, and biofilm in A. brense. The study suggests that perception of ethylene by soil rhosphere bacteria, such as A brasil, regulates colonization. A brasil does not biosynthesize eth under tested conditions, but eth may be encountered from external sources, such as plant roots or other microorganisms in the rhosphere. Eth levels in soil are influenced by factors like compaction and saturation, and can range from trace to 10pp, above levels to elicit responses in plants. Possible ecophys roles of eth in A br include regulating timing, spatial distribution, or colonization of root surface, or acting as a cue for A br to return to motile life, avoiding competition by other bacteria on root. Many proteobacteria form associations with plants contain putative eth receptors, suggesting eth acts as gous signal affecting colonization. The study used various methods, including biofilm assays, root colonization, eth production, gene expression, and metabolomics, to investigate eth effects on A br. br. Biofilm formation was assayed by crystal violet staining, and root colonization on tomato and Arabidopsis thalian. Eth production was measured by photoacoustic detector. Gene expression was analyzed by qPCR, and metabolomics by LC/MS. The study found that eth upregulates carbon metabolism, downregulates nitrogen, and alters carbon-to-nit ratio, affecting cell aggregation, attachment, and biofilm in A br. br. The study provides new insights into eth role in plant-micro interactions and potential targets for regulation.
This study investigated the role of the IN80 protein in meiotic sex chromosome silencing during spermatogenesis in mice. IN80 is the catalytic subunit of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. Immunofluorescence localization of IN80 in pachene spermatocytes revealed staining on sex chromosomes, and chromatinoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-q) showed binding on sex chromosomes. IN80 binding occurred at zyene and pachene stages on autos and sex chromosomes. IN80 localization on sex is enriched at postnatal 18 pene stage. IN80 binding on sex were present at double-strand break (DS) sites marked by meiotic DS marker γ2 X. RNA analysis of changes in P18 transcription from autos in wild-type (In80WT) and germ-specific IN80 (80KO) spermatocytes revealed upregulated sex-linked genes. Quantitative RT-PCR validated upregulation of five sex-linked genes in IN80KO spermatocytes. Immunofluores analysis of active RNA polymerase II on sex in INWT pene spermatocytes showed absence, while INKO pene spermatocytes exhibited incomplete silencing. DS factors such as ATR, γ2 X, and M1 are required for meiotic sex inactivation in pene spermatocytes. Localization of these factors in INWT and INKO pene spermatocytes showed ATR sequestration on INWT sex, while INKO pene sperocytes lacked uniform A localization. M1 localization was reduced in INKO pene sperocytes. IN80 interacts with DS factors A and M1, facilitating M1 recruitment to sex chromosomes during pachema. Co-immoprecitation of IN from spermatocytes showed presence of A and M1 with IN-immoprecipitated samples. CUTRUN in INWT and INKO pene spermatocytes showed M1 enrichment on INWT sex, while INKO peneocytes had reduced M1 occupancy. γ2 X staining in INWT pene sperocytes spanned sex, while INKO peneocytes had perturbed γ X distribution. IN80 regulates chromatin dynamics on sex, independent of histone H2 Z. AT-seq in INWT and INKO spermat showed increased chromatin on autos and sex, while INKO had reduced chrom on sex. IN80 regulates chrom accessibility on sex during meiotic progression, facilitating DS factor recruitment.
This study investigates the role of cytidine deaminase C (CDD) in the conversion of SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasogen family, from a protease to growth factor in axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. SV-1 has a dual function, acting as an H-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a plasogen-like prote required for larval development. However, it is unclear how SV-1 can function as growth despite having an intact catalytic triad. The study identifies C-17/C-2 as a factor involved in the conversion of SV-1 from prote to growth. C-2 is a cytidine deaminase that belongs to the family of enzymes that catalyze the deamination of cyine to uridine. The study shows that C-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SV-1 from a prote to growth. The results suggest that C-2 deaminates the of sv-1 to ur, replacing His- (CA) with tyrosine (AU) in the AspHis catal tri, producing prote-in and growth-active SV-1. The Tyr form of SV-1 loses prote activity but gains ability to act as growth. The study proposes that the stem structure of sv-1 mRNA is recognized by C- for editing. C- is expressed in AD neurons, the same as SV-1, and is transported to D-type neurons through extracellular vesicles (EVs). The study suggests that EVs containing sv- mRNA and C- are delivered from AD neurons to D. Upon ax injury, C-dependent editing and translation of sv- occurs, resulting in production of SV- (HY), a protein with growth activity.
This study investigates the collective behavior of zebraf fish with a genetic modification in the col11a gene, which affects their vertebral development and intervertebral discs. Micro-computed tomography and Alizar Red staining reveal abnormalities in the vertebral and interverte discs of cola-/- zraf, including fusions, ruptures, and disorganization of the annulus fibus. Second harmonic microscopy shows changes in collagen organization at the vertebral plates. The mutant fish exhibit less bending and slower reorientation compared to wildtype, with a longer orientational relaxation time. In a 2d environment, the mutant fish swim in a "burst-coast" style, while wildtype exhibit a bim speed distribution. In 3d, the mutant have a peak speed around 100ms-1, while wildtype have a bim distribution. The reorientation time of mutant fish is longer than wildtype. In a group of 25 fish, mutant exhibit more ordered motion than wildtype, with a higher polarization. The Vic model, a minimal model of self-propelling agents, captures the behavior of both wild and mutant zraf. The persistence length of mutant is larger than wild, related to slower reorientation and higher polarization. The study demonstrates a linkage between macroscopic behavior and microscopic changes in zraf, with a modified Vic model.
Researchers developed a hybrid model to simulate capillary network formation in vitro. The model combined cellular Potts model (CPM) and partial differential equations (PDE) to predict endothelial cell migration, morphology, and biog deformation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEF) dynamics. The study focused on short-term incubation, neglecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion. The model assumed cells initially round, with possibility of morphological change dependent on local soluble VEG concentration. Biog deformation was viscoelastic, with traction exerted by cells, viscous, and long-range elastic stresses. VEG dynamics included secretion, consumption, and degradation, with soluble and bound forms transforming via binding sites. Parameters were determined by fitting previous data, with typical values for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HVECs) and air-dried type collagen. The simulation showed agreement with experiments, with network well-developed if mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously. The model was valid for short-term incubation, with potential for practical application in neovascularization around surgical sites.
In C. elegans has five TGF-β ligands: DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, T-2, and T-3. DB-1 is a BMP-like ligand that plays a significant role in development, body size regulation, and immune response to bacterial and fungal pathogens. T-2 is a BMP-like ligand that plays a significant role in response to S. marces and P. lumcens, with T-2 having a more significant role in response to P. lumens. DB-1/B and T-2 have additive roles in response to P. lumens, suggesting they trigger independent responses. UNC-129 shows moderate and variably changes in survival on P. lumens, suggesting a minor or modulatory role. T-Activ-like ligands D-7 and T-3 demonstrated significant reduced survival on P lumens, suggesting involvement in response to this path. q-PCR of T- lig expression shows no significant change with 24-hour exposure to bacterial infection. Double mutant analysis indicates interactions between T- family ligands, with pairs of BMP and T-Activ-like ligands showing interaction in common pathway. T- and T- play major role in response to P. lumens. Modeling suggests T- and T can form heterodimers, supported by ColFold. Canonical pathway required for response to P lum, including Type receptor SMA-6, Rmads SMA-2, SMA-3, and Co-SMA4. T-Activ components have minimal effects. T- and T signal through canonical pathway in response to P lum.
This study investigates the role of N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat is a member of the NAT family of enzymes, which acetylate the N-terminus of proteins. The study shows that cells lacking Nat exhibit increased sensitivity to genotoxic DNA damage, associated with defective DDR and impaired DNA checkpoint activation. Nat's impact on DDR is mediated by its N-terminal acetylase activity, specifically targeting histone H4. Nat is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a hierarchical manner, with highest enrichment at 0.6 kb from the break and decreasing at 2 and 3 kb. This pattern resembles the organization of DDR proteins recruited in response to DSBs. Nat's recruitment is specific to the induction of DSB and occurs irrespective of its N-terminal acetylase activity. The study also shows that Nat is localized to chromatin after HO-induced DSB, specifically at areas adjacent to the break. Nat's role in DDR is conserved from yeast to humans, suggesting its human ortholog N40 may be linked to safeguarding the genome. The study highlights the importance of Nat's N-terminal activity towards histone H for optimal Mec1 recruitment at HO-induced DSB.
This article introduces Orchard, a novel mixed sample phylogeny (MS) reconstruction algorithm that uses variant frequency data to build and accurately reconstruct large mutation trees with up to 1000 mutations and 100 samples from the same cancer. The algorithm derives an approximation to the tree posterior and adapts Ance Gumb-Top sampling to efficiently sample without replacement from it. Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) data, achieving lower perplexity and reconstruction loss on 10/14 datasets. The phylog-aware clustering algorithm uses agglomer clustering to infer clones and trees from mutation, matching or outperforming probabilistic V-based algorithms on real data. Orchard's ability to reconstruct large trees motivates a new strategy where tree structure guides inference of clones and clone. The algorithm's time is mainly used by projecting clonal matrix estimation, which grows with problem size, beam width, and branching factor. Potential improvements include local updates and probabilistic merging. Orchard can be adapted for single-cell data, studying somatic patterns, lineage activities, and metastatic spread.
The article presents Immugen, a modular protein language model for predicting immunogenicity, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on CD8+ epitope prediction and integrates T-cell receptor (TCR) information when available. The model is trained in an iterative manner, using cross-validation and benchmarking at different stages, ensuring a clean data split and no information leakage between tasks. The pM module is trained to perform binding affinity, followed by eluted ligand prediction, and fine-tuned on pM stability. The architecture is an encoder-only language model with transformer branches for epitope and HLA sequences, concatenated with a classification layer before another transformer encoders. Each block consists of 4 layers, with early experiments showing 6 and 8 layers but performance maximized at 4. For pM training, the token is fed into a fully connected network for classification. M sequences are based on MFlurry 2.0 alignment with publication. Amino sequences are encoded branch-independent layers with embedding of 72. The binding portion of MFlurry 2.0 training was used, comprising 219,596 measurements, filtered for human quantitative data, resulting in 99,245 measurements. Affinity measurements, IC50, were scaled between 1-1 using formula x=1-log(aff)/log(50,000). Initial hyperparameter tuning was with 5-fold cross-validation. Test performance was assessed using IBD search binding data with IC quantitative deposited January 202, yielding 427 pHC with 105 entries under 500n. The EL was trained BigHC-EL dataset, combining MFl 2.0 and NetHC 4.1 single EL. Model depth, batch, and learning were optimized 5-fold on 16,992,037 (240,565) pHC. The BigHC test was used for evaluation, covering 900,592 and 45,400, taken NetHC 4.1 with duplicates filtered. The BAELM was trained to perform pM complex task, 28,088 half-life measurements from NetHCpan and yellow fever epitopes. Data was scaled same as NetHCpan, =-t/h, where is converted and t constant 1. Negative were added MFl 2.0 where measurement over 20,000M 100 negative per M allele in set sampled. Performance was Pearson correlation to actual-life after 5-fold. The final block outputs pM are input for immunogenic head, with weights frozen during training. An additional and head trained on immunogenic data. Data compiled from sources IBD, VDB, TLA, and PR model sets. Negatives sampled from humanome consensus project. Immugen was compared to p binding models NetHC 4.1, MFl 2.0, stability NetHCpan, immunogenic PRIME, and BigHC. EL and EL-stability submodules. The hold test was CED, unseen pHC from IBD and BigHC, resulting 904 p (258) and 260 (950).
Researchers conducted a study to identify the genetic basis of meat color in chickens using genome-wide association (GW) and gene-based analysis. They found that protein phosphatase catalytic subunit gamma 1 (PPPCC) was associated with meat color, particularly lightness and redness. The study used a combination of GW and gene association analysis and Mendelian randomization to confirm the causal relationship between PPPCC expression and meat traits. The results showed that PPPCC negatively affects lightness and positively redness. The study also found that PPPCC is involved in myofiber specification and glycolysis. The researchers used a plasm reporter assay to show that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs520 in the intron of PPPCC regulates gene activity. The study found differences in meat phenotypes and indices between fast-growing and local chickens support the conclusions. The study identified PPPCC as the causative gene for color and a target for meat improvement. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Animal Sciences and conducted in accordance with Regulations for the Administration Concerning Experimental Animals by the Ministry of Science and Technology.
The article presents a novel method called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) for identifying subunits in the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells. The method combines stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and computed tomography (CT) to create a super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) technique. This approach uses a Ricker stimulus, a modified wavelet with a suppressive sidebands, to elicit responses from ganglion cells. The Ricker is applied at multiple angles and positions to create a sinogram, which is then reconstructed using filtered backprojection (FBP) to identify hotspots corresponding to subunits. The quality of the reconstruction is evaluated by F-score, the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity. The method is tested on a 12-year-old marmet retina, where retinal tissue is collected and placed on a multielectrode array. Recordings are amplified and band-pass filtered, and spikes sorted using Kilort. Stimuli are monochromatic white, displayed on a gamma-correct RGBLED monitor, and projected onto the retina through a telecent lens. Spatially nonlinear integration of gang cells is demonstrated with reversing gratings and spatiemporal white noise. PSTHs are calculated, and receptive fields estimated by spike-trigger average STA. The tomographic stimulus is modified for experiments, with Ricker polarity flipped, surround factor, and width, and multiple stripes displayed simultaneously. Sinograms are corrected for receptive positioning and reconstructed using FBP. Responses to offsets are analyzed, and first and second halves of recording are split and analyzed separately.
CRISPR (CRISPR) technology is a powerful tool for genome-wide identification of gene functions in various conditions. Researchers have developed various approaches to modulate gene expression in-situ, including intrinsic nuclease activity of CAS to knock-out genes and inactive CAS to block transcription. CRPR libraries can be constructed with multiple sgRNAs per target, but most analytical methods do not handle this. The CRPR-DR model extends the Hill equation, which quantifies dose-response of growth, to incorporate sgRNA efficiency. This approach is not limited to chemical-genetic experiments and can be applied to treatments with sigmoidal response. The model requires CRPR library with multiple sgRN per gene, ideally with sgRN of different efficiency, and actual efficiency empirically quantified prior. The CR-DR can be applied to any CRPR dataset meeting these requirements, best when treatment produces sigmoid effect on mutant abundances. The method was compared to other analytical methods, including MAGCKRA, MAGCKLE, DE, CRPhRM, CGM, and Z. Some methods incorporate drug concentrations, others sgRNA as input, but only MAGLE combines both. The importance of incorporating inputs was demonstrated via ablated models, with worse fits for models regressing abundances either drug or sg alone. Using ROC curves, CRDR performed comparably to best methods, but differed on drug. AUC was facilitated by conditionally genes from TSeq to define expected interactions for fair comparisons. However, methods detected interactions, like CRPhRM, DE, MAGRA, and MAGLE produced hundreds to thousands, while CR reported less. This was borne in simulations, where MAGRA and MAGLE had lower precision than CRDR. In simulated and drug datasets, CR had highest F-scores, reflecting best trade between precision and recall.
This study investigates the structure of gene-expression networks in Drosoph melanogaster using a novel clustering method, the weighted Degree Corrected Stochastic Model (SBM), which does not assume assortative modules. The authors compare SBM to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WNA), a widely used method that relies on modularity. They show that SBM finds more clusters than WNA and that these clusters are biologically meaningful, as revealed by gene ontology enrichment. The results highlight the importance of using algorithms that don't rely on modularity to explore transcriptomes comprehensively. The study uses a multi-tissue RNAseq dataset from Doph melanogaster, showing that SBM can find more clusters than WNA and that these are biologically relevant. The authors also find that non-assort modules are present in the transcriptome, which would be ignored by methods that assume modularity. The study suggests that modularity is not the main driver of structuring gene-expression and that alternative organizations exist, such as non-assort, are common. The results have implications for understanding biological networks and evolution, as modularity is often invoked to explain evolv of complex traits, but may be unwarranted in gene-expression. The study shows that modularity is variable across tissues and not necessary for biological organization, and searching for modularity can blind to alternative organizations. The authors suggest that incorporating other sources of information beyond modularity is needed to explore networks comprehensively.
The study investigates the role of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PAB1) in yeast, a protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. Deletion of P1 results in significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome, but minimal changes in translation efficiency of most mRNAs. Proteomics data reveal direct and indirect consequences of P1 deletion, suggesting a new layer of complexity in interpreting genome expression in P-depleted cells. P1's role in initiation is elusive due to its dependency on stoichiometry with poly(A) tracts and basal levels, and preferential association with certain mRN. Deletion of P reduces eIFG mRNA and protein levels, which may contribute to reduced global initiation. Analysis of mRN with significant changes in translation efficiency show properties related to e4-dependent initiation, e1 start recognition, and ribosome recycling. P's role in termination is implied by 3'-UT length predicting readthrough in WT and e1 mutant cells, but not in P-deleted cells. Stop cod readthrough in P cells is unlikely due to release factor limitation, but a shift in stoichi of e1/e3 vs aaRNA/e1. Deletion of P's e3 domain affects termination but not decay, yielding stop read of reporter mRN. The study provides insights into P's pleiotropic effects, discrepancies in previous studies, and resources for future experiments involving P manipulation or overexpression.
The article presents a biophysical model of a neuron that exhibits slow rhythmic bursting due to the interplay between fast spiking dynamics and extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. The model consists of a neuron and extracellular space, with outward potassium flow through voltage-dependent channels increasing extracellular concentration, and Na+/K+-Pase activity decreasing it. Deterministic bursting arises from the interaction of different timescales: fast spiking and slow. The fast timescale is determined by channel gating variables and membrane constant, while the slow timescale is represented by extracellular concentration variation. Using timescale separation, the fast subsystem perceives slow dynamics as constant, and oscillations are sensed by the slow subsystem. The fast subsystem bifurcation diagram is generated numerically, and the slow subsystem is obtained by averaging the fast dynamics. The model exhibits four regimes: rest, tonic spiking, bursting, and depolar block, associated with healthy and pathological states. Seizures can be triggered by bursting, and depolar block can occur due to insufficient pump activity. The mechanism relies on SN bifurcation and bistable region in the fast subsystem, which is bounded by H and SN branches. The model demonstrates the role of Na+/ATPase in generating slow rhythms and its relevance as a therapeutic target in pathology. The study shows the universality of the mechanism, applying to any neuron with class excitability, and agrees with experimental observations in epilepsy and spreading depolar.
This study presents COPS, a novel R package for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods including similarity-based, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration. Some methods are accessible through R, while others are new approaches proposed by C. The framework was rigorously applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CN, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via Cox models with covariates, and stability. The Pareto criterion was used to evaluate the balance of metrics and identify algorithms on the Pareto frontier. Stability highlighted many algorithms, such as AN, IntMF, and MK-MR with kernels, BW, and PI, were effective in identifying stable and prognostically significant groups. Other methods, such as BW and MKR, yielded results in specific datasets providing trade-offs between stability and survival. Pathway-based methods, BW and PI, seemed promising, but combining with different interaction databases could yield different results. The study emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of multi-clustering methods. Survival and gold agreement are popular metrics but exhibit variance in methods. The interplay between omics in cancer pathogenesis is not fully understood, so subtypes may not represent expected results. Different methods offered trade-offs in each dataset, so test and evaluate variety of criteria, including relevance and stability, to select the most solution.
The study investigates the role of the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic development, specifically in the specification and diversification of the mesodermal lineage. SEM-2 is a conserved in vertebrates and has been implicated in various developmental processes. The study identifies a novel loss-of-function allele, sem-152, with a proline to serine change in the conserved DNA-binding domain of SEM-2, which results in a partial loss of SEM- function. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and specifying the sexmyoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesod lineage. The study shows that SEM- functions antagonistically with LET-381, a forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. SEM- also regulates the expression of hl-8, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and is essential for proliferation and diversification of the SM. The study provides new insights into the gene network underlying C. elegans postembry development and adds to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. SEM-2 is expressed in the mesoblast and remains detectable in all lineage cells until the 16 stage, with higher intensity in SM cells. The P158 mutation affects the activity of SEM- but not its expression or localization. SEM- is required for hl-8 expression in the lineage, which is reduced in sem- P mutants. The study identifies two conserved regions in the hl- promoter, E1 and E2, required for hl- expression in the lineage. E1 contains a putative So-binding site, Site, which is essential for hl- expression. Mutating Site reduces hl- expression but not completely abolishes it. The study proposes a model of SEM- and LET- regulation in the lineage, with SMA- repressing SEM in the dorsal lineage. SEM- is required for SM specification, proliferation, and differentiation of non-stri muscles.
