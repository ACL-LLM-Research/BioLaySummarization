    Title: 
    Article: The intensification of intervention activities against the fatal vector-borne disease gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT, sleeping sickness ) in the last two decades has led to a large decline in the number of annually reported cases. However, while we move closer to achieving the ambitious target of elimination of transmission ( EoT ) to humans, pockets of infection remain, and it becomes increasingly important to quantitatively assess if different regions are on track for elimination, and where intervention efforts should be focused. We present a previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and show that this same formulation is able to capture the dynamics of gHAT observed at the health area level ( approximately 10, 000 people ). This analysis was the first time any stochastic gHAT model has been fitted directly to case data and allows us to better quantify the uncertainty in our results. The analysis focuses on utilising a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methodology to fit the model to the data from 16 health areas of Mosango health zone in Kwilu province as a case study. The spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in modelling results, where we predict that under the current intervention strategies, the health area of Kinzamba II, which has approximately one third of the health zone’s cases, will have the latest expected year for EoT. We find that fitting the analogous deterministic version of the gHAT model using MCMC has substantially faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model using pMCMC, but produces virtually indistinguishable posterior parameterisation. This suggests that expanding health area fitting, to cover more of the DRC, should be done with deterministic fits for efficiency, but with stochastic projections used to capture both the parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations. 
 Mathematical models have an important role in the ability to quantify progress towards or achievement of location elimination of transmission ( EoT ) of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT ) [1]. Cases of gHAT—a parasitic infection with a high probability of severe disease and death if left untreated—have greatly declined in the last two decades, predominantly due to ongoing detection and treatment activities in the endemic regions [2, 3]. However, when the target is EoT, it becomes key to estimate the real number of infections, which cannot directly be observed, to understand where transmission is still ongoing and hence where continued intervention efforts are most crucial [4]. It is thus necessary to develop fine-scale models, such that the spatial distribution of infections can be estimated across the endemic regions. The current spatial distribution of gHAT cases is highly dependent on several geographic factors, such as the density of the disease vector—tsetse ( Glossina spp. ) —suitability for the parasite, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, and the location of human settlements and places of work [5]. These factors mean the distribution of gHAT endemic regions is highly heterogeneous and confined to geographically distinct regions or “foci”, with very few cases detected in areas in between. These foci are typically located in riverine areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where humans and tsetse come into contact [6]. As well as these environmental factors, the local availability of gHAT diagnostics and treatment will also impact the spatial infection distribution. There are long timescales of gHAT infection, which have been estimated at approximately three years before the likely death in the absence of treatment [7]. This means that early diagnosis can substantially reduce the likelihood of onward transmission, by reducing the time people spend infectious and hence the possibility that tsetse will take blood meals on infected people, as well as preventing the worst disease and death in patients. Reductions in the time people spend as infectious, reduce the possibility that tsetse will take blood meals on infected people and cause future transmission [8]. Current gHAT control strategies focus on active and passive screening [9]. Active screening is the use of mobile teams to conduct mass screening of at-risk populations using serological tests, which detect the presence of antibodies to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Positive serological tests are followed up with microscopy for parasitological confirmation before treatment is provided. The current treatment options for gHAT are not recommended for the treatment of non-confirmed individuals [10, 11]. Passive screening is where gHAT cases are detected through self-referral to fixed health facilities and relies on training health staff and the availability of diagnostic screening tests to be able to make diagnoses and administer treatment. Additional interventions such as vector control have also been deployed in selected high-prevalence locations to reduce tsetse populations and hence reduce transmission [12], although operational considerations have prevented the use of vector control in many endemic foci, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) which is a large country with most ( >57% ) of the gHAT case burden for 2021 [2]. The fact that gHAT cases are spatially localised and the interventions to reduce case numbers are implemented in specific locations means that there are great benefits to modelling gHAT at small spatial scales. Several previous studies have only modelled gHAT infections in moderate to large populations. For example, health zones of around 150, 000 people in the DRC [8, 13–16], former provinces of the DRC with more than 8, 000, 000 people [17], foci in Guinea of 14, 500 people [18], Chad foci of 40, 000 people [19, 20] and foci in Côte d’Ivoire of approximately 300, 000 people [21]. These studies fit deterministic models to longitudinal case data, but due to the large populations, there can be large spatial variation within these regions. Some studies have considered modelling individual villages [22, 23], but it is infeasible, both computationally and statistically, to fully fit complex models for all separate endemic villages in a country as large as the DRC. Here, we consider modelling gHAT infection for DRC health areas ( regions of approximately 10, 000 people ). This is small enough to capture local variation in transmission and to define operationally-appropriate intervention areas, yet not so small as to be too computationally intensive to implement across the endemic region, or mean there is insufficient data for each location to fit a model. The relatively small population sizes coupled with expected gHAT prevalence of <1% meant we chose to use a stochastic model to capture the full range of possible model outcomes and uncertainty since the stochastic effects will be relatively larger compared to larger spatial scale studies [24]. A second advantage of stochastic modelling is that it is straightforward to establish at what time in the simulation that elimination of transmission and elimination of infection is achieved, whereas the analogous deterministic model would require us to specific a proxy threshold for elimination [25]—this is most pertinent to our projections forward in time following model calibration. In this manuscript, we use the example health zone of Mosango in Kwliu province, DRC, to fit a stochastic model of gHAT infection to its 16 constituent health areas. This methodology updates the work of Crump et al. [8] and combines tools from Spencer [26], with a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo ( pMCMC ) fitting procedure [27] to allow for calibration of a stochastic transmission model, rather than relying upon fitting a deterministic variant without stochastic, event-driven variation. We assess the quality of model fitting for health areas and compare the benefits of directly fitting the stochastic model, to using a deterministic model, or the outputs from a stochastic model with posterior parameterisation derived from deterministic fitting. We also compare fitting the model to health zone data with the aggregation of model fitting for constituent health areas. While the fitting methodology is updated, we ensure the process remains robust, automated, and replicable, such that multiple stochastic health area models can be fitted simultaneously. We propose a computationally efficient method to fit health area models for all analysable health areas in the DRC. 
 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) HAT Atlas data is a record of the globally reported gHAT cases across [2, 3, 28]. For the present study, we have used the data in the HAT Atlas from the DRC, which includes the location of each case, the year of detection, and the mode of detection ( either active or passive screening ). Where active screening for gHAT has occurred, the total number of people that were screened is given, along with a population estimate for the whole settlement. We used available data for the time period of 2000–2020. Using the geolocations ( latitude and longitude coordinates ) of active screening events or passive detections, we assigned the cases to administrative regions. This includes both health zones ( typically about 150, 000 people ) and health areas ( sub-units of the health zones, typically about 10, 000 people ). For this process, we used shape files provided by Nicole Hoff and Cyrus Sinai under a CC-BY licence ( current versions can be found at https://data. humdata. org/dataset/drc-health-data ) that define the borders between neighbouring health areas. For entries missing geolocations we used the names of villages and health areas to extract the HAT Atlas data, following a similar algorithm to that presented by Crump et al. [8]. We assigned the missing geocations to health areas based on the nearest neighbour. The health areas of Mosango in Kwu province were selected as a case study due to the high number of gAT cases reported in the zone and the relatively small size of the zone, making it feasible to fit a stochastic model to each health area. The zone has 16 health areas, each approximately 10,000 people, with a total population of about 160,000. The zone is located in the north-western part of the DRC, near the border with the Republic of the Congo. The zone has a relatively high gAT prevalence of approximately 1. 5%. The zone has been the focus of previous studies on gAT [8, 29, 30]. We fitted the stochastic gAT model to each health area in the zone using the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM ) methodology [27, 31] to estimate the parameters of the model and quantify the uncertainty in the results. The stochastic model is based on the formulation of Crump et al. [8] and Spencer [26], with the addition of a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to fit the model to the data. The model includes the following parameters : the basic reproduction number ( R0 ), the proportion of cases that are asymptomatic ( p ) the proportion that are symptomatic ( 1− p ) the proportion of symptomatic cases that are reported ( r ) the proportion that are not reported (1− r ) the proportion of reported cases that are treated ( t ) the proportion that are not treated (1− t ) the proportion of treated cases that are cured ( c ) the proportion that are not cured (1− c ) the proportion of cured cases that are infectious ( i ) the proportion that are not infectious (1− i ) the proportion of infectious cases that die ( d ) the proportion that do not die (1− d ) the proportion of deaths that are reported ( ) the proportion that are not reported (− ) the proportion of reported deaths that are due to gAT ( ) the proportion due to other causes (1− ) the proportion of deaths due to gAT that are reported ( ) the proportion due to other causes (− ) the proportion of deaths due to other causes that are reported ( ) the proportion due to gAT ( ) the proportion due other (− ) the proportion due to gAT that are reported ( ) the due other (− ) the proportion due to g that are reported ( ) the due ( ) the proportion due to that are ( ) the ( the due ) the proportion that are ( the ) the ( the ) the ( the ) the ( the ( the ) the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the ( the (

    Title: 
    Article: Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells. 
 Recent advances in cancer treatment, such as immune checkpoint inhibition and other cancer immunotherapies, have sparked a growing interest in studying the cellular composition and spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment ( TME ). The latest innovations in imaging technologies allow for single cell resolution of specific proteins, facilitating in-depth study of the spatial arrangement of cell types within the TME. A wide variety of technologies are available for this purpose, each with different benefits and trade-offs [1–7]. For a review of the available technologies see [8]. In comparing TME data, different spatial relationships between cell types, e. g. between tumor cells and specific immune cell populations, and/or individual proteins, often appear predictive of patient outcomes and may guide therapeutic interventions; see for example [9]. Comparisons between cancer subtypes, e. g. hormone-positive versus hormone-negative breast cancers, or lung squamous cell carcinoma vs lung adenocarcinoma, may provide novel insight into tumor biology and guide the development of treatments. A further goal is to identify specific spatial relationships observed in particular patient’s tumor that are useful in predicting an outcome, such as patient survival or response to therapy. Recent results demonstrate that TME data can be used for such prediction in a variety of tumor types [10, 11]. We consider such prediction problems for data sets generated from tumors imaged with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ( MIBI ) by means of the MIBIscope in this paper. The MIBIscope uses ion-beam ablation and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to detect up to approximately 40 protein markers on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue. Thus, it provides comprehensive data on cell characteristics and their localisation at a single-cell resolution of around 250–400nm [12, 13]. Such data collected on the TME can be considered as marked spatial point patterns [14–16]. The cell locations can be considered as points within the pattern, with cell phenotypes and/or protein markers giving the “marks”. An example of such a point process generated from a tumor imaged using MIBIscope is shown in Fig 1a [12]. Existing methods developed to study cellular interactions in the TME have exploited cell neighborhood analysis in which the spatial relationship between a cell of interest and its neighboring cells can reveal particular cell-cell interactions associated with a disease state or changes associated with response to therapy; see e. g. [17]. Pairwise cell-to-cell distance calculations over iterations of randomized permutations has also been used to identify relevant cell-cell interactions [18]. However, the substantial number of cell types present in the TME leads to a very large number of potential pairwise interactions creating a major challenge in finding interactions that may be meaningful and statistically significant in predicting outcomes of interest. There is ongoing interest in applying spatial statistics methods to similar biological data sets, e. g. [19–21]. A common method of analysing spatial point patterns, such as those that arise in TME imaging, is to consider Ripley’s K function [22–24]. The K function describes the distribution of inter-point distances in a given point pattern, giving an indication as to whether points in the pattern ( e. g. cells ) are clustered or dispersed with respect to one another. The K function, along with other summary functions from spatial statistics, has previously been employed in the analysis of the TME [25–31]. An example of a K function showing the relative distribution of a specific immune cell type around tumor cells within a MIBIscope image from a triple negative breast cancer patient is shown in Fig 1b. In this paper, we present a general framework for analyzing and identifying useful spatial relationships in the TME through predicting an outcome of interest. The method we propose uses a novel combination of spatial statistics and functional data analysis, in conjunction with methods in ensemble machine learning. The application of functional data analysis to spatial point pattern data is a recent development [31–35]. Our approach begins by producing K functions for the different cell-cell, ( or alternatively marker-marker ), interactions within images. After performing dimension reduction using functional principal components analysis [36], these data are combined with non-functional patient meta-data, such as age or sex, and a modified random forest model is used to predict the patient outcome. Motivated by [37], in order to evaluate the predictive power of the spatial interactions, “knock-off” point patterns that mimic the spatial data in the TME are generated, via permutation, independently of the responses. The importance of specific spatial interactions in predicting the response are evaluated by comparison to the predictive power of the knock-off spatial patterns. This approach overcomes the challenge of distinguishing important spatial interactions among many potential interactions of interest, i. e. it controls the false discovery rate. It also lends itself to the generation of easy-to-interpret plots showing which interactions are useful in predicting the response. Moreover, it grants high power for even a relatively few number of cells due to the robustness of the K functions, and high power even with small sample sizes. Small sample sizes are a relatively common obstacle for this type of data. To our knowledge the method we propose is the first to evaluate for the importance of spatial interactions in the TME that may vary over distance with a large number of potential cell interactions. Many statistical methods proposed to date rely on simple summaries of the images, such as the average number of cells observed, or otherwise simplify the data by, for example, initially clustering cells into groups ( e. g. [10, 18, 38–41] ). In other comparable methods available in the literature, a single distance of interest is considered ( e. g. [12, 26, 42] ). [30] provides an approach for detecting differences across multiple images between cell-cell interactions by comparing the integrated difference between a spatial summary function similar to the K function and its expected value under complete spatial randomness. However, this approach only considers individual spatial interactions, while we wish to consider all interactions in a single model. Additionally, a possible drawback of the approach in [30] is that integration over the summary statistic may lose valuable information relating to differences in the shape of the functions, since differently shaped spatial summary functions may still have the same integral. [31] uses a related functional linear model based on interaction distance functions, although this approach is not tailored to examine a large number of interactions simultaneously. Some methods may predict well, but do not lead to interpretable results that allow for the importance of individual spatial characteristics to be compared. Other methods consider only a single image or an equal number of images per patient. This is further complicated by the fact that some images do not contain all cell types. However, our approach is interpretable and able to be used to analyse data with multiple, possibly differing, numbers of observations per patient. Additionally, images may have different shapes or sizes. In that sense, our approach allows for the complete use of the data. We apply the proposed methods to two MIBIscope data sets; a data set of triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patients, and a data set consisting of both lung squamous cell carcinomas ( LUSC ) and lung adenocarcinomas ( LUAD ). Regarding the TNBC data, our method was accurately able to identify clustered versus dispersed tumors when compared to [12], and was additionally able to identify important cell spatial interactions in making that determination. Our method also indicated that there did not appear to be measurable differences in the spatial arrangement of tumor and immune cell types, as measured by homogeneous K functions, between the LUSC and LUAD groups. Whilst the methodology presented here is motivated by, and applied to, MIBIscope data, it can be applied to similar data generated by other technologies, e. g. OPAL, Phenocycler Fusion, Merscope, Xenium and Cosmx [43–49]. Furthermore, the methodology can easily extend beyond two-dimensions to higher-dimensional images, another area of active research [50]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the section Materials and methods, we give a detailed description of the data we consider and the methods to analyze them, including sub-sections on how we fit a modified random forest in this setting, and how we evaluate the statistical significance and uncertainty in measuring the variable importance of spatial interactions of cell types as encoded by K functions. We also introduce the R package funkycells ( shortened version of functional data analysis of K functions for multiplex imaging data. In the Results section, we present the results of our analysis of the TNBC and LUS/LUAD data sets. In the Discussion, we discuss the implications of our results and limitations of the method. We conclude with a final thoughts on future directions. 

The article discusses the importance of studying the tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer research, particularly in the context of emerging immunotherapies. The authors propose a novel approach to analyze spatial relationships in the TME using spatial functions and functional analysis, and random forest models to predict outcomes and identify important interactions. This approach is shown to be effective in simulations and real data from Multiplex Ion Beam Imaging (MIB) of triple negative breast and lung cancer patients. The method is publicly available in a R package called funkells. The study highlights the challenges in analyzing T data due to the large number of cell interactions and the need to control the false discovery rate. The proposed method overcomes this by generating knock-off patterns to mimic the data and evaluating the importance of spatial interactions. The approach is interpretable and can be used with small sample sizes and multiple images per patient. The authors apply the method to two data sets, TNBC and LUS/LUAD, and identify important spatial interactions in TNBC and no differences in LUS/LU. The methodology can be extended to other technologies and higher dimensions. 

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

    Title: 
    Article: Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function, as observed in several brain disorders. We computationally study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, in particular, during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation. To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ), ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ), i. e., without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP, ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP, i. e., without weight-dependent pruning, and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model, enabling detailed numerical analyses. With tools from network theory, we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony. When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. In particular, the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ). The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e. g., in Parkinson’s disease. 
 Neurons form networks that are plastic in nature. The spiking dynamics of neurons, the weight ( transmission efficiency ) of the synaptic contacts, and the structure of the networks can change with time [1–4]. The plastic nature of neuronal networks enables learning and memory [5, 6], stabilization of networks in spontaneous and experience-induced conditions [7, 8], and recovery and rehabilitation after stroke and injuries [9–11]. Alterations in neural plasticity may support pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) [12, 13] and epilepsy [14]. Models of plastic neuronal networks are used to study the functioning of specific brain areas in healthy and disordered conditions and to develop therapeutic stimulation methods [15–20]. Plastic networks of leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) model neurons have been used to design and validate effective stimulation methods such as coordinated and random reset ( CR and RR ) stimulation [21–24], which leverage the synaptic weight plasticity to induce therapeutic effects. The weight of a synaptic contact can change depending on the exact timing of the spikes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons [25, 26]. This mechanism is termed STDP [26–28]. Networks of LIF neurons with STDP can display bistablily by residing in either a synchronized or a desynchronized state [21–24], which mimic the pathological and physiological states, respectively, in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) and Basal Ganglia of patients with PD [29–31]. Stimulation can be employed to counteract abnormal synchrony and induce long-term desynchronization [24, 32–34]. In the case of Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ), the desynchronized spiking and decoupling of neurons is observed during disease progression [35, 36]. The re-synchronization of the fast-spiking interneurons restores the gamma oscillations in the hippocampus, reducing the impairment of cognitive function in AD patients [37]. SP is another noted form of plasticity that reorganizes the network structure via addition and elimination ( pruning ) of synaptic contacts depending on the activity of the neurons, referred to as synaptic reorganization, besides sprouting and reshaping of synaptic elements [4, 6]. The addition and pruning of synaptic contacts may depend on several factors, such as the synaptic weight, firing rates of the neurons, and the physical distance between neurons [4, 38, 39]. In particular, weaker synaptic contacts are more prone to pruning than the strong ones [38, 40–42]. The form of SP that may add or remove synaptic contacts to maintain a homeostatic set-point of the firing rate of the neurons is termed homeostatic SP [4, 6]. Neurons extend their neurites ( axons and dendrites ), which may reach each other to form potential synaptic contacts [43, 44]. In principle, axons and dendrites of any two neurons may form potential synaptic contacts at multiple locations, some of which may turn into actual synaptic contacts as the synaptic elements ( axonal boutons and dendritic spines ) bridge the gap between the axons and the dendrites [43, 45]. On the one hand, it allows for the formation of multiple contacts between a pair of neurons [43, 46, 47]. On the other hand, it makes nearby neurons more likely to connect, producing distance-dependent connectivity [48]. Structural changes in a network occur at a much longer timescale than synaptic weight change ( due to STDP ) and neuronal spiking dynamics [4, 6]. Activity-dependent changes in the structure of a network have been implemented in several studies that aimed to reproduce experimentally observed network behaviors and statistics of connectivity besides identifying the mechanisms underlying the synaptic reorganization of network [6, 46, 47, 49]. Synchrony of a network of non-identical oscillators can be enhanced by employing specific alterations in the network structure [50, 51] and in networks of FitzHugh Nagumo model neurons, synchrony can be enhanced by a combination of STDP and homeostatic SP ( hSP ) [52]. In networks of oscillators that may represent certain oscillatory neuronal networks, the synaptic reorganization could significantly affect the network dynamics and its response to stimulation compared to networks with fixed structure [53]. The structural properties of the network have been studied using tools from network science, such as node degree distribution and correlation, clustering coefficient, average path length, and assortativity [54–56]. Networks of oscillators that evolve with SP show degree-frequency correlations, while such correlations may be absent in random graphs [50, 53]. The assortativity is linked to certain network properties, e. g. stability, robustness, and information content [56, 57]; real-world networks, such as neural networks and co-authorship networks are either assortative or dissasortative [56]. In practice, multiple measures are often used together as one metric may not suffice to describe and distinguish the structural properties of different networks. In the present study, we employ degree distribution, degree-frequency and degree-degree correlations, and degree assortativity measures to fully describe the network structure and distinguish between the structure that emerges due to synaptic reorganization in the presence of SP and that of random networks. The timescales of neuronal spiking and changes in synaptic weights and network structure are rather distinct. Whereas the spiking activity may occur at a sub-second timescale, the synaptic weight and structural changes may take minutes to hours [58] and hours to days [59, 60], respectively. Incorporating all three in a computational study thus poses the challenge of maintaining such distinct timescales while keeping the network model computationally less costly so that a detailed analysis of the network dynamics may be conducted. Here, we combine the LIF neuron model with a standard additive STDP rule and introduce a stochastic SP rule that adds and eliminates synaptic contacts based on the firing rate of a postsynaptic neuron and the weight of the contacts. The network model maintains the distinction between the timescales of neuronal activity and plasticity mechanisms. The stochastic SP method is computationally fast and we compare it with a prevailing method introduced in Ref. [61], referred to as Butz and van Ooyen SP ( BvOSP ) in this study, which is neuroscientifically informed but computationally costlier [20]. We show that our stochastic SP method produces network dynamics similar to those by BvOSP. We aim to study the effect of the two distinct plasticity mechanisms ( synaptic weight and structural ) on the dynamical states of the network and to understand the co-evolution of network activity and structure ( synaptic reorganization ). As shown computationally, stimulus responses of neural networks with STDP may significantly differ from stimulus responses in networks with fixed coupling strength, i. e., fixed synaptic weights [21, 23, 24, 33, 62, 63]. STDP may cause a multistability [64, 65], and properly designed stimuli may move networks from one attractor to another, qualitatively different attractor, in this way causing long-term stimulus effects that persist after cessation of stimulation [21, 23, 24, 33, 62, 63]. In general, stimulus-induced reshaping of adaptive systems may have various applications in various fields of applications [66]. For instance, in a clinical context, fundamental predictions derived from stimulated networks with STDP were key for the development of CR and RR stimulation [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 43, 44, 45 46, 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406

    Title: 
    Article: Some animals can regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system, requiring mechanisms to restore the pattern, numbers, and wiring of diverse neuron classes. Because injuries are unpredictable, regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points. Coordinated regeneration of neuron-glia architecture is thus a major challenge and remains poorly understood. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors. We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene, delta-2, at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Planarian glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location. Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types. 
 In animal regeneration certain cell types might need to form in correct relative numbers and positions, a problem referred to here as coordinated regeneration. For example, neurons and glia for certain contexts need to be regenerated in a coordinated architecture, even if they arise from different progenitors. We address this problem of coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians. Planarians are freshwater flatworms that belong to the Spiralian superphylum [1] and are capable of whole-body regeneration and constant tissue turnover. These processes involve a proliferating population of stem cells called neoblasts. Neoblasts are heterogeneous, being comprised of multiple fate-specified classes with distinct gene expression signatures [2–4]. Most differentiated cell types have a corresponding subset of progenitors within the neoblast compartment [3, 4]. Many invertebrates and vertebrates share multipotent progenitors that can give rise to neurons and glial cells ( Fig 1A and [5–9] ). Planarian glia have been established to be specified from “cathepsin+” or phagocytic progenitors, which are distinct from neuron progenitors [4, 10–12]. This phagocytic neoblast class also produces multiple subsets of other phagocytic cells, including pigment cells. Interestingly, these progenitors have transcriptome similarity to muscle progenitors ( shared PLOD1 and FoxF-1 expression ), indicating they have a mesoderm-like identity [3, 4]. Even though most glia in other organisms have been described to be of neuroepithelial origin ( ectoderm ), in most organisms a subset of mesodermal ( e. g., microglia in vertebrates and GLR glia in C. elegans ) or mesectoderm ( midline glia in Drosophila ) derived glial cells have also been described [13–15]. Some neoblast classes, such as for muscle, are comprised of distinct subsets, each displaying a specification program associated with a particular differentiated muscle type ( e. g., longitudinal, circular, intestinal, dorsal-ventral, pharyngeal ) [4, 10, 16]. By contrast, phagocytic specialized neoblasts do not display overt fate specification programs associated with one of their final fate outcomes [4], raising the possibility that their final fate choice is regulated at a later stage–in the migratory post-mitotic progenitors these neoblasts produce. Planarian glia express several astrocyte-like genes, including excitatory amino acid transporters involved in the uptake of neurotransmitters, glutamine synthetase for metabolizing glutamate, and transporters for GABA and glucose [17, 18]. Planarian glia are found within the neuropil of both the cephalic ganglia and the ventral cords, around commissural neurons connecting the ventral cords, in the head rim where sensory neurons are found, associated with eyes, and dorsally scattered around the animal midline ( Fig 1A, [11, 17, 18] ). Planarian neurons regenerate prior to glia formation, and various disruptions in the nervous system appear to block glia formation through unknown mechanisms [11]. Given the coordinated regeneration of planarian neurons and glia, and the lack of known glial fate specification programs in the stem cell state, we considered the possibility that some signaling mechanism between the nervous system and phagocytic progenitors could specify glia. The Notch signaling pathway is essential for cell-fate specification and tissue patterning throughout the Metazoa. A Notch ligand, such as Delta or Jagged/Serrate, binds to a Notch receptor expressed on an adjacent cell, activating a proteolytic cascade that ultimately elicits a transcriptional response in the Notch-expressing cell [19]. This prominent signaling pathway is utilized in numerous developmental contexts, from Drosophila and vertebrate neurogenesis to Drosophila wing-disc patterning, C. elegans vulval development, and vertebrate somitogenesis [20–25]. In Drosophila neurogenesis, Notch is required to select individual cells to become neural precursors from a cluster of equipotent progenitors that express proneural genes. In the absence of Notch signaling, these progenitors retain the expression of proneural genes and produce neuronal fates. Conversely, if Notch signaling is constitutively activated, progenitors do not differentiate into neurons but adopt an epidermal fate [26]. Similarly, in vertebrates, Notch signaling regulates the timing of neurogenesis and the differentiation of neural stem cells into neuronal progenitors and differentiated neurons [24, 25, 27–29]. Notch signaling has been implicated in regulating different aspects of gliogenesis in both Drosophila and vertebrates. In vertebrates, Notch can promote a gliogenic switch, ending neurogenesis [28, 30]. In Drosophila, Notch also regulates the expression of glial cells missing ( gcm ), which is necessary and sufficient to specify glial cells [31, 32], and can trigger glia expansion and differentiation of different glial subtypes [33–36]. Given the prominent role of Notch signaling in neuron-glia development, we sought to explore whether Notch signaling serves some role in planarian glia regeneration, distinct from its role in neuronal progenitors seen during development in many organisms. Based on our findings, we describe a model in which patterned expression of a Delta protein in particular neurons interacts with Notch-expressing, dispersed phagocytic progenitors to accomplish coordinated regeneration of planarian neurons and glia. 
 Planarians have two genes encoding Notch proteins ( notch-1 and notch-2 ), seven encoding Delta and Jagged/Serrate-family homologs ( delta-1, delta-2, delta-3, delta-4, delta-5, delta-6, jagged-1 ), one gene encoding a suppressor of Hairless homolog ( su ( H ) ), and three Hes-like genes ( hesl-1, hesl-2, hesl-3; [37] ) ( S1A Fig and [38] ). We assessed the function of these genes using RNA interference ( RNAi ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) to label glia using the planarian glia markers estrella [18], if-1, and cali [17] ( Figs 1B–1D and S1B–S1E ). Strikingly, inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and su ( H ) caused a complete failure of neuropil glia regeneration following head amputation ( Fig 1B and 1C ). By contrast, we did not observe any obvious change in the number or pattern of other “cathepsin+”/phagocytic cells ( using a pool of RNA probes specific to that cell class ) after notch-1, delta-2, and su ( H ) RNAi ( Fig 1C ). After inhibition of these genes during regeneration, glia were also absent from the head rim, eyes, and dorsal surface, suggesting a robust role for Notch signaling in glia formation across all locations of the planarian nervous system ( S1C Fig ). Glia maintenance, like regeneration, required Notch signaling. 11 days after the initiation of RNAi for notch-1, delta-2, and su ( H ), estrella-expressing glia were not detectable around the eyes, head rim, dorsal midline, and ventral nerve cords of uninjured animals ( Figs 1D and S1D ). Some estrella+ cells were still present at this early time point within the neuropil of the cephalic ganglia, the region with the most abundant glia in the planarian nervous system ( Fig 1D ) but were mostly depleted from this region and completely absent from the head rim, eyes, and the dorsal surface at later time points ( S1D Fig ). Similarly, cells positive for an RNA probe pool of multiple other glia-expressing genes ( eaat2-2, gs, glut, if-1, cal-1 ) were not detectable after notch-1, delta-2, and su ( ) RNAi ( Figs 1E–G and S1E–G ). Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and su ( ) did not affect the number or pattern of other “hein+” phoc cells ( Figs 1C and S1C ), indicating that Notch signaling is specific to glia and not other phoc cell types. Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and ( ) also did not affect the number or pattern of neurons ( Figs 1 and S1 ), indicating that Notch signaling is specific to glia and not neurons. Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and ( ) did not affect the number of neoblasts ( Figs 1 and S ), indicating that Notch signaling is specific to glia and not neoblasts. Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and ( ) did not affect the number of muscle cells ( Figs 1 and S ) indicating that Notch signaling is specific to glia and not muscle. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 and ( ) did not affect the number of pigment cells (igs 1 and S ) indicating that Notch is specific to glia and pigment cells. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 and ( ) did not affect the number of intestinal cells (igs and S ) indicating Notch is specific to gl and intestinal cells. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 and ( ) did not affect the number of longitudinal muscle (igs and S ) indicating Notch is specific gl and longitudinal muscle. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 ( ) did not affect the number of circular muscle (igs and S ) indicating Notch is specific gl and circular muscle. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 ( ) did not affect the number of dorsal-ventral muscle (igs S ) indicating Notch is gl and dorsalventral muscle. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 ( ) did not affect the number of pharyngeal (igs S ) indicating Notch is gl pharyngeal. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 ( ) did not affect the number of epidermal (igs ) indicating Notch is gl epidermal. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 ( ) did not affect the number of neurons (igs ) indicating Notch is gl neurons. Inhibition of notch-1 delta-2 ( ) did not affect the number of sensory (igs ) indicating Notch gl sensory.

    Title: 
    Article: New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies. We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development. We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI, and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. In addition, the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM. Thus, γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth, which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies. 
 Vaccination is considered a key tool to prevent acquisition and transmission of infectious pathogens. However, vaccination against HIV-1 remains elusive due to the sequence diversity of the HIV-1 envelope ( glyco ) protein ( Env ) and many other factors. Several current HIV-1 vaccine designs are focusing on generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs ) [1–4]. However, no HIV-1 vaccine has successfully elicited bNAbs. During natural infection, a minority of people living with HIV ( PLWH ) develop bNAbs [5–7]. Therefore, there is great interest in studying the events that lead to bNAb generation in these study participants. Several viral [8–10] and immunological [11–14] factors have been reported to impact bNAb generation. However, most of these studies focused on the chronic phase of infection. Using the RV217 acute HIV infection ( AHI ) cohort [15], we have previously shown that B cell activation and engagement with founder Env within the first month of viremia are predictive of the development of neutralization breadth years later [16]. Understanding the innate and adaptive immune pathways that promote B cell activation in response to HIV-1 infection could inform HIV-1 vaccine design for the elicitation of neutralization breadth. Gamma delta ( γδ ) T cells are important in the immune response to various types of pathogens ranging from viruses to bacteria and fungi [17]. γδ T cells express a limited repertoire of T cell receptor ( TCR ) V-regions and, in contrast to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells, are not restricted by MHC-I or MHC-II. Furthermore, they share features with other innate like T cells, such as activation by cytokines in the absence of TCR signal [18] or by activating receptors usually associated with NK cell functions [19, 20]. In humans, the most common subset in peripheral blood is defined by expression of the Vδ2 chain and recognize non-peptide phosphoantigens produced by some bacteria and protozoa such as Plasmodium falciparum [21, 22]. These phosphoantigens are sensed by the butyrophilin-3A1 and butyrophilin-2A1 complex. Vδ1 T cells are abundant in mucosal tissues but are also found in peripheral blood, albeit at a lower frequency, and the antigens recognized by their TCR are less well defined [23, 24]. One unique feature of γδ T cells is their capacity to become antigen presenting cells [25]. This includes following interaction with opsonized target cells by CD16, the low affinity FcγRIII, at the surface of γδ T cells [26, 27]. γδ T cells can also promote humoral immune responses directly by stimulating the maturation of B cells [28] or indirectly by stimulating the differentiation of T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells [29, 30]. Thus, γδ T cells bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. HIV-1 has a profound impact on γδ T cells. Early reports showed that Vδ1 T cells are expanded in PLWH [31, 32]. In contrast, Vδ2 T cells were found to be decreased and poorly responsive to TCR stimulation in PLWH [33]. As a result of their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, Vδ2 T cells have been found to contribute to the viral reservoirs present in PLWH on antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) [34]. Additionally, γδ T cells have been reported to have anti-HIV activity by producing β-chemokines that can block viral entry or by direct cytotoxicity against HIV-infected cells ( reviewed in [35] ). Thus, γδ T cells could impact HIV disease by modulating the adaptive immune system and by influencing viral replication either by their anti-viral activity or by supporting viral replication. Here, we investigated γδ T cells prior to HIV-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in RV217 individuals previously identified as ‘broad’ and ‘non-broad’ neutralizers, and determined their relationship with viral replication as well as bNAb elicitation. We found that Vδ2+ T cells were significantly reduced during early AHI and their loss was associated with viral load. On the contrary, Vδ1 T cells expansion occurred only during chronic HIV infection ( CHI ), and was not associated with viral load. Expression levels of CD16 on Vδ1+ T cells as well as CD57 on Vδ2+ T cells during AHI were higher in participants that developed breadth and were significantly associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. Furthermore, levels of CD16 expression on Vδ1+ T cells were associated with early founder Env specific IgM production. Our results suggest that γδ T cells might be important for early promotion of B cell engagement following HIV-1 acquisition and subsequent development of neutralization breadth. 
 Samples from the previously described RV217 ECHO [15] cohort were utilized. Consenting adults from key populations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Thailand were enrolled at clinical research sites. The protocol was approved by appropriate local review boards ( Kenya Medical Research Institute Ethics Review Committee FWA00002066, National Institute for Medical Research FWA00002632, Mbeya Medical Research Ethics Committee FWA00032379, Uganda National Council for Science and Technology National HIV/AIDS Research Committee FWA00001293, and Royal Thai Army Medical Department IRB FWA 00001813 ) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research IRB ( FWA 00000015 ), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in their written languages. Participants were screened twice weekly for HIV-1 RNA by finger pricks and nucleic acid amplification testing ( NAAT; Aptima HIV-1 RNA Qualitative test, Hologic Inc., San Diego, CA ). Participants with reactive NAAT ( HIV RNA+ ) were enrolled in a second phase of the study that included intensive sampling of larger blood volumes throughout AHI and into CHI. Individuals were monitored longitudinally over time twice weekly for viral load and rising and declining viral loads allowed for identification of a peak and setpoint viral load timepoint [15]. All participants tested and determined to be living with HIV-1 were referred to care providers for management of the infection based on national guidelines, which did not incorporate routine treatment of acute infection until the START trial results were announced in 2015. From that point onward everyone was treated, regardless of national treatment initiation criteria. Prior to that time, we treated anyone with severe acute retroviral syndrome and did not prevent anyone from starting treatment if they and their physician chose to initiate treatment. Treatment was usually available at no cost through host nation care and treatment programs. The cases presented in this study include 22 selected RV217 participants described in a previous study that investigated the development of neutralization breadth [16]. Eleven of the participants were identified as broad neutralizers ( defined as demonstrating neutralization breadth > 70% on a panel of 34 diverse pseudoviruses ), and 11 were identified as non-broad neutralizers ( defined as demonstrating < 35% neutralization breadth after 3 years of being in the study ). None of these study participants had a super infection and five participants that developed neutralization breadth had confirmed multiple founder viruses [9]. Samples from these individuals were selected at four longitudinal time points as defined: prior to the detection of HIV-1 RNA ( pre-acquisition ), peak viral load ( VL ) ( median days since first positive test for HIV-1 RNA = 18 days ), set point VL ( median days since first positive test for HIV-1 RNA = 42 ), and CHI ( median days since first positive test for HIV-1 RNA = 980 ). Cryopreserved PBMC samples were thawed in media containing 20% fetal bovine serum ( Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA ). Cell counts and viabilities were assessed using trypan blue and a countess II instrument ( ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA ). Cells were washed and stained with Aqua Live/Dead stain ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes at room temperature ( RT ), washed again, and blocked using normal mouse IgG ( ThermoFisher ) 15 minutes at RT. Following washes, the cells were surface stained at RT for 30 minutes with CD69 BB660 ( FW50, ( BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA ), ⍺4β7 AF-647 ( Act-1, Invitrogen ), San Diego, CA, CD16 FITC ( Invitrogen ), CD57 FITC ( Invitrogen ), CD3 FITC ( Invitrogen, CD4 FITC ( Invitrogen, CD8 FITC ( Invitrogen, CD8 FITC (itrogen, CD8 FIT (itrogen, CD8 (itrogen CD (it CDitrogen CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CDit CD

    Title: 
    Article: The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design. 
 Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) play key roles in inflammation and have been implicated in cancer progression. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that, along with TNFα and IL-1β, contributes to the early response to infection [1]. IL-6 is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells in response to pathogens, and this cytokine drives T cell differentiation as well as plasma B cell differentiation [2]. IL-8 ( CXCL8 ) is a chemokine produced by monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and other cells [3–5], and it is responsible for attracting leukocytes ( typically but not exclusively neutrophils ) to the site of inflammation by enhancing extravasation and by chemoattraction within tissue [4]. Both IL-6 and IL-8 have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of several solid tumor types, including breast [6], prostate [7], colon [8], and pancreatic [9] cancers, and indeed elevated expression of both molecules has been associated with increased cancer aggressiveness and metastatic burden [8, 10, 11]. It has recently been demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-8 paracrine signaling in metastatic cancer cells increases motility in a cell density-dependent manner [12]. Above a threshold cell density, cancer cells secrete IL-6 and IL-8, which synergistically activate a complex paracrine signaling pathway via Janus kinase ( JAK2 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) that prompts cancer cells to form Arp2/3-dependent dendritic protrusions and undergo migration. Simultaneous inhibition of the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network with tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor-alpha ( IL-6Rα, hereafter denoted IL-6R ) antibody primarily used to treat rheumatoid arthritis [13], and reparixin, a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of the IL-8 receptor ( IL-8R ) that recently completed phase II clinical trials against breast cancer [14], was found to decrease in vitro cell migration and significantly decrease in vivo metastasis without affecting rates of tumor growth [12, 15]. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis and cancer lethality. Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) have been a fixture in anti-cancer therapeutic regimens over the past 20 years [16, 17] due to their target specificity, in vivo stability, modular construction, and multi-faceted actions. However, monospecific mAbs have limitations, including the emergence of acquired resistance as cancer cells mutate [18]. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), antibodies engineered to simultaneously engage two different target molecules, demonstrate great potential to overcome the shortcomings of antibody drugs [19–21]. Binding in cis, i. e., with the BsAb bridging different receptors on the same cell, confers avidity, improved tissue selectivity, and reduced off-target side effects [22–24], while also reducing the likelihood of drug resistance [25]. Additionally, concurrent binding to separate targets can prevent receptor homodimerization [26] and increase treatment potency in target tissues [27]. To study and potentially better target the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network for metastasis inhibition, Yang and colleagues recently engineered a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, against IL-6R and IL-8RB ( also known as CXCR2, hereafter called IL-8R ) [28]. BS1 contains arms with variable domains of two distinct antibodies: the anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab and the anti-IL-8R antibody 10H2 [5, 29] ( Fig 1A ). BS1 significantly reduced in vitro cancer cell migration, effecting greater inhibition of migration than either the combination of tocilizumab and reparixin or the combination of tocilizumab and 10H2 [28]. Furthermore, BS1 potently decreased metastatic burden in vivo in orthotopic mouse xenograft models and, when paired with the anti-proliferative agent gemcitabine, significantly decreased both metastasis and tumor growth [28]. In all studies, BS1 outperformed combination treatments, demonstrating the effectiveness of bispecific agents in targeting complex signaling networks. However, while the dual-targeting ability of BsAbs holds promise, it will be crucial to understand the mechanisms underpinning BsAb binding and how those mechanisms differ from treatment with a combination of monospecific mAbs in order to maximize efficacy. As antibodies are multivalent, their binding is driven both by the inherent affinity of each binding domain for its target antigen and by avidity, the accumulated binding strength from each of the individual molecular interactions [30–32]. While it has been established that avidity plays a key role in BsAb tissue selectivity and therapeutic efficacy [23, 33], the interplay of individual domain affinity, overall avidity, target expression, and therapeutic concentration in the context of cell binding remains poorly understood. Mechanistic computational models of antibody-target interactions can address this knowledge gap—by incorporating parameters for both monovalent binding affinity and multivalent binding avidity with differential equations describing the binding kinetics, we can investigate the influence of these factors on the binding of monospecific and bispecific antibodies [34–36]. Mathematical models of the kinetics of heterobivalent antibody binding to cell surface targets have been characterized previously [24, 37–41], providing a general framework for modeling multivalent binding. The modeling approaches and findings from those works are well summarized in a recent comprehensive review [34]. Briefly, Harms et al. [38] simulated BsAbs with different inherent cross-linking efficiencies ( i. e., different propensities to form receptor-antibody-receptor complexes ) to explore the impact of cross-linking on antibody potency. The models presented by van Steeg et al. [24] and Rhoden et al. [39] each approximated the rate of cross-linking based on the effective local receptor concentration in proximity of the bound antibody, analyzing binding across cell lines with different receptor expressions to aid in the design of bispecific therapeutics. Sengers et al. [40] simulated the kinetics of receptor-antibody-receptor complex formation as diffusion-limited to model BsAb binding at low receptor densities. Here, we extend existing general modeling frameworks to build a quantitative, computational model for a specific therapeutic target: antibodies targeting the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors for the prevention of cancer metastasis. To therapeutically inhibit IL-6/IL-8-mediated metastasis, we are examining two existing monospecific antibodies, tocilizumab ( denoted anti-IL-6R ) [42] and 10H2 ( denoted anti-IL-8R ) [5, 29], and the novel bispecific antibody, BS1 ( denoted anti-IL-6R/anti-IL-8R ), first described by Yang et al. [28] ( Fig 1A ). Binding mechanics ( receptor complex formation ) of each antibody are expressed in a series of coupled differential equations, and we use quantitative experimental data of the interactions of antibodies with IL-6R and IL-8R to estimate the kinetic constants for the system and create a complete model of antibody interactions that is faithful to the biophysics. Our detailed simulations of the in vitro monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the target receptors, IL-6R and IL-8R, establish how binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complex formation are influenced by the properties of the antibody and conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate how the balance of these types of complexes drives receptor inhibition, providing generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.

    Title: 
    Article: Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types, oocytes of most species lack these structures. During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles, but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure. Simultaneously, microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization. How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood. Here, we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division, but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood. We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects. Importantly, experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. Further, we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. Altogether, our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis. 
 In most cell types, centrosomes function to nucleate and organize a microtubule-based spindle [1]. However, oocytes of most species lack centrosomes and yet are able to form a bipolar spindle [2, 3]. In human oocytes, these acentrosomal spindles have been shown to be highly unstable; after bipolarity is achieved, the poles often split apart, and this instability leads to a high incidence of chromosome segregation errors [4]. The mechanisms by which oocyte spindles are formed and stabilized are thus important to understand. In recent years, C. elegans has emerged as a powerful model to dissect mechanisms that promote acentrosomal spindle assembly and maintenance, since rapid depletion methods have been developed that enable the removal of proteins from oocytes within minutes [5, 6]. These methods have made it possible to either deplete proteins prior to spindle formation, to probe for roles in spindle assembly, or to remove proteins from pre-formed spindles and then assess effects on the stability of the structure [7–9]. In C. elegans oocytes, assembly of the spindle begins with nuclear envelope breakdown. Microtubules initially nucleate and form a cage-like structure around the meiotic chromosomes. Subsequently, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards to form multiple poles that eventually coalesce into two distinct poles [10–12]. Thus, to generate a stable spindle structure, forces must be produced during spindle assembly to sort microtubules outwards, and then these forces must be balanced after the spindle forms to maintain proper spindle size. KLP-18/kinesin-12, a plus-end directed microtubule motor, sorts microtubule minus ends outwards to establish bipolarity; depletion of KLP-18 results in a monopolar spindle in which microtubule minus ends coalesce into a single pole at the center with plus ends radiating outwards [10, 13]. KLP-18 is also required to maintain spindle bipolarity; if KLP-18 is inactivated after the bipolar spindle has already formed, the two poles converge together to create a monopolar spindle [14]. A recent study demonstrated that in addition to KLP-18, another plus end directed motor, BMK-1/kinesin-5, also provides outward force on the spindle. Although BMK-1 depletion does not cause defects on its own since KLP-18 provides the primary outward force [15, 13], a role for BMK-1 was revealed in experimental conditions where KLP-18 was depleted [8]. Interestingly, this study also demonstrated that dynein provides an inward force on the spindle; acute dynein depletion caused the spindle to elongate and the poles to splay. Thus, a balance of motor-generated outward and inward forces is essential to form and maintain the acentrosomal spindle in C. elegans oocytes. In addition to motors, other factors are also necessary for spindle stability. Removal of the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 from pre-formed spindles causes microtubules in the center of the spindle to splay and poles to split, suggesting that regulation of microtubule dynamics is essential for the spindle to maintain its structure [9]. Similarly, it has been shown that control of microtubule length and number are essential for proper spindle assembly. Depletion of the microtubule depolymerase MCAK results in the formation of disorganized spindles with longer microtubules [11, 12, 16, 17]. Moreover, mutating the microtubule severing enzyme katanin entirely prevents spindle assembly [18–20]; this enzyme converts long microtubules into shorter fragments, thus increasing polymer number to promote spindle assembly [21]. Therefore, precise tuning of microtubule number, length, and dynamics is essential for the spindle to properly form and maintain its structure. Although it is known that force balance and microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled in the acentrosomal spindle, the mechanisms by which this control is achieved are not well understood. Here, we provide insight into these mechanisms through analysis of ZYG-8, a conserved microtubule-associated protein. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain [22]. Previous studies using a series of temperature-sensitive zyg-8 mutants demonstrated that ZYG-8 is required for proper spindle positioning in C. elegans mitotically dividing embryos [22, 23]. Moreover, analysis of astral microtubule dynamics demonstrated that ZYG-8 depletion led to reduced growth rates and increased nucleation rates, demonstrating that ZYG-8 modulates microtubule dynamics in mitosis [24]. In oocytes, ZYG-8 is required for anaphase B spindle elongation [25] and a recent study demonstrated that it excludes the microtubule crosslinker SPD-1PRC1 from the anaphase spindle, thus regulating spindle structure during chromosome segregation [26]. While this study also noted that there were metaphase spindle defects following ZYG-8 depletion, the question of how ZYG-8 facilitates proper spindle organization was not explored. Here, we show that ZYG-8 is required for both the assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle. Further, we demonstrate that ZYG-8’s kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis, and we reveal important roles for this protein in modulating both microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the oocyte spindle. Together, this work reveals new functions for ZYG-8 during meiosis and sheds light on how the proper structure of the oocyte spindle is achieved and maintained. 
 To begin investigating the function of C. elegans ZYG-8 in acentrosomal spindle assembly, we utilized two different zyg-8 temperature sensitive mutant strains, one with a mutation within the microtubule-binding Doublecortin domain, zyg-8 ( or484 ), and the other with a mutation within the kinase domain, zyg-8 ( b235 ) ( Figs 1A and S1A ). These mutants have been previously characterized and both display mitotic defects at the restrictive temperature of 25°C [22, 23]. Following incubation of these strains at this temperature, we found that oocyte spindles displayed various morphological defects ( Figs 1B–1E and S1B–S1E ) ; these defects were observed in both Meiosis I and Meiosis II ( Fig 1B ), so all quantifications represent a mix of these two stages. First, staining with the microtubule minus end marker ASPM-1 revealed pole defects; while spindles at the permissive temperature had two ASPM-1 clusters, an increased number of spindles at the restrictive temperature had 3 or more clusters, reflecting that the spindles were multipolar and/or had fragmented poles ( 18/48 or484 spindles and 24/62 b235 spindles; Figs 1E and S1E ). Spindles at 25°C were also longer than control spindles ( Figs 1C and S1C ), and many spindles appeared to be bent. To quantify this phenotype, we used ASPM-1 staining to define the center point of each pole. We then drew lines connecting each pole to the middle of the spindle, defined by the center of the DNA staining, and measured the angle between the two poles ( Fig 1B schematic ) ; a perfectly straight spindle would therefore measure 180 degrees. Using this measurement, we found that spindles at the restrictive temperature were on average significantly more bent than at the permissive temperature ( Figs 1D and S1D ). In addition to these morphological defects, spind at the restrictive temperature were also defective in their ability to segregate chromosomes ( Figs 1F and 1G ). To determine if these defects were due to Z-8’s role in spindle assembly or stability, we depleted Z- from pre-formed spind using RNAi ( Figs 2 and S2 ). RNAi depletion of Z- from pre-formed spind caused microtules in the center of the spindle to splay and poles to split ( Figs 2 and S2 ). This suggests that Z- is required for the stability of the spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle stability was due to its kinase activity, we used a kinase-dead z- mutant ( Figs 3 and S3 ). RNAi of the kinase-de z from pre-formed spind did not cause microtules to splay (igs 3 and S3 ), indicating that Z’s kinase activity is required for its role in spindle stability. To investigate Z’s role in spindle assembly, we depleted Z from oocytes prior to spindle formation using RNAi (igs 4 and S4 ). RNA depletion of Z prior to spindle formation resulted in spind that were elongated and multipolar (igs 4 and S4 ). To determine if Z’s role in spindle assembly was due to its kinase activity, we used the kinase-de z mutant (igs 4 and S ). RNA of the kinase-de z prior to spindle formation did not result in elongated spind (igs 4 and S ), indicating that Z’s kinase is required for spindle assembly. To determine if Z’s role in spindle assembly was due to its interaction with microtules, we used the microtule-binding mutant z-484 (igs 4 and S ). RNA of z-484 prior to spindle did not result in elongated spind (igs 4 S ), indicating that Z’s interaction with microt is not required for spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle was due to its interaction with the motor BM-1/kines-5, we used the BM-1 mutant (igs 4 and S ). RNA of BM-1 prior to spindle did not result in elongated spind (igs 4 ) indicating that Z’s interaction with BM-1 is not required for spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle was due to its interaction with dyin, we used the dy mutant (igs 4 and S ) RNA of dy prior did not result in elong spind (igs 4 ) indicating that Z’s interaction with dy is not required for spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle was due to its interaction with the motor KLP-18/kines-12, we used the KLP-18 mutant (igs 4 and S ) RNA of K-18 prior did not result in elong spind (igs 4 ) indicating that Z’s interaction with K-18 is not required spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle was due its interaction with the microtule polymerase Z-9, we used the Z-9 mutant (igs 4 and S ) RNA Z-9 prior did not result in elong sp (igs 4 ) indicating that Z’s interaction with Z- is not required spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle was due its interaction with the microt depolymerase MCA, we used the MCA mutant (igs 4 and S ) RNA MCA prior did not result in elong sp (igs 4 ) indicating that Z’s interaction M is not required spindle. To determine if Z’s role in spindle was due its interaction with the microt severing enzyme katan, we used the katin mutant (igs 4 and S ) RNA katin did not result in sp (igs 4 ) indicating Z’s interaction with k is not required

    Title: 
    Article: Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids ( HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL ) and lipoproteins. By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses, we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Secondly, using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis, we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, through differential level analyses, we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Of the 165 metabolites, 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications. 
 Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a common, complex disease, with a prevalence that is expected to increase dramatically, and for which the genetics has been largely described through genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis efforts [1–3]. The next step towards translating these associations into the clinic is to understand the biological mechanisms behind them. To this end, multi-omics data such as metabolite levels offer great promise, as they enable the study of molecular phenotypes closely implicated in the disease. A large number of metabolites have been associated with T2D, as highlighted in a recent study from Julkunen et al. [4], which described 230 metabolites as nominally associated with incident and prevalent T2D. Consistent associations between T2D risk and metabolites across studies mostly cover increases in various amino acid levels, especially branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) [5–7], and dyslipidemia [4, 8]. However, the predictive value of metabolite profiles in T2D risk is still debated. Improved prediction of various complex traits using metabolite profiles over genetic scores has been shown[9], but this improvement is rather limited when compared to classical risk factors including age, sex and family history of disease [10, 11]. The limited prediction of metabolite profiles may be related to the uncertain causal role in modulating T2D risk, a question investigated using Mendelian randomization ( MR ) [12]. One particular example is BCAAs, for which some studies have described a causal effect of valine, leucine and/or isoleucine on T2D [13–15], while more recent evidence has shown no causal effect of BCAAs on T2D risk in the UK Biobank ( UKBB ) cohort [16]. Conversely, increasing evidence of a causal effect of T2D liability on metabolite profiles has been shown, with increased alanine levels caused by increased T2D liability being consistently reported [13, 17, 18]. Conflicting conclusions exist for other metabolites, and little is known about the role of genetic regulation in shaping these relationships. The genetic regulation of metabolite profiles is increasingly described, for example through the latest meta-analysis reporting over 400 independent loci associated with 233 metabolite levels [19]. These metabolite QTLs, also called mQTLs, are usually reported in the general population, and studies are starting to emerge on how they are modified by factors such as diet [20]. However, no study to date has investigated the question of whether the genetic regulation of metabolite levels is affected by the occurrence of T2D. A large part of the healthcare burden associated with T2D is due to subsequent complications of the disease. T2D complications span both microvascular complications, which refer to complications involving small vessels and have an estimated prevalence of 53%, and macrovascular complications which refer to complications involving large vessels such as arteries and veins with an estimated prevalence of 27% [21]. Increasing evidence is emerging that metabolite profiles are also associated with the risk of developing complications, such as the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway with retinal and renal complications [22], two of the main microvascular complications of T2D, n-3 fatty acids with T2D macrovascular complications [23], or amino acids with both types of T2D complications [24]. However, replication of these associations is still needed, as well as investigating whether the metabolites associated with T2D complications are distinct from the ones causally affected by T2D liability. Exploring the links between metabolite levels and T2D can help us gain insights into how these relationships may influence trajectories towards T2D complications, for which underlying biological mechanisms are still to be unraveled. Here, we aim to address these questions and elucidate the metabolic consequences of T2D by investigating the links between metabolite profiles, genetics, and the risk of T2D and subsequent complications. For this, we considered profiles of 249 metabolites from the UKBB cohort [25] assessed through the Nightingale panel, mostly composed of lipids and lipoproteins classes ( around 92% of metabolites ), and covering additional classes such as amino acids ( 10 metabolites ), ketone bodies ( 4 metabolites ), glycolysis-related metabolites ( 4 metabolites ), and markers of inflammation ( 1 metabolite ). These levels were characterized for almost 275, 000 participants through two releases, which were here considered for discovery ( n = 117, 967 individuals ) and replication ( n = 156, 385 individuals ), or meta-analyzed when statistically appropriate. We first performed a bi-directional two sample MR analysis, using non-overlapping datasets for the SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations to limit potential bias [12]. Previous MR studies performed in the UKBB cohort have used only the first release of data for the 249 metabolites and were either limited to a few metabolites, or only investigated a single causal direction [16, 18, 26]. Secondly, we performed an interaction mQTL analysis to assess whether there is a different genetic regulation of metabolite levels between T2D patients and controls. Finally, we investigated how metabolite profiles are associated with T2D complications, and whether these associated metabolites overlap with the metabolites causally affected by T2D liability. 
 Individual level data analysis in the Estonian Biobank was carried out under ethical approval [nr 1. 1-12/3337] from the Estonian Committee on Bioethics and Human Research ( Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs ), using data according to release application [nr 6-7/GI/15486 T17] from the Estonian Biobank. Genetic data from genotyping arrays and imputation are available for over 500, 000 participants in the UKBB cohort. Quality control ( QC ) was performed at the variant level and at the sample ( S1 Appendix ). We selected only variants with a minor allele frequency greater than 1% and with an imputation INFO score greater than 0. 8. To minimize potential bias in MR due to differences between the exposure and outcome datasets which could be related to having different ancestry background in the two datasets, we chose to focus on unrelated individuals of European ancestry. In total, 408, 194 individuals and 9, 572, 578 variants remained after QC. A total of 249 metabolite levels obtained from the Nightingale platform using nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy is available in the UKBB cohort as part of two different releases covering a total of 274, 352 individuals: 117, 967 in the first release, and 156, 385 in the second release. Absolute concentrations cover 168 metabolites, with an additional set of 81 metabolite ratios and percentages, which are further derived from the absolute concentrations ( https://biobank. ndph. ox. ac. uk/showcase/refer. cgi? id=1682 ). To perform metabolite QC, we used the ukbnmr R package ( version 1. 5 ) specifically developed to remove technical variations from NMR metabolite measurements in the UKBB [27]. For each release, we considered only metabolite data at the first timepoint, T0, corresponding to a total of 227, 607 individuals and 249 metabolites after applying the ukbnmr QC ( S1 Appendix ). For the MR analysis, we selected metabolites that were present in both releases ( n = 249 ) and had a coefficient of variation ( CV ) less than 0. 2 in both releases ( S Appendix 2 ). This resulted in a final set of 249 metabolites for analysis, of which 92% were lipids and lipoproteins, 10 amino acids, 4 ketone bodies, 4 glycolysis metabolites, and 1 marker of inflammation ( Table 1 ). For the MR analysis, we used large-scale T2 GWAS data from the DIANTE meta-analysis [28], which included over 1,000,000 individuals with T2 cases and 1,000,000 controls. We performed a bi-directional two-sample MR analysis to investigate the causal relationship between metabolites and T2 risk. We used the inverse-variance weighted ( IVW ) method [29] to estimate the causal effect of each metabolite on T2 risk, and the two-stage least-squares (2SLS) method [30] to estimate the effect of T2 on each metabolite. The IVW and 2LS methods were chosen for their robustness in the presence of heteroscedasticity [29, 30]. For the interaction QTL analysis, we used the Estonian Biob dataset to compare metabolite levels between T2 cases and controls. We selected metabolites with a CV less than 0.2 in the Estonianob and present in the UKBB ( n 249 ) for analysis ( S3 ). This resulted in a set of 4 metabolites for interaction analysis ( Table 2 ). Finally, we performed differential analysis to identify metabolites associated with T2 complications, microvascular and macrovascular, and both types of T2 complications. We used logistic regression to identify metabolites associated with each type of complication, adjusting for age, sex and family history of T2 ( S4 ). Of the 165 metabolites associated with T2 complications, 40 were not causally linked to T2 in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications ( Table 5 ). 
This study aimed to elucidate the consequences of type 2 diabetes (T2) on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, ID, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. By integrating data with large T2 GWAS from the DIANTE meta-analysis through Mendelianization analyses, we found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2, all lipid-related except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2, spanning all classes including branched-chain amino acids. Using interaction trait locus (QTL) analysis, we described four metabolites replicated in an independent dataset from Estonian Biob, with genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls. The variants from QTL were significant for the corresponding metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, pointing towards T consequences on genetic regulation. Through differential analyses, we found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T2 complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of 165 metabol, 40 were not causally linked T in either, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to occurrence. Overall, this work provides a map of consequences T on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling better understanding of T trajectory to complications.

    Title: 
    Article: Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections, ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. In previous work, we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection ( MRSA, USA300 ), while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 55% and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. In this QTL, the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region. C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival. 
 Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a gram-positive coccus well-adapted to humans and a variety of companion, farm, and wild animals [1]. S. aureus is a commensal organism as well as an opportunist that can cause severe morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. Globally, S. aureus is one of the leading causes of bacterial-related hospitalizations and is responsible for more than one million deaths annually [4]. S. aureus is a growing cause of concern because it spreads easily, and many isolates are resistant to several classes of antibiotics [5, 6]. Nasal carriage of S. aureus varies widely across the human population [7, 8]. Not all colonized individuals develop infections, but colonization is a risk factor for skin and soft tissue infections [9, 10]. These superficial infections are precursors for 50% of S. aureus bacteremia ( SAB ) [11], and approximately one-third of SAB cases lead to sepsis [12, 13]. This variability in disease outcomes after S. aureus colonization, suggests that this host-pathogen interaction may depend on both bacterial and host genetics. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is defined as maintaining health by limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of infection despite a high pathogen burden [14]. Mechanisms underlying tolerance to infection have recently been described for parasitic [15, 16] and viral infections [17]. However, mechanisms underlying tolerance to bacterial infections are poorly understood [18]. The Collaborative Cross ( CC ) is a large panel of genetically diverse recombinant mouse strains derived from eight founder strains ( five classical inbred strains—A/J, C57BL/6J ( BL6 ), 129S1/SvlmJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, and three wild-derived strains—CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ ). This collection captures approximately 90% of the genetic diversity in laboratory mice [19–21]. With fully sequenced genomes, CC strains are ideal candidates for Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) mapping [22, 23]. Crosses between CC strains have been successful in identifying genetic loci underlying susceptibility to seizure [24], and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25], and Salmonella Typhimurium [26] infections. Host genetic variation plays role in sensitivity, tolerance and resistance mechanisms [27–30]. We created a large F2 intercross panel by crossing collaborative cross ( CC ) strains with known phenotypes with respect to MRSA USA300 infection, using a MRSA susceptible strain ( CC061 ) and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ). In our previous work we determined that parental CC061 mice rapidly lost weight and met our euthanasia criteria, while CC024 mice lost less weight and survived the study period [31]. Cytokine and gene expression patterns differed between these strains both before and after infection. In this work we demonstrate that survival in F1 and F2 generation followed a complex dominant pattern of inheritance for the CC024 phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in the parental strains, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a QTL peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. Several genes located in this QTL region suggest a mechanism for tolerance to MRSA infection. 
 In our previous study, two CC strains, CC061 and CC024, were infected with MRSA USA300 and monitored for a week after infection [31]. All of the CC061 mice met our euthanasia criteria with a median survival of three days and were classified as susceptible ( Fig 1A ). All the CC024 mice survived until day 7 with high organ colonization and were classified as tolerant ( Fig 1A and 1B ). CC061 mice lost 18% of their body weight on average ( Fig 1C ). Weight loss in CC024 mice was variable, three animals gained weight and three lost weight, a mean of -2. 5% of body weight was lost across CC024 mice ( Fig 1C ). Kidney, heart, and lung colonization did not significantly differ between CC061 and CC024 ( Fig 1B ). Spleen and liver colonization were higher in CC061 than in CC024 mice, yet there was no difference in tissue damage scores in these two strains for the spleen and liver ( Fig 1D ). Paradoxically, we observed more severe damage in the kidney in tolerant CC024 mice than in sensitive CC061 mice ( Fig 1D ). This finding contradicts the previous dogma that the ability to reduce tissue damage may be a feature of the tolerance phenotype [32, 33]. Each CC strain has a unique immune profile [34, 35], so we examined the differences in immune parameters between CC024 and CC061. CC024 mice have higher baseline circulating white blood cells ( WBC ) before infection than CC061 mice, driven by higher numbers of lymphocytes ( LYM ) ( Fig 2A ). After infection, both WBC ( P = 0. 51 ) and LYM were elevated in CC024 mice compared to CC061 mice ( Fig 2A ), but the change from baseline levels was similar in both lines ( Fig 2B ). After accounting for strain differences in baseline levels of these cytokines, seven cytokines differ significantly between CC024 mice and CC061 mice post-infection. IL-10 was significantly increased in CC061 mice after MRSA infection ( Fig 2C ), while IL-1β, IL-4, IL-9, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-27 were significantly increased in CC024 mice after infection ( Fig 2C, 2D and 2E ). These differences in immune parameters suggest that the two strains differ in their immune response after infection. To understand the genetic components involved in tolerance after infection, we created an F1 population by crossing MRSA susceptible CC061 mice with MRSA tolerant CC024 mice. We infected 14 animals from the F1 generation and compared their phenotypes with those of their parents. The median survival for the F1 generation was seven days, similar to CC024 mice and significantly higher than CC061 mice ( Fig 3A ). F1 mice maintained their weight more similar to the CC024 parent, most losing less weight than the CC061 parent ( Fig 3B ). These data support a complex dominant inheritance pattern for survival in the F1 cross between CC061 and CC024 mice. Survival after MRSA infection has a genetic component and is likely linked to dominant alleles in CC024. F1 mice were bred together to generate a large panel of F2 mice to further investigate the genetic components of tolerance and susceptibility. We infected 316 F2 mice with MRSA USA300. Among the 316 mice, 175 ( 55% ) survived the 7-day study period, while the other 141 ( 45% ) met our euthanasia criteria prior to day 7. Pre-infection weight ( R = 0. 04 ) and infection dose ( R = 0. 05 ) did not correlate with survival ( S1A Fig ). In the F2 population, weight change after infection ( R = 0. 67 ) and kidney colonization ( R = -0. 57 ) correlated significantly with survival ( S1A Fig ). Survival in the F2 population was not influenced by sex ( S1B Fig ). Weight change ( P = 0. 31 ) and kidney colonization ( P = 0 0.05 ) did not correlate with survival in the F population (SB Fig. We identified a QTL peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight after infection in the F2 population ( Fig 2A and 2B ). The QTL on chromosome 7 is associated with the W/EJ ( W ) allele present in CC024 mice, which contributed to their tolerant phenotype. The QTL on chromosome 7 contains two genes C5 and C5, which have high-impact variants in this region. C5 and C5 are receptors for the complement C5a anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors. We hypothesize that C5 may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing the damage caused by cytokine storm resulting in the ability to tolerate higher pathogen burden and longer survival.

    Title: 
    Article: The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles. Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability. However, the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown. Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. In this study, we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. Using forward-time genetic simulations, we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential. We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects. 
 The leading theory of adaptive walks was developed by Gillespie and Orr [12–14]. Under this theory, adaptive walks are characterized by a sequence of mutations with diminishing effect sizes. A key prediction of the Gillespie-Orr model is that the fitness effects of beneficial mutations sampled during adaptation form a negative exponential distribution [14, 15]. This shape emerges as populations approach the optimum phenotype: large effect mutations become progressively disadvantageous due to the increased risk of “overshooting” the optimum. Gillespie recognized that extreme-value theory—a statistical branch focused on sampling from extreme tails of distributions—could be integrated into the genetic theory of adaptation to study the DFE. To understand this connection, consider the distribution of fitnesses among all genotypes. Under normal circumstances, the wild-type genotype should have relatively high fitness, and hence it belongs to the right tail of this distribution. The remainder of the right tail of the DFE consists of beneficial mutations. Extreme value theory predicts that this right tail can be described by a family of distributions termed the extreme value distribution ( EVD ). Gillespie posited that adaptive steps are samples from the EVD [13]. Studying the shape of the EVD highlights the availability of beneficial mutations to a population and which effect sizes are likely to contribute to adaptation. The EVD can be broadly categorized into one of three “domains of attraction”, or shapes: the Gumbel, Weibull, or Fréchet family of distributions ( Fig 1; [16–18] ). Gillespie argued that the Gumbel is most likely to represent empirical DFEs as it captures common distributions such as the normal, gamma, and log-normal [12, 13]. The Gillespie-Orr exponential expectation outlined above assumes a Gumbel domain [14]. Mutagenesis studies and spontaneous mutation experiments largely support this theoretical expectation ( e. g. [14, 19–24] ). However, evidence in favor of alternative domains does exist, suggesting the field is still open to exploration. Adaptive walks with Weibull-distributed DFEs are characterized by fewer large-effect beneficial mutations compared to Gumbel EVDs [25, Fig 1]. Rokyta et al. [16] observed a Weibull distribution in the ID11 ssDNA phage, hinting at an upper limit on the size of beneficial fitness effects. Further, stabilizing selection can generate a Weibull-distributed EVD by limiting the size of beneficial mutations as populations approach the optimum [18]. On the other hand, Fréchet EVDs have more frequent beneficial mutations [25, Fig 1]. Schenk et al. [26] observed a Fréchet EVD in Escherichia coli adapting to antibiotics. Although it is unclear as to which conditions cause Fréchet EVDs to arise, environments which invoke strong selective pressures on populations are associated with their appearance [26–29]. There are a large number of factors which can influence the DFE among beneficial mutations and these can produce non-Gumbel EVDs. Some of these factors are environmental, such as stabilizing selection driving Weibull EVDs [18]. However, developmental and selective constraints also contribute to the shape of the DFE, implicating the structure of the genotype-phenotype-fitness ( GPW ) map in the DFE’s shape [30–32]. The genotype-phenotype-fitness ( GPW ) map is composed of two distinct components: the genotype-phenotype and the phenotype-fitness relationships. The genotype-phenotype ( GP ) map describes how developmental and physiological processes translate genotypes into phenotypes, while the phenotype-fitness map describes how ecological and selection regimes create fitness differences between phenotypes. For example, stabilizing selection favors intermediate phenotypes, while directional selection favors extreme phenotypes in one direction [33]. The phenotype-fitness map, along with the related genotype-fitness map, has been extensively studied in quantitative and population genetics ( e. g. [34–38] ). Because the GP map is notoriously challenging to estimate, many quantitative genetics models assume an additive relationship between genotype and phenotype [39, 40]. These models derive from Fisher’s [41] infinitesimal model, which supposes that continuous trait distributions can be produced by loci under Mendelian segregation as long as those loci are a ) many, and b ) have small, additive effects on the phenotype [41]. This model is the basis of modern quantitative genetics, providing a simple GP map that requires no information about the underlying genetic systems that describe the developmental and physiological underpinnings of traits [39, 42]. Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that non-additive gene interactions ( epistasis ) are ubiquitous in nature [43–45] and play a crucial role in adaptation [46–49]. Additive models, including the infinitesimal, often fail to capture these gene interactions, and when identified, it is unclear how they represent biological gene action [50]. Hence, it is unknown how functional epistasis might contribute to the developmental constraints that limit evolution [44]. Integrating information about the underlying systems describing trait development enables us to capture genetic interactions affecting fitness. Modeling the molecular networks underpinning trait development and expression can help us understand how gene interactions and regulatory processes shape the survival and reproductive success of organisms, and provide a mechanistic view of how variation arises in natural populations. As we delve deeper into the nature of the genotype-phenotype-fitness landscape, it becomes important to re-evaluate our foundational quantitative genetic models in light of our current understanding of the molecular basis of traits. For instance, how does the distribution of fitness effects change when non-additive GP maps are considered? Does this affect a population’s chance to adapt to a changing environment? To address these questions, we consider a simple gene regulatory network motif to motivate our approach and implement a nonlinear GP map into adaptive walk theory. At the foundation of any trait lies a complex network of interacting genes and regulatory elements which control the expression of proteins [51]. Systems biologists employ mathematical networks known as gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) to model such systems [52]. Empirical networks harbor startling complexity: for example, consider the circadian clock network in Arabidopsis thaliana. This network is driven by a number of interacting network motifs: small, common subnetworks with particular effects on gene expression. For instance, a feed-forward loop motif in this network generates pulses of expression in PRR9/7 [53]. In addition, a negative feedback loop ( another motif ) between CCA1/LHY and PRR5/TOC1 generates a bistable switch [53]. This switch is toggled at daybreak by the aforementioned PRR9/7 feed-forward loop and again at dusk by yet another circuit [53]. Given the complexity of many GRNs, it is common to study motifs as separate units to elucidate the reasons for their repeated recruitment into so many systems [54–56]. This allows systems biologists to probe the general effects of motifs on a broad range of networks. In this study, we focus on the simplest network motif, negative autoregulation ( NAR; Fig 2 ). This motif consists of two genes: gene X activates gene Z ( indicated by the pointed arrow in Fig 2A ), while Z’s product limits its further expression ( indicated by the flat arrow in Fig 2A ). NAR motifs are highly prevalent in biological networks. Close to half of all transcription factors in E. coli are negatively autoregulated [57, 58]. In plants, expression of the oil biosynthesis transcription factor WRINKLED1 ( WRI1 ) is driven via a NAR network that has been evolutionarily conserved from at least the split between monocotyledons and dicotyledons ( about 140 million years ) [59, 60]. The ubiquity of the NAR motif in nature comes as a result of its self-balancing property: when a gene is overexpressed, the NAR mechanism triggers to reduce that gene’s production, leading to a steady state of gene expression [52]. This reduces variability in gene expression between cells and accelerates responses to environmental cues [61, 62]. Owing to its simplicity and ubiquity, we consider the NAR motif a reasonable toy model for beginning to explore the evolution of complex traits mediated by genetic networks. How might we expect networks to affect adaptation? Genetic networks impose functional epistasis on phenotypic variance [63, 64], which in turn affect the distribution of fitness effects of beneficial mutations [65, 66]. In the NAR motif, gene Z’s autoregulation limits the effect of X’s product on the phenotype ( Fig 2B ). This limits the size of beneficial mutations that can contribute to adaptation [67]. As a result, we expect the distribution of fitness effects in the NAR model to differ from the Gillespie-Orr expectation of an exponential distribution [14, 15]. To test this, we use forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both the N and additive models. We find that the N model harbors a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among mutations with a considerable density at deleterious coefficients. This is reminiscent of the cost of complexity where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that interactions from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness. The N model also has fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected by the Gillespie-O model. The distribution of fitness in the N model is consistent with the Weull domain of the EVD, which is characterized by fewer large-effect beneficial mutations [25, Fig 1]. This is consistent with stabilizing selection limiting the size of beneficial mutations as populations approach the optimum [18]. In contrast, the additive model has an exponential distribution of fitness as expected by the Gillespie-O model [14, 15]. The difference between the two models highlights the impact of the N motif on the distribution of fitness effects of mutations. The N motif limits the size of beneficial mutations that can contribute to adaptation, leading to a bimodal distribution of fitness in the N model. In contrast, the additive model has an exponential distribution of fitness as expected by the Gillespie model. The difference between the two models highlights the impact of the motif on the distribution of fitness of mutations. The N motif limits the size of beneficial that can contribute to adaptation leading to a bim distribution in the model. In contrast, the model has an exponential fitness as expected by the model. The difference between the two highlights the impact of the on the distribution of mutations. The motif the size beneficial can contribute adaptation leading to bim in the model.

    Title: 
    Article: A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory, the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear. We propose a novel, Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations. Furthermore, we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity. 
 Successful actions are based on information gathered from a variety of sources. This holds as true for individuals as it does for whole societies. For instance, experts, political parties, and special interest groups may all have different opinions on proposed legislature. How should one combine these different views? One might, for example, weight them according to their relative reliability, estimated from demonstrated expertise. According to Bayesian probability theory, the combined reliability-weighted view contains more information than any of the individual views taken on its own and thus provides an improved basis for subsequent actions [1]. Such problems of weighting and combining information from different sources are commonplace for our brains. Whether inputs from neurons with different receptive fields or inputs from different modalities ( Fig 1a ), our cortex needs to combine these uncertain information sources into a coherent basis that enables informed actions. Bayesian probability theory provides clear recipes for how to optimally solve such problems, but so far the implementation in the biological substrate is unclear. Previous work has demonstrated that multiple interacting neuronal populations can efficiently perform such probabilistic computations [3, 4]. These studies provided mechanistic models potentially underlying the often Bayes-optimal behavior observed in humans and other animals [2, 5, 6]. Here we demonstrate that probabilistic computations may be even deeper ingrained in our biological substrate, in single cortical neurons. We suggest that each dendritic compartment, here interpreted as logical subdivision of a complex morphology, represents either a ( Gaussian ) likelihood function or a ( Gaussian ) prior distribution over somatic potentials. These are parametrized by the local effective reversal potential and the membrane conductance. Basal dendrites receiving bottom-up input represent likelihoods, while apical dendrites receiving top-down input, represent priors. We show that the natural dynamics of leaky integrator models compute the corresponding posterior. The crucial ingredient is the divisive normalization of compartmental membrane potentials naturally performed in the presence of conductance-based synaptic coupling [7]. Furthermore, while this computation relies on bidirectional coupling between neuronal compartments, at the level of the neuronal input-output transfer function, the effective computation can be described in a feed-forward manner. Beyond performing inference, the single-neuron view of reliability-weighted integration provides an efficient basis for learning. In our approach, synapses not only learn to reproduce a somatic target activity [8], but they also adjust synaptic weights to achieve some target variance in the somatic potential. Furthermore, afferents with low reliability will be adjusted to contribute with a smaller total excitatory and inhibitory conductance to allow other projections to gain more influence. Implicitly, this allows each dendritic compartment to adjust its relative reliability according to its past success in contributing to matching desired somatic distributions. In our theoretical framework we derive somatic membrane potential dynamics and synaptic plasticity jointly via stochastic gradient ascent on the log-posterior distribution of somatic potentials. Simulations demonstrate successful learning of a prototypical multisensory integration task. The trained model allows us to interpret behavioral and neuronal data from cue integration experiments through a Bayesian lens and to make specific predictions about both system behavior and single cell dynamics. 
 To give a high-level intuition for our approach, let us consider a prototypical task our brains have to solve: the integration of various cues about a stimulus, for example in early visual areas from different parts of the visual field ( Fig 1a ) or in association areas from different sensory modalities ( Fig 1b ). Due to properties of the stimulus and of our sensory systems, information delivered via various modalities inherently differs in reliability. Behavioral evidence demonstrates that humans and non-human animals are able to integrate sensory input from different modalities [2, 5, 6, 9–14] and prior experience ( e. g., [15, 16] ), to achieve a similar performance as Bayes-optimal cue-integration models. Our theory suggests that pyramidal cells are naturally suited to implement the necessary computations. In particular they take both their inputs and their respective reliabilities into account by using two orthogonal information channels: membrane potentials and conductances. Consider a situation where your visual sensory apparatus is impaired, for example, due to a deformation of the lens. Presented with multimodal stimuli that provide auditory and visual cues, you would have learned to rely more on auditory cues rather than visual input ( Fig 2 ). When confronted with an animal as in Fig 2a, based on your vision alone, you might expect it to be a cat, but not be certain about it. Hearing it bark, however, would shift your belief towards it being, with high certainty, a dog. Since current-based neuron models only encode information about their preferred feature in the total synaptic current without considering the relative reliability of different pathways, they can generate wrong decisions: here, a neuron that integrates auditory and visual cues wrongly signals the presence of a cat to higher cortical areas ( Fig 2b ). In contrast, as we will show in the next section, by using dendritic conductances gd as an additional coding dimension besides effective dendritic reversal potentials Ed, conductance-based neuron models are able to respond correctly by weighting auditory inputs stronger than visual inputs ( Fig 2c ). Intuitively, in the absence of stimuli, the “cat neuron” ( Fig 2b and 2c ) represents a small ( prior ) probability that a cat may be present, and the presentation of an ambiguous cat-dog image increases this probability ( Fig 2e, 400–1200ms, d, e ). However, when the animal subsequently barks, the probability drops abruptly. In our approach these computations are reflected by a hyperpolarization of the somatic membrane potential and an associated increase in membrane conductance. Consistent with Bayes-optimal cue-integration models ( e. g., [17] ), the combined estimate shows an increased reliability, even if the cues are opposing. Excitatory and inhibitory conductances targeting a single microscopic neuronal compartment ( with at most one excitatory and one inhibitory afferent ) combine with the leak and the associated reversal potentials into a total transmembrane current Id = gd ( Ed − ud ). This current induces a stimulus-dependent effective reversal potential Ed given by E d = g E E E + g I E I + g L E L g E + g I + g L, ( 1 ) where excitatory, inhibitory and leak reversal potential are denoted as EE/I/L, and the respective conductances by gE/I/L. The sum of these three conductances gd = gE + gI + gL represents the local membrane conductance, which excludes the coupling to other compartments. The excitatory and inhibitory conductances are the product of the synaptic weights times the presynaptic firing rates, gE/I = WE/Ir. Note that in general Ed is different from the actual dendritic potential ud, which is additionally influenced by the membrane potential in neighboring compartments. Across the dendritic tree ( with multiple compartments i ) we now interpret g i d and E i d as parameters of Gaussian [18] likelihood functions p ( E i d | u s, g i d ) in basal compartments and parameters of Gaussian priors p ( u s | E i d, g i d ) in apical compartments. The dendritic likelihoods quantify the statistical relationship between dendritic and somatic potentials. Intuitively speaking, they describe how compatible a certain somatic potential us is with an effective reversal potential E i d. Note that this relation is of purely statistical, not causal nature—biophysically, effective reversal potentials E i d cause somatic potentials, not the other way around. Finally, the somatic compartment computes the posterior according to Bayes theorem ( see Methods Sec. “Bayesian theory of somatic potential dynamics” for details ), p ( u s | W, r ) ∝ likelihood × prior = e - g ¯ s 2 λ e ( u s - E ¯ s ) 2. ( 2 ) Here, g ¯ s represents the total somatic conductance, and E ¯ s the total somatic reversal potential, which is given by the convex combination of the somatic and dendritic effective reversal potentials, weighted by their respective membrane conductances and dendro-somatic coupling factors ( Fig 3 ). The “exploration parameter” λe relates conductances to membrane potential fluctuations. In general, this parameter depends on neuronal properties, for example, on the amplitude of background inputs and the spatial structure of the cell. It can be determined experimentally by an appropriate measurement of membrane potentials from which both fluctuation-dissipation theorem [19], 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 32, 33, 34 35, 36, 37 38, 39, 40, 41 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 58, 59 60, 61, 62 63, 64, 65 66, 67, 68 69, 70, 71, 72 73, 74 75, 76, 77 78, 79 80, 81, 82 83, 84 85, 86 87, 88 89, 90, 91 92, 93 94, 95 96, 97 98, 99 100, 101 102, 103, 104 105, 106, 107 108, 109, 110 111, 112 113, , 114 115, 116, 117, 118 119, 120, 121 122, 123, 124 125, 126, 127 128,129 130, 131 132, 133, 134 135,136, 137 138, 139, 140 141, 142 143, 144 145, 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371

    Title: 
    Article: Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets. Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights. Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification, we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. On average, we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90% of residues in all proteomes. We classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria. In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as the Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. Additionally, we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. Finally, we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets. 
 Protein domains are independent evolutionary units that convey function and fitness either singly or in concert. The study of domains and their homology is a powerful tool for studying protein function [1–3]. Homologous domains can share function, and the propagation of functional annotation from experimentally characterized proteins and their domains to their homologous yet hypothetical or uncharacterized domains can lead to biological insights [4–7]. Protein domain classifications determine and organize these homologous domains [8] and either 1 ) sequence classifications such as Pfam [9], CDD [10], or SUPERFAMILY [11] that partition protein sequence into domains and derive their taxonomy principally by sequence similarity measures or 2 ) structure classifications such as SCOP [12, 13], CATH [14], or ECOD [15] that use structural similarity to determine more distant homology ( at the cost of access to fewer proteins ). The advent of highly accurate structure prediction software may upset this traditional division. The outstanding performance of DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 at CASP14[16–18] led to the subsequent development of software such as RoseTTAFold [19], ESMFold [20], and I-TASSER-MTD [21] as well as the widespread prediction of large protein sets resulting in resources such as the AlphaFold Structure database ( AFDB ) [22] and ESM-Atlas [23]. AlphaFold is a deep-learning-based structure prediction method trained on data generated by structural biologists and stored by the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) [24]. Since its release in 2020, it has been used to generate and make available numerous data sets through the AlphaFold Structural Database hosted by the EBI, including 48 whole proteomes, numerous curated proteins within the SWISS-PROT dataset, and 200M predictions representing the known protein universe [22]. Two major measures of confidence are made available with each prediction: 1 ) Per-residue predicted local distance difference test ( plDDT ) measures, which can be used to measure prediction confidence and 2 ) predicted aligned errors ( PAE ) which can be used to measure relative pairwise confidence between two residues ( or regions ) within a prediction. These measures can identify disordered and low-confidence regions with proteins that may only be structured in a multimeric context, or that are biologically disordered. These measures can be used as an effective screening tool for models or regions of models towards structurally ordered or globular regions [25]. Extensive analysis of these measures in the predictions of human proteins revealed that ~75% of the human proteome was covered by experimental structures, predicted models, or homology models of existing experimental structures, in addition to 12% of the proteome that is judged to be intrinsically disordered. Only a small fraction ( 2% ) of the proteome was judged to be bona fide domains with unknown structure or very distant homology [26]. These proportions correspond with our observation of ECOD domains in the predicted structure of the human proteome [27]. We use them directly in DPAM for partition and assignment, as well as in our analysis and screening of the resulting domains and regions. For nearly a decade, we have classified domains into our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures using a combination of structural and sequence aligners along with expert curation on selected difficult cases [15, 28]. As opposed to other structural domain classifications, ECOD’s hierarchy is structured to prioritize homology over topology. Although the principal goal of ECOD has been the classification of proteins with experimental structures, we have recently demonstrated the utility of ECOD for domain classification in both eukaryotic [27] and bacterial ( Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD ) proteomes. In both cases, ECOD, combined with a recently developed structural domain parser ( DPAM ) for AlphaFold models [29, 30], classified the available residues into either domains or low-confidence and disordered regions. The resulting domains from these proteomes suggested biological insights for their respective organisms, and they were made available on the ECOD website. The flood of protein predictions after the release of AlphaFold, and the observed domain content relative to unstructured or low-confidence regions, prompted us to examine the behavior of our domain classification more closely on the broadest selection of whole proteomes. Among the available models, there is a breadth of structure quality, arising from multiple potential causes: 1 ) lack of structural context for multimeric complexes 2 ) biological disorder within proteins 3 ) conformation changes, 4 ) genome annotation, and 5 ) error in structure prediction. We suggest that domain classification from these structures, and positively identifying different types of regions within them, is necessary to use these predictions most effectively. Moreover, closely associating domains from predictions with experimental data, where possible, is one way to mitigate possible errors from the structure prediction algorithm. The classification of proteins into domains is one potential strategy for grappling with the size and quality of the data offered by large structure prediction efforts. Previous efforts using a prior version of the AF2 inference model ( v1 ) and a smaller selection of 21 proteomes have found that in a large percentage ( 92% ) of models, these proteomes can be partitioned into domains and assigned to the existing CATH hierarchy [31]. This work also featured manual assignment of difficult-to-assign human domains, as well as classification of domains into closely related sequence families. The division of predicted models into easily classified domains, domains with more distant or difficult-to-recognize homology, or regions that are unstructured or have no domains whatsoever will continue to be a useful strategy for grappling with these large structural datasets. Here we classify the domains from 48 whole proteomes available in the AFDB. These proteomes include a wide selection of model organisms such as zebrafish, fruit flies, and E. coli. They also include numerous organisms that cause diseases such as malaria, leprosy, and bacterial pneumonia. We examine the varying population of homologous groups among predictions from whole proteomes and the experimentally characterized protein universe. We also examine the differing classification between eukaryotes and bacteria in these predicted examples. The widespread access to proteins that were previously difficult or unamenable to structural classification dramatically diminishes the gap between structural and sequence classification. Finally, we illustrate those homologous groups that are enriched by domains and use well-known sequence domain annotations to estimate the degree to which structure prediction of proteins and classification of their domains has expanded our knowledge of previously unknown domains. 
 Domain classification can reveal functional information by identifying homologous relationships between domains. By classifying whole proteomes, we can determine the prevalence of given homologous domain groups within different organisms as well as determine those domains previously unannotated by sequence methods. We classified domains from 48 whole proteomes from AFDB [32] using the DPAM v2 ( Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models ) domain assigner and ECOD develop285 as a reference [28, 30]. These proteomes included 16 notable model organisms such as Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as 32 organisms involved in diseases relevant to global health, such as Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( S1 Table ). In total, we classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. By comparison, the reference version of ECOD ( develop285 ) used for classification contained 898, 379 domains from 599, 852 peptide chains in 179, 294 PDB depositions. These domains and their boundaries have been made available on the ECOD website ( http://prodata. swmed. edu/ecod/index_af2. php ) and have been deposited in a Zenodo repository [33]. DPAM classifies regions of AF2 models using sequence and structural aligners combined with the AF2 predicted aligned errors ( PAE ) to assist with determining globular regions, these regions are then assigned to ECOD using a neural network. In contrast to previous automated methods used to assign domains [34, 35], DPAM does not rely solely on sequence or structure, but combines both to improve accuracy. The use of DP and EC has allowed us to classify 90% of residues in the proteomes into either domains or non-domain regions. The remaining 10% are either disordered or unassigned regions, which may be due to several factors such as 1 ) lack of structural context for multimer complexes 2 ) biological disorder within proteins 3 ) conformation changes 4 ) genome, and 5 error in structure prediction. The classification of these regions is necessary to use predictions effectively, and associating them with experimental data where possible is a way to mitigate errors from structure algorithm. The classification of proteins into domains is a strategy for grappling with the size and quality of data offered by structure efforts. We compared the sampling of homolog groups from whole proteomes against the stable EC reference and found that certain groups have been enriched by predictions. These include Rossm domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains, which are shared between eukotes and bacteria. We also found that eukotes have a higher proportion of disordered regions and unassigned domains, as well as a higher proportion of proteins with globular and small repeats. These findings are consistent with previous studies [27, 36, 37]. We discuss the implications of these results for future classification strategies for large sets of proteins. The study of domains and their homology is a powerful tool for understanding protein function [1–3]. Homolog domains share function and the propagation of functional annotation from experimentally characterized proteins and their domains to their homolog yet uncharacterized can lead to biological insights [4–7]. Domain classifications and organize homolog domains [8] either 1 ) sequence classifications such as Pfam [9, CDD [10, SUPERAMILY11 ] that partition sequence into domains and derive taxonomy by similarity or 2 ) structure such as SCOP [12, CATH14, EC15 that use structural similarity determine distant homology at cost access fewer proteins. The advent of accurate prediction may upset traditional division. The outstanding performance of DeepMind’s Alpha2 CAS14–18 led to development software such as RoseAFold [19, ESM20, IASS-M21 as well as prediction large sets in resources such as AFDB [22 ESM23. Alpha is deep-learning prediction trained on PDB data [24 ] Since release 2020, has generated numerous sets through AF hosted by EBI, including 48 proteomes curated SWISSPROT 200M and predictions universe [22. Two measures confidence are available each prediction 1 ) plT measures confidence 2 PA relative confidence between residues or regions. These can identify disordered low regions that may be structured multimer or biologically dis.

    Title: 
    Article: BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are no antivirals. The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection, promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery. Here, we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that robust TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first. By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication, we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase. BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication. Thus, BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection. Together, these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV. 
 BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a small, double-stranded DNA virus that persistently infects the kidneys of approximately 180% of adults worldwide [1, 2]. Although BKPyV reactivation is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it causes graft loss in kidney transplant patients and is associated with increased risk of bladder cancer [3–5]. Despite the prevalence of BKPyV and the severity of complications, there are currently no specific treatments for BKPyV reactivation [6, 7]. While BKPyV relies on the host replication machinery to replicate the viral DNA, it provides its own helicase, large tumor antigen ( TAg ) [1]. BKPyV replication using TAg and host replication machinery activates a cascade of kinases known as the DNA damage response ( DDR ), which prolongs S phase and is necessary for robust viral replication [8, 9]. Following viral replication, BKPyV expresses the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, which encapsidate newly synthesized genomes to produce infectious virions [1, 10]. While other DNA tumor viruses prevent host DNA replication through DDR activation, BKPyV uses DDR activation to induce and maintain host re-replication [8, 11, 12]. Importantly, the re-replication phenotype of the host DNA is also found in kidney biopsies from transplant patients with uncontrolled BKPyV reactivation, in which enormous, TAg+ nuclei are observed [13]. Given this requirement of host re-replication and the evidence of re-replication in vivo, a mechanistic understanding of how BKPyV induces re-replication is required. Human DNA replication is temporally separated into two steps: origin licensing and origin firing [14]. During origin licensing in M and G1, the hexameric helicase components, MCM2-7, are recruited in a sequence-independent manner to origin recognition complexes ( ORC ) bound to the cellular DNA [14, 15]. MCM licensing is tightly regulated by both transcription and protein degradation to prevent re-licensing of newly synthesized DNA in S phase; ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle. Tight regulation of re-licensing is essential as failure to prevent origin licensing in S phase results in irreparable DNA damage [16, 17]. MCM activation, or firing, requires two kinases, Cdc7 and Cdk2, to recruit Cdc45 and the GINS complex and form the functional DNA helicase [18, 19]. However, it has been shown that both Cdc7 and Cdk2 are inhibited by DDR activation [20, 21]. Therefore, it is unknown how BKPyV induces re-replication without causing increased DNA damage [8], or how the virus blocks mitosis by activating the DDR without also inhibiting Cdc7 and Cdk2 [21]. To understand how BKPyV manages to replicate host DNA despite DDR activation, we used single-cell techniques to characterize the cell cycle during a BKPyV infection of human primary renal kidney epithelial ( RPTE ) cells, which are the site of natural infection in humans. Our analysis of the cell cycle in BKPyV infected RPTE cells revealed that robust expression of TAg was primarily observed in the re-replicating population, which suggested that robust TAg expression depended on an initial host S phase. Indeed, inhibition of host origin licensing or firing prior to re-replication decreased viral titers and prevented TAg expression. Using dual-pulse labeling to track an initial S phase population throughout the cell cycle revealed a rapid accumulation of TAg as cells entered G2, which was followed by VP2/3 expression. Since BKPyV required host replication, we investigated if BKPyV infection caused aberrant host licensing, but found that licensing pathways behaved canonically. Similarly, both host origin firing kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2 were required for efficient re-replication. Together, these data inform a revised BKPyV life cycle, in which BKPyV requires an initial host S phase for robust TAg expression and viral replication during host re-replication. 
 DNA viruses often induce expression of host S phase proteins for viral replication [11]. Importantly, induction of S phase is typically coupled with cell cycle arrest to block concurrent host replication: decreasing competition with the host cell for replication resources. For example, adenoviruses and papillomaviruses arrest cells in G2 by blocking mitosis [22, 23], while herpesviruses arrest cells at the G1/S boundary [24]. BKPyV infection is unusual in that the host DNA is re-replicated and maintained re-replication is required for viral replication [8]. To achieve induction into S phase and subsequent re-replication, the current model for BKPyV infection ( Fig 1A ) supposes early TAg expression first causes S phase entry for viral replication. Since viral replication activates the DNA damage response, mitosis is blocked and the cell undergoes re-replication. Importantly, loss of the re-replicating population drastically reduces viral titers even if the number of initial S phase cells is maintained [8]. To analyze the cell cycle profiles of mock and BKPyV infected RPTEs, we used a combination of 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) pulse labeling and DNA content to generate single-cell cell cycle plots ( Fig 1B ). Cells were fixed and imaged at 24, 36, 48, and 72hpi, which revealed that there was no difference in the cell cycle profile between the mock and BKPyV-infected cells at 24hpi ( Fig 1B and 1C ). Later timepoints, however, showed an increase in S phase in the BKPyV-infected cells, which was largely attributed to an increase in re-replicating cells ( Fig 1B and 1C ) as demonstrated by the significant increase in the DNA content ( mean DNA intensity ) of the S phase cells ( Fig 1D ). Given the small size of the viral genome ( 5. 2Kbp ) relative to the human genome ( >6Gbp ) and the viral genome copy number per cell, viral replication could only account for <1% of the cellular DNA and, therefore, the observed increase in DNA content must be the result of host DNA re-replication [1, 25]. Consistent with what others have observed, TAg expression was higher in the re-replicating cells ( Fig 1E ) [8, 26, 27]. Surprisingly, TAg expression was undetectable in the 2N population by fluorescent microscopy, which was unexpected as TAg expression is thought to be occur early to drive cells into S phase. The single-cell data, however, showed a 100-fold increase in TAg intensity as cells transitioned from the initial S phase to the 4N population ( Fig 1F ), while cells that were not yet in S phase had undetectable TAg levels ( Fig 1E and 1F ). Expression of the late genes revealed that VP2/3 expression followed the robust TAg expression as cells progressed to re-replication ( Fig 1G ), suggesting that infectious virions are formed in re-replicating cells. This agrees with the current model of the BKPyV life cycle, wherein robust expression of TAg precedes expression of the late proteins, but places viral replication after the cell arrived at 4N. Since even at early timepoints, robust TAg expression was consistently observed in ≥4N cells, these data suggest that BKPyV production is dependent on an initial S phase. To determine if viral replication depended on an initial host S phase, we used chemical inhibitors to specifically prevent cellular DNA replication. Although cellular and viral DNA replication use similar replication proteins, BKPyV uses TAg as the viral helicase whereas cellular DNA uses the CMG ( CD45, MCM2-7, GINS ) helicase in a highly regulated, sequential manner [14, 28]. Thus, inhibitors that target the host replication machinery would not affect BKV replication. We used aphidicidicolin ( Aph ) to inhibit the CMG helicase and hydroxyurea ( HUra ) to inhibit Cdc and Cdk, which are essential for origin licensing and firing [29,30]. Treatment of BKV-infected RP cells with either Aph or Hra resulted in a significant decrease in viral titers and TAg expression ( Fig 2A and 2 ), demonstrating that BKV replication and TAg expression rely on host replication. Inhibition of host replication also prevented the increase in DNA content observed in BKV-infected cells ( Fig 2 and 2 ), indicating that host-replication is required for BKV replication. To determine if BKV infection caused aberrant host-relicensing, we analyzed the cell cycle profiles of BKV-infected cells in the presence of Aph or Hra ( Fig 2 and 2 ) and found that hostlicensing behaved canonically. Both origin kinases Cdc and Cdk were required for efficient-relication in BKV-infected cells ( Fig 2 and 2 ), indicating that BKV infection does not disrupt hostlicensing. Together, these data suggest that BKV requires an initial host phase for robust TAg expression and replication during host-replication, and that BKV primarily replicates during host-re. This understanding of the BKV life cycle will inform the development of therapeutic strategies against BKV.

    Title: 
    Article: Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ). While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time, recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones. However, these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Here, we present FABIO, a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome. As a result, FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank. In the real datasets, FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27. 9%-36. 9% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging its improved power, FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits. 
 Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have gained significant popularity in the field of genetics as they are capable of integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) to uncover potentially causal associations between genes and traits [1–3]. However, the traditional approach of conducting marginal TWAS analyses, which examine one gene at a time, has important limitations. In such analyses, the focus is solely on testing the marginal association between genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of a single gene and a trait of interest. This approach overlooks the fact that neighboring genes often exhibit correlated expression levels and share cis-SNPs that are in close linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) with each other [4, 5]. Consequently, genes detected through marginal TWAS may not necessarily be causal but rather represent tag genes in the region. To overcome the limitation of marginal TWAS analysis, several statistical methods for TWAS fine-mapping, including FOCUS ( fine-mapping of causal gene sets ) [4] and FOGS ( Fine-mapping Of Gene Sets ) [6], have been developed [7–9]. These TWAS fine-mapping methods can prioritize associated genes by jointly modeling multiple genes within a specific region of interest. The TWAS fine-mapping methods begin by constructing GReX prediction models using data from eQTL mapping studies [2, 10]. The constructed prediction models are then used to impute GReX in GWAS, enabling the association testing between GReX and the trait of interest at the locus level. Different TWAS fine-mapping methods employ distinct modeling frameworks. Specifically, FOCUS, a Bayesian method, specifies a sparsity-inducing prior on gene effect sizes on the outcome trait and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) for modeling inference. Conversely, FOGS, a frequentist method, relies on a penalty function to model the gene effect sizes on the outcome trait and applies gene set testing for fine-mapping. TWAS fine-mapping analyses have been carried out in many studies, facilitating the discovery of potentially causal gene-trait associations. Despite their widespread usage, current TWAS fine-mapping methods have two important limitations. The first limitation is that these methods were primarily designed to model quantitative traits, which are traits that can be measured on a continuous scale, such as height or blood pressure. When applied to binary disease traits, both FOCUS and FOGS still apply a linear regression framework to model the association between multiple GReX and the binary outcome trait ( S1 Text ), relying on input of marginal GWAS summary statistics generated from either linear regression [11, 12] or logistic regression. Such linear modeling approach of TWAS aligns with the common practice in GWAS association analysis, as a linear regression can be viewed as an effective approximation to logistic regression when effect sizes are small [13]. However, unlike the SNP effect sizes in GWAS, the GReX effect sizes observed in TWAS analysis can be relatively large. Consequently, employing linear regression as an approximation to logistic regression in TWAS fine-mapping settings may not accurately capture the binary nature of the outcome, potentially leading to a loss of power. The second limitation of existing TWAS fine-mapping methods is that they only consider the correlation among GReX within local genomic regions defined by LD blocks. However, cis-SNPs for genes that are outside the same genomic region may still be in LD with each other, resulting in potential correlation among GReX across genomic regions. In addition, correlated gene expression may be observed for pairs of genes located outside local LD blocks, again leading to potential correlation among GReX across genomic regions. Moreover, focusing solely on GReX of genes located within local genomic regions thus may miss causal genes located in other genomic regions that also contribute to the trait of interest [14, 15], potentially leading to unnecessarily increase in residual error variance and subsequent loss of power. Therefore, modeling multiple genes on an entire chromosome may be advantageous in capturing GReX correlations that are not captured by modeling small genomic regions individually, thereby potentially increasing the power of TWAS fine-mapping. Here, we introduce a novel TWAS fine-mapping method called FABIO ( Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes ) that effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. FABIO relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple GReX to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on a chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FABIO through comprehensive simulations. We also applied FABIO to analyze six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank dataset, where FABIO was able to narrow down a small set of causal genes, with the set size 27. 9–36. 9% smaller than those yielded by current TWAS fine-mapping methods. Notably, FABIO prioritized multiple candidate genes previously validated for their association with the respective diseases, such as GATA3 for asthma; ABCG2 for gout; and SH2B3 for hypertension. Putative causal genes identified by FABIO were further validated through enrichment analyses, with disease-associated pathways highlighted in asthma and hypertension. These results support the superior power of FABIO in prioritizing putatively causal genes associated with binary traits. 
 FABIO is described in the Materials and Methods section, with technical details provided in the S1 Text and a method schematic shown in Fig 1. Briefly, FABIO is a TWAS fine-mapping method that aims to identify genes whose GReX is associated with a binary trait of interest. Different from existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches, FABIO explicitly models the binary nature of the outcome trait through a probit model, and simultaneously models all genes on an entire chromosome to account for the GReX correlation both within and between LD blocks, which also reduces the residual error variance to enhance the precision of TWAS fine-mapping. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for model inference, making FABIO scalable to large biobank scale datasets. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and compared it mainly with two existing TWAS fine-mapping methods FOCUS and FOGS. We also compared FABIO with two recently published methods GIFT and cTWAS in the baseline simulation due to their heavy computational demand. The simulation details are provided in the Materials and Methods section. Briefly, we obtained genotype data from 373 individuals in GEUVADIS and 50, 000 individuals in UK Biobank. We focused on 770 genes residing in 50 randomly selected LD blocks on chromosome 1 and obtained cis-SNPs for these genes for simulations. For each gene in turn, we used the genotype data of the cis-SNPs from GEUVADIS to simulate the gene expression level in the gene expression mapping study. We also used the genotype data from the same set of cis-SNPs in UK Biobank to construct the GReX underlying these genes, selected some genes to be causal, and simulated a binary outcome trait of interest in the GWAS. Afterwards, we applied different methods to perform TWAS fine-mapping to identify the causal genes. In the process, we considered a baseline simulation setting and varied one parameter at a time to examine the influence of different parameters on top of the baseline setting. We examined a total of 11 null settings and 15 alternative settings, with 100 simulation replicates per setting. First, we examined the performance of different methods under complete null simulation settings where none of the genes is associated with the outcome trait ( PVE2 = 0% ). We found that FABIO and FOCUS had reasonably low false positive rates under these settings compared to FOGS ( S1A Fig ). For example, under the baseline setting, FABIO falsely identified an average of 0. 5 genes while FOCUS and FOG identified an average of 1.5 and 2 genes respectively. Next, we examined the performance of methods under alternative settings where some genes are associated with the trait ( PVE = 20% ). We found that FIO outperformed FOCUS and FOG in terms of power to detect causal genes. For example, under the baseline, FIO identified an average of 2.5 causal genes while FOCUS and FOG identified an average 1.5 and 2 genes respectively. We also found that FIO outperformed FOCUS and FOG in terms of precision. For example, under baseline FIO had an average precision of 0.8 while FOCUS and FOG had an average of 0.7 and 6 respectively. We also compared FIO with GIFT and cTW under alternative settings. We found that FIO outperformed GIFT and cTW in terms power and precision. For example under baseline FIO had an average power of 0.8 while GIFT and cTW had an average of 0.6 and 7 respectively. We also found that FIO outperformed GIFT c in terms of precision. For example under baselineIO had an average precision of 0.8 while GIFT had an average of 0.7. Finally, we applied FIO to six binary traits in the UKob dataset and compared it with existing TW fine-mapping methods FOCUS and FOG. We found that FIO reduced the size of the causal set by 27.9–36.9% compared to FOCUS and FOG. Notably, FIO prioritized multiple genes previously validated for their association with the respective diseases, such as GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension. These results support the effectiveness of FIO in prioritizing putatively causal genes associated with binary traits. We further validated the putative genes identified by FIO through enrichment analyses with disease-associated pathways in asthma and hypertension. These results support the superior of FIO in prioritizing putatively genes associated with binary traits. In conclusion, FIO is an effective TW fine-mapping method for binary traits that models the binary nature of the outcome through a probit model and jointly models all genes on an entire chromosome to account for GRe correlation both within and between blocks. FIO outperforms existing TW fine-mapping methods in terms of power and precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FIO through simulations and application to six binary traits in the UKob dataset, where FIO reduced the size of the causal set by 27.9–36.9% and prioritized multiple genes previously validated for their association with the respective diseases. Overall, FIO represents an effective tool for TW fine-mapping binary traits.

    Title: 
    Article: Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites. Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined, particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants. We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates. The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance. We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35. [PSI+] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form. Instead, both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity. Taken together, our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation. 
 Proteostasis is maintained by an arsenal of molecular chaperones that are able to detect non-native, misfolded proteins and act upon them to prevent aggregation or to mitigate their toxic consequences [1]. This means that misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade these quality control systems, they form aggregates that are implicated in a number of protein misfolding diseases [2]. More recently, the organized sequestration of misfolded proteins to defined inclusion sites has been recognized as a regulated process that depends on dedicated molecular chaperones, termed sequestrases [3–5]. The sequestration of misfolded proteins into intracellular deposit sites helps cells to cope with an accumulation of misfolded proteins by partitioning them away from their normal productive pathways, protecting against potential cytotoxic effects and by facilitating targeted degradation [6]. Although aggregation is a well-studied phenomenon and many key players are known, it remains unclear exactly how different growth and stress conditions cause protein aggregation and the degree of stress specificity in the chaperone response to aggregate formation is unknown. The spatial sequestration of misfolded proteins is a highly conserved protein quality control ( PQC ) strategy, but the subcellular localization of deposition sites differs between organisms [7–9]. The yeast model is currently the best characterized system relating to stress-induced protein aggregation where extensive genetic and cell biological analyses exist. Proteotoxic stress causes the formation of spatially separated protein deposits including IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ), CytoQ ( cytosolic quality control compartment ) and INQ ( used here to denote both the internuclear quality control compartment and the juxtanuclear quality control compartment, JUNQ ) [5, 9–13]. Following protein misfolding, multiple CytoQs are formed in the cytoplasm, which are resolved into other deposition sites including INQ and IPOD [3, 9, 10]. Cytosolic IPOD, CytoQ and nuclear INQ are thought to represent independent aggregate deposits which protect against overloading the proteostasis machinery during protein misfolding conditions [3]. Proteins targeted to CytoQ and INQ can undergo refolding, whereas terminally misfolded and amyloid aggregates are thought to be targeted to the IPOD [3, 9] Hsp42 and Btn2 are two key sequestrases required for the deposition of misfolded proteins into CytoQ and INQ, respectively [3, 12, 14]. The cytosolic Hsp42 is a member of the small heat-shock family ( sHSP ) of chaperones and contains a prion-like domain ( PrLD ) that is essential for its aggregase function [15]. Like other members of the conserved sHSP family, Hsp42 forms a large homo-oligomeric structure and contains a highly conserved alpha-crystallin domain. Mutations in human sHSPs have been linked to various cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases and hereditary cataracts. Hsp42 has been shown to direct protein sequestration to multiple CytoQs during heat stress conditions using model fluorescently misfolded reporters [3, 12, 14, 15]. The nuclear equivalent Btn2 is a small heat shock-like protein that is essential for INQ formation. Its protein levels are strongly induced by heat stress, and it functions in recruiting Hsp70/Hsp100 disaggregases for refolding of sequestered proteins during stress recovery [3, 14, 16]. Btn2 has been shown to form high-molecular-weight complexes reminiscent of sHsp oligomers and similarly exhibits chaperone activity by associating with misfolded reporter proteins to increase their reactivation by Hsp70-Hsp100 chaperones [16]. Yeast Btn2 has similarity to Hook1, a coiled-coil protein that associates with the cytoskeleton in mammalian cells. Its name derives from the finding that it is upregulated in response to loss of BTN1, which encodes an ortholog of a human Batten disease protein implicated in progressive neurodegeneration and early death. Despite the established roles for Hsp42 and Btn2 as cellular sequestrases, their exact intracellular functions have remained elusive, especially since no growth defects have been observed in deletion mutants including a lack of sensitivity to heat stress [3, 16, 17]. In this current study we have investigated the roles of the Hsp42 and Btn2 protein sequestrases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein misfolding and aggregation [18, 19]. We show that the levels of protein oxidative damage formed in response to oxidative stress are similar in wild-type and sequestrase mutants, but protein aggregation is elevated suggesting that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases normally act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the cells antioxidant defence system. In agreement with this idea, we show that btn2 hsp42 mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress implicating a functional role for protein sequestration in oxidant tolerance. Together, our data show that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases act to protect against widespread amorphous and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative stress conditions. 
 Given the lack of sensitivity of sequestrase mutants to heat stress conditions, we examined whether Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress, as another stress condition that causes protein misfolding and aggregation. For these experiments we used single hsp42 and btn2 mutants as well as a double btn2 hsp42 mutant. We first confirmed that mutants lacking BTN2 or HSP42 are unaffected in temperature sensitivity ( Fig 1A ). Interestingly, the btn2 and hsp42 mutants were modestly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and the double btn2 hsp42 mutant showed strong sensitivity implicating a functional requirement for these chaperones during oxidative stress conditions ( Fig 1A ). Cur1 is the yeast paralog of Btn2 but is not required for INQ formation [14]. We therefore examined the oxidant sensitivity of cur1 and btn2 cur1 mutants but found that loss of CUR1 does not increase oxidant sensitivity ( Fig 1A ). Despite not being required for heat tolerance, Btn2 and Hsp42 protein levels are increased in response to heat stress [3, 14]. Since we found that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required to promote oxidant tolerance, we tested whether their expression levels are also increased in response to oxidative stress conditions. However, no increases in Btn2 or Hsp42 protein levels were observed in response to hydrogen peroxide stress suggesting that the basal levels of these sequestrases are sufficient to promote oxidant tolerance ( Fig 1B ). In comparison, Btn2 and Hsp42 protein levels were increased by 12-fold and 2. 3-fold respectively, in response to a 37°C heat stress ( Fig 1B ). One possibility to explain the oxidant sensitivity of the btn2 hsp42 double mutant is that protein oxidation is increased in sequestrase mutants. We examined protein carbonylation as a commonly used marker of protein oxidative damage [20]. Carbonyl groups on proteins can be detected by immunoblot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the carbonyl-specific probe DNPH. Using this assay, we found that protein carbonylation is elevated by approximately 50% in a wild-type strain in response to hydrogen peroxide ( Fig 2A ). In contrast, carbonylation was increased by 2. 5-fold in btn h42 mutant and 3. 5-fold in btn2 mutant ( Fig 2A ) indicating that protein oxidation is increased in sequease mutants. To test whether oxidation is responsible for the oxidant sensitivity of btn h42 and btn2 mutants, we overexpressed Hsp Hsp104, a chaper that disaggregates oxidized proteins [21]. Overexpression of Hsp104 rescued the oxidant sensitivity of btn h42 and btn2 mutants ( Fig 2 ) suggesting that oxidation is the primary cause of oxidant in these chaper mutants. We next examined the role of Btn2 and Hsp in sequeases in the formation of protein aggregates during oxidative stress. In wild-type cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide, we observed the formation of amorph and amyloid aggregates ( Fig 3 ). In contrast, btn h42 and btn2 mutants showed increased amorph and amyloid aggregates ( Fig 3 ) indicating that Btn and Hsp sequeases act to sequest oxidized proteins during oxidative stress. We also examined the role of Btn and Hsp in the formation of the [PSI] prion, an amyloid form of the Sup35 protein [22, 23]. The [PS] pr is a well-stud prion that forms in response to oxidative stress [24, 25]. We found that btn2 hsp mutants show increased formation of the [PS] pr ( Fig 4 ) whereas overexpression of H104 rescues [PS] pr formation ( Fig 4 ) indicating that Btn and Hsp seases act to suppress [PS pr formation during oxidative stress. The [PS] pr is thought to form in the cytoplasm [24, 25] but we found that [PS] pr formation does not require IPO ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization ( Fig 4 ) which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to their heritable prion form. Instead, both amorph and amyloid Sup35 are increased in btn hsp mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative conditions in the absence of sequease activity ( Fig 4 ) Taken together, our data identify proteinque as a key antioxidant mechanism that functions to mitigate the consequences of protein-induced aggregation during oxidative stress.

    Title: 
    Article: Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes, while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ), transcripts without protein-coding potential, for role in GBM invasion. We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel. Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis. Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments. Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33–83% decrease in invasion ( p<0. 01 ) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, identified from effect size and p-value, demonstrated 82. 7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade ( p<0. 0001 ). RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3, previously implicated in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with lncRNA expression, while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. Finally, WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD. CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, as critical to GBM invasion. Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this novel lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3. 
 Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is the most common and aggressive adult primary malignant brain tumor, with an estimated annual incidence of 17, 000 new cases per year in the USA [1]. Standard of care treatment includes surgical resection, chemotherapy with temozolomide ( TMZ ), and radiation therapy, but despite the available therapeutic options, mean survival remains at about 12 to 15 months and the five-year survival rate at 5. 5% [2–5]. The majority of GBM patients also invariably experience tumor recurrence with increased chemo- and radio-resistance, and there is no standardized second line of management after initial adjuvant treatment. Further evidence suggests that microscopic tumor invasion beyond gross radiographic and intraoperatively visualized tumor specimen contributes to continued tumor growth despite gross total radiographic resection [6–8]. The limited efficacy of treatment options necessitates novel therapeutic strategies and molecular targets that can limit this tumor invasion and subsequent tumor recurrence. While current genetic studies in glioma research have primarily focused on targeting coding genes, about 80% of the genome is composed of non-coding RNAs [9, 10]. Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins but have demonstrated involvement in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation. LncRNAs have been shown to play roles in the pathogenesis of multiple malignancies. Notably, because they exhibit highly cell type-specific expression and function, they have become attractive novel targets of gene therapy [9, 11–18]. To identify novel genetic therapeutic targets in cancer treatment, systematic functional screens have recently been successfully employed to rapidly and efficiently identify transcripts could sensitize cancer cells to treatment. Despite the rapidly emerging use of these functional screens to identify novel genetic targets, few studies have specifically identified novel candidate lncRNAs targeting glioma. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) is a technology that has allowed for genome-wide screens of gene function [19–26]. This technology has been valuable in the identification of both coding and non-coding genes that are involved in various cellular phenotypes. Due to the nature of non-coding RNAs, standard CRISPR knockdown may not effectively limit lncRNA function, as small deletions do not typically reduce lncRNA-induced effects [20, 23, 27]. CRISPRi ( CRISPR interference ) circumvents this challenge, repressing transcription of the lncRNA at the nucleus via fusion of a catalytically inactive Cas9 ( dCas9 ) with a repressive KRAB domain [28]. We have previously successfully utilized these CRISPRi screens to assess in vitro and in vivo GBM proliferation [19, 29]. CRISPRi screens simultaneously repress multiple genetic targets, with each cell receiving specific individual lncRNA repression. These pools of lncRNA cellular perturbation are then selected for those cells displaying a phenotype of interest. Association of the specific lncRNAs knocked down in remaining selected cells then identifies the lncRNAs that are most closely associated with the selected phenotype. Here, we developed a CRISPRi-based invasion screen to identify lncRNAs that affect the in vitro invasive capacity of glioma cells. In this screen of 2, 307 candidate lncRNAs, we sought to identify specific lncRNAs associated with glioma cell invasion. We further assess the clinical association of candidate lncRNAs with tumor grade and patient outcomes while also evaluating potential mechanisms by finding associations of candidate lncRNAs with potential coding genes affecting GBM invasion. 
 To screen for and identify lncRNAs affecting in vitro glioma cell invasion, we utilized an invasion screen with CRISPRi as a tool for gene knockdown. Repression of transcription occurred when CRISPRi recruited the Cas9 protein fused to a KRAB repressor ( dCas9-KRAB ), which is guided and targeted to transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) by single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) [19]. A GBM cell line ( U87 ) was successfully tranduced with a custom plasmid to express dCas9-KRAB ( U87-dCas9-KRAB ) fused to blue fluorescent protein ( U87-dCas9-KRAB-BFP ), and sorted by FACS to a pure population of U87-dCas9-KRAB. Transduced cells were successfullly infected with lentivirus that contained a U87-specific CRISPRi library derived from CRinCL ( Addgene #86542, a gift from Jonathan Weissman ). This library was comprised of sgRNAs targeting 2, 307 lncRNA, with 10 sgRNAs per lncRNA, and 247 negative control sgRNAs, for a total of 23, 564 sgRNAs. U87 cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were infected such that there was 1, 000X coverage per sgRNA, and we selected for infected cells using puromycin ( Fig 1A ). A low infection efficiency ( MOI < 0. 3 ) was utilized to decrease chances of cells being infected by more than one sgRNA. Cells were then seeded in Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers for 24 hours at a density of 5 x 105 cells per chamber, with serum-free medium in the top chamber and 10% fetal bovine serum medium in the bottom chamber as the chemoattractant for 24 hours. At the completion of this invasion period, screen population cells remaining in the top chamber were successfully isolated and collected. DNA was extracted from cells, followed by PCR amplification and isolation of lentivirally incorporated sgRNA screen fragments, prior to analysis by deep sequencing. The process was repeated to attain two independent replicates, which were averaged together for downstream analysis ( S2 Fig ). To determine the lncRNAs with the most notable effects on invasion, screen scores, which were defined as the average phenotype of the top three sgRNAs for a given gene multiplied by the negative log10 ( Mann-Whitney p-value ), were compared to non-targeting controls and plotted on a volcano plot, with the dashed lines representing the threshold to determine screen hits ( Figs 1B and S1 ). These dashed lines were chosen based on threshold cutoffs of prior screens, with the threshold for the y-axis cutoff was -log ( 0. 05 ). This chosen threshold selects lncRNAs with a minimum effect size of greater than approximately 25% at the p-values approach zero ( at the highest y-axis -log[p-value] points ). Our screen score thus incorporates both p-value and effect size, as previously described [19]. In the non-invading cells, 45 gene targets were significantly enriched in the library, which represents genes that are necessary for glioma cell invasion. Positive hits were identified through this process, and the top candidate was identified as LINC03045 ( annotation LH02236 ) on chromosome 10. Another candidate, ZNF215-AS1 ( annotation LH02727 ), was also identified on chromosome 11, but this study will focus on LINC03045 since subsequent investigation demonstrated that it had a stronger phenotype. Preliminary results, including clinical correlations with tumor grade, patient survival, and effects of in vitro knockdown on invasion and growth for ZNF215-AS will be reported elsewhere. LINC45 is a previously unannotated lncRNA on chromosome 10, with a length of 1, 200 nucleotides. LINC45 expression was significantly associated with glioma grade and patient survival (p< 0.0001 ), with 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knockdown (p 0.01 ). LINC45 expression was also correlated with WASF, a gene previously implicated in glioma invasion (p 0.01 ). RNA-seq analysis of LINC45 knockdown revealed that WAS3 was highly correlated with lRNA expression, while WAS3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. WAS overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC45 KD. CRISi screening identified LINC45, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion Gene expression is associated with tumor grade and survival. RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest this novel lRNA may regulate via WAS3. 
The study aimed to identify lRNAs associated with glioblastoma (GBM) invasion using a CRISPR-interference (CRi) screen. A total of 2,307 lncRNAs were screened, and 48 were significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC45, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knockdown and was associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA analysis of LINC knock revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor invasion, was correlated with lRNA expression, while WAS KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. WAS overexpression rescued invasive function lost with LINC KD. CRi screening identified LINC, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion. Gene expression is associated with tumor and survival.

    Title: 
    Article: It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli. An important issue associated with this conjecture is the identification of the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model. 
 It has been proposed that the brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences of stimuli and organises these regularities to be able to classify the stimuli and to make predictions. How the brain proceeds to identify and to classify statistical regularities is still essentially an open question. Proposals on how the brain implements this issue have been suggested. For example, the brain may use Bayesian inference to estimate parameters relevant for the identification of statistical regularities [1–5]. Recently Duarte et al. [6] and Hernández et al. [7] proposed the use of probabilistic context tree models [8, 9] to represent the statistical regularities displayed by stochastic sequences of auditory stimuli. Employing this approach it was possible to extract, from EEG data, the regularities matching the algorithm used to generate the random sequence of stimuli. In [6, 7] the procedure to generate the sequence of auditory stimuli is defined by a context tree and an associated family of transition probabilities used to choose each next stimulus given the context associated to the sequence of past stimuli at each time step. A model selection procedure allowed Duarte et al. [6] and Hernández et al. [7] to retrieve from the EEG signals recorded at the prefrontal cortex the context tree governing the sequence of auditory stimuli. In spite of the interest of all these works, each one of them assumes a particular class of models used by the brain to organise [10] the set of statistical regularities of sequences of stimuli. However, the identification of the class of models actually used by the brain remains an open question. We propose to address this question by using a new clustering procedure for sets of EEG data collected while participants were exposed to sequences of auditory stimuli driven by a context tree. Clustering procedures have the property of retrieving any possible partition of sets of objects. Therefore, using a cluster-based scheme to model data should allow us to select a more parsimonious model of the EEG data in [7]. By identifying natural groupings in data, clustering analysis allows to identify patterns and relationships, with applications in pattern recognition, data compression, biological and medical research and social sciences [11]. There are many procedures to cluster data but there is no one size fits all strategy. The clustering technique depends on the nature and distribution of the data set. In neuroscience, clustering procedures have been applied solve challenges such as categorizing average EEG signals collected in different experimental conditions [12], or finding temporal segmentation in the EEG signals recorded from participants at rest [13]. However, none of them are suitable for clustering sets of functional data. In this paper we present a novel clustering procedure that addresses this problem. This clustering procedure has two stages. The first stage is at the individual level, where sets of segments of the EEG signal per participant are grouped using a new distance between the distribution of sets of functional data inspired by the projective method [14]. In the second stage, to summarize the individual results we employ a consensus clustering procedure. Consensus clustering has been successfully used in neuroscience to obtain accurate, stable and reliable grouping configurations ( for example [15–17] ). For more in depth review of consensus clustering see [18]. In our case, the sequence of stimuli used in the experiment can be characterized by the recurrent occurrence of a strong beat unit. As a matter of fact, in the context tree model employed in [7], the strong beat appears regularly and its appearance is sufficient for the brain to predict the next auditory stimulus. Thus, our conjecture is that the occurrence of the strong beat in the stimuli sequence yields a succinct partition of the underlying structure in EEG data. Our results show that regions of the pre-frontal cortex of the brain effectively use the occurrence of the strong beat to identify the structure embedded in the sequence of stimuli, with a more predominant role of the right hemisphere. Also, this new clustering procedure approach unveils hidden features of the data that could not be retrieved by a context tree [7]. 
 All the participants gave their written consent in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Deolindo Couto Institute of Neurology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( Process Platform Brazil number 22047613. 2. 0000. 5261 ). Nineteen participants were instructed to close their eyes, remain seated and listen carefully to a random sequence of auditory stimuli presented through headphones. The auditory events used as stimuli were strong beats, weak beats, and silent units. The strong and weak beats were recordings of hand claps ( spectral frequency range 0. 2–15 KHz and maximum duration 200 ms each ). The sound files were interrupted at 450 ms with a sharp cutoff. This was done using the software Audacity, version 2. 0. 5. 0 ( https://www. audacityteam. org/ ). The interstimulus interval between two consecutive sound units was always 450 ms. The sequence of auditory events was chosen in a random fashion for each participant, described in the following section. EEG signals were recorded during the presentation of the sequences of auditory events. For more details on the experimental protocol see [7]. Let the elements of the set {0, 1, 2} represent silences, weak beats, and strong beats, respectively. The sequence Xn : n = 0, 1, …, N can be generated symbol by symbol by using the following algorithm. Let V be the set of all participants. For all v ∈ V we start with X 0 v = 2. For each n = 0, ⋯, N − 1, let T n v be the largest t such that t ≤ n and X t v = 2. Then: This process generates stochastic sequences with a “samba-like” rhythm structure. A sample output is ⋯ 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 ⋯ Note that the label 2, that represents the strong beat stimulus, is a recurrent occurrence point; that is, for any n and k with 2 ≤ n ≤ n + k ≤ N, P ( X n : n + k = x n : n + k | X n - 1 = 2, X 0 : n - 2 = x 0 : n - 2 ) = P ( X n : n + k = x n : n + k | X n - 1 = 2 ) ; where Xi:j denotes the subsequence ( Xi, Xi+1, …, Xj ). We used a Geodesic amplifier ( Geodesic HidroCel GSN 128 EGI, Electrical Geodesic Inc. ) coupled with high input impedance amplifier ( 200MΩ, Net Amps, Electrical Geodesics INC., Eugene, OR, USA ). An analogical first order Butterworth band pass filter ( 0. 3-50 Hz ) was applied to the signal and the Cz electrode was used as the reference during data acquisition. The signal was acquired with recording frequency of 500 Hz. In offline processing the data was re-referenced to the average using the EEGLAB package for MATLAB [19] and a fourth order Butterworth band pass filter ( 1-30 Hz ) was applied to the signal. In our analysis we used the electrodes E = {9, 10, 11, 18, 22, 74, 75, 82}, in the standard Geodesic numbering of 128 electrode sets [20]. For each electrode e ∈ E, each participant v ∈ V, and each stimulus sequence index n = 0, 1, …, N, we will denote by Y n e, v the segment from that EEG signal starting 0. 05 sec before the onset of that auditory stimulus and ending at 0. 4 seconds after that onset. Formally assume that, for all e ∈ E, v ∈ V and each n ∈ {1, ⋯, N} we have that Y n e, v ∈ L 2 [ - 0. 05, 0. 4 ]. The baseline of each EEG segment Y n e, v was corrected by subtracting from it the average of the signal in the 50 ms immediately preceding the onset of Xn. For the sake of simplicity, we will not represent the baseline correction in the notation. Furthermore, EEG signals recorded from single electrodes were combined in three subsets E = { E RPF, E LPF, E OCC }, namely: E RPF = { 9, 10, 11 } E LPF = { 11, 18, 22 } E OCC = { 74, 75, 82 }, as corresponding to electrodes in the right prefrontal cortical region ( RPF ), left prefrontal cortical region ( LPF ) and occipital ( OCC ) region. The position in the array geodesic EEG cap is displayed in Fig 1. The electrodes in each subset were combined by taking the average of the signals of the electrodes in the subset. The average was computed as the mean of the signals of the electrodes in the subset. For each e ∈ E, v ∈ V and n ∈ {0, �, N} we will denote the average of Y e, v by Y e, v. For each e ∈ E, v ∈ V and n ∈ {, �, N we will denote the standard deviation of Y e, v by σ e, v. For e ∈ E, v ∈ V and n ∈ {, � N we will denote the variance of Y, by e v by σ 2 e, v. For e ∈ E, v V and n ∈ { �, N we will denote the correlation coefficient of Y, v by ρ e, v. For e ∈ E, V and n ∈ { � N we will the coefficient of variation of Y, v by CV e.

    Title: 
    Article: While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i. e., the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, “cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ”. Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells. Furthermore, we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism. Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs. Furthermore, our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs. 
 Since the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) technologies early this century, this method is becoming one of the essential tools in biomedical fields [1]. While scRNA-seq provides useful information of cellular composition and gene expression at single cell resolution, it has limitations. It is well-known that the total number of RNA molecules per cell, also known as transcriptome-size, varies from-cell-to-cell [2–4]. However, in scRNA-seq analyses, the transcripts are sequenced in individual cells and their transcript-counts are normalized, allowing the comparison of the relative abundance of each transcript-species across individual cells/cell-types [5–9]. This internal normalization process of the analyses cancels out the putative transcriptome size-variations among different cells, concealing potentially important functional differences among the cells. This differential transcriptome-size can be determined by counting the library depth of the cells and/or by including normalizing spike-in RNA in the samples [2, 3, 10, 11]. Alternative, it can be quantified by PCR-based methods [12, 13]. However, these approaches are applicable only to culture cells, blood/immune cells, and cancer cells which are relatively uniform cell types and do not require cell dissociation. In contrast, they are not applicable to solid tissues/organs composed of highly heterogeneous cell types. Individual cells can be dissociated from solid tissues/organs and then analyzed by scRNA-seq. However, the cell-dissociation and subsequent harvesting and/or purification steps induce cryptic gene expression [14]. Due to such limitations, it is difficult to measure and compare the absolute transcript-counts of each gene in individual cells of the complex solid tissues/organs such as the heart, brain, kidney, etc. Furthermore, the differential transcriptome-size has biological importance. Several studies indicate that the cell-size influences the overall cellular transcription [15–18]. It is also reported that c-myc amplifies the global transcription in tumor cells [2, 19], lymphocytes and embryonic stem cells [20]. Another study shows that the global transcription is repressed by the loss of MECP2, a methyl CpG binding protein, in embryonic stem cell-derived neurons [21]. The genome structure, such as ploidy/gene-dosage and nucleosome state, affects the overall transcription [12, 22, 23]. In additions, it is shown that the total mRNA-contents of tumor cells are associated with the extent of the cancer progression [24]. These results illustrate biological importance of accounting for the transcriptome size differences among cells. In addition to the transcriptome-size, cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression is another problem with scRNA-seq, in particular with solid tissues/organs [14]. The scRNA-seq analyses of the solid tissues and organs require enzymatic digesting and mechanical dissociation of individual cells. Spatial scRNA-seq requires tissue processing such as sectioning and laser-mediated harvesting [8, 9]. Such technical procedures induce cryptic gene expression [14]. The currently available scRNA-seq largely disregard this problem. In this study, we address and overcome these limitations/problems associated with solid tissues/organs by developing a method to compute coefficients, cell type-specific weighting-factors ( cWFs ), to offset the transcriptome size- and cell dissociation/processing-induced problem. Furthermore, we also calculate cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs and use them to illustrate their diagnostic and biological utilities. 
 First, the major premise is as follows. If the transcriptome size differences and the cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression ( abbreviated as “cryptic gene expression” hereafter for convenience ) are corrected in the conventional scRNA-seq, the bulk ( i. e., tissue/organ ) RNA-seq should be the sum of gene expression of each composite cell-type weighted by cell-type ratios. We evaluated this premise. The synthetic whole-organ data were constructed from single-cell transcript counts combined according to the experimentally determined fraction of each cell-type in the organ. Briefly, the synthetic whole-organ RNA-seq data are calculated as the sum of the normalized transcript counts weighted by the known ratios of the composite cell-types of the organs, using the signature genes for distinguishing the cell-types for each organ ( see “Datasets”, “Data preprocessing”, “Calculation of reference cell-type ratios”, “Selection of signature gene sets” at the bottom of this section for the details ). The signature genes were determined by the random forest ( RF ) classifier. These synthetic data for 10 organs ( brain, fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen ) were then compared to the corresponding real whole-organ RNA-seq data ( Fig 1 ). The comparisons were performed by calculating their Pearson correlation coefficients. The result shows low Pearson correlation coefficients ( < 0. 75 ) for most of the organs ( brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, skeletal muscle ) regardless of the number ( 100, 300, 500 ) of the top-ranked signature genes used. Particularly low coefficients are found with the brain ( < 0. 6 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ), the fat ( < 0. 5 for 300, 500 signature genes ), the heart ( < 0. 4 for 300, 500 signature genes ), the pancreas ( < 0. 3 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ), the skin ( < 0. 2 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ), and the skeletal muscle ( < 0. 1 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ). These low Pearson correlation coefficients suggest that the transcriptome-size of individual cell-types varies, resulting in the large gaps. These results fail to satisfy the above-described major premise; hence, the differential transcriptome size-variations and/or the cryptic gene expression are unrepresented in the scRNA-seq data of the solid organs. To solve this problem, we developed an algorithm to compute such unrepresented factors ( Fig 2 ). The concept of the algorithm is schematically described in Fig 2 and as follows: In the real scRNA-seq data analyses, the total transcript counts per cell ( i. e., the transcriptome-size ) of the real scRNA-seq data are normalized ( i. e., the total counts per cell are equal among all composite cell-types of the organs ). This results in the loss of a factor representing the putative differences of the transcriptome-size and/or the cryptic gene expression across cell-types. This factor is computed as the cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ( indicated as w1, w2, w3, etc. in the Fig 2 ). Using this algorithm, we computed cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 organs as follows: We calculated at least 100 cWFs for each virtual-cell/cell-subject of each cell-type and made them follow Gaussian distribution, instead of one cWF per cell-type. Based on this concept, we developed a model as follows: my=∑jwjxj ( j∈Cm ) ( 1 ) where y∈ℝn, wj≥0 and xj∈ℝn denote the normalized whole-organ RNA-seq counts vector, the cWF for each cell subject j, and the normalized scRNA-seq counts vector for each cell subject j, respectively. The n is the total number of the signature genes for the organs. In this study, 100, 300, and 500 signature genes were selected according to the ranking on the basis of ‘Mean Decrease in Gini’ values calculated by the RF analyses. The numbers, 100, 300, and 500 were arbitrarily selected but the smaller number of signature genes is computationally more cost-effective. The combination of cell subjects, Cm was selected at random while maintaining the reference cell-type ratio of each organ. The cell-type ratios were determined by the RF classifier ( see “Datas” “preprocessing” “Calculation reference-type ratios” “Selection signature sets” at the bottom of this section for details. The cWFs were computed for 76 cell-types across 10 organs ( brain, fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen ) using the above model ( 1 ). The results are shown in Fig 3. The distributions of cWF for each organ are shown in Fig 4. The cWFs were used to reconstitute the bulk- RNA-seq data from scRNA-se data ( Fig 5 ). The reconstituted RNA-se data were compared to the real- RNA-se data ( Fig 6 ). The comparisons were performed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients. The results show high correlation ( > 0.9 ) for all organs ( brain, fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, skeletal, spleen ) regardless the number ( 100 300 500 ) of signature used. Particularly high coefficients found the brain ( >.9 for 100 300 500 signature ) the fat ( >.9 for 300 500 signature ) the heart >.9 for 300 500 signature the pancreas >. for 100 300 500 signature the skin >. for 100 300 500 the muscle > for 100 300 signature. These high correlation coefficients suggest that cWF effectively corrects the transcript-size and dissoci/processing-induced crypt gene in scRNA-se data of solid/organs. Furthermore, we show that cWF predict aging ( Fig 7 ), implicating their diagnostic and biological significance. 
The study provides an important method to solve limitations of scRNA-se analysis of complex tissues/organs. Our findings suggest the utility and biological significance of cWF.

    Title: 
    Article: Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simulatiously. MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core IV assumptions. Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are often considered to be potentially pleiotropic variants. Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVMR have so far been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis. We propose a radial formulation of MVMR, and an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualised. Radial MVMR additionally includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs which may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A RMVMR R package is presented as accompanying software for implementing the methods described. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses. We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR. We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy. We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ). In combination with simulated examples, we highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package. Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates, and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. 
 Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a methodological framework in which genetic variants- often single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) - are used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding [1, 2]. MR analyses are often performed using summary data from publicly available genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ), reflecting the ease with which such data can be accessed in contrast with individual-level data [3]. The extent to which MR causal effect estimates are unbiased is largely determined by three key assumptions. SNPs serving as instruments must be robustly associated with the exposure of interest ( IV1 ), there must be no confounding of the SNPs and the outcome ( IV2 ) and there must be no effect of the SNPs on the outcome that does not act via the exposure, i. e. no horizontal pleiotropy ( IV3 ) [4]. If all of these assumptions are satisfied for every SNP then the causal effect estimated by each SNP should differ only due to statistical chance. Heterogeneity in the per-SNP causal effects estimates is often taken to be an indication of violation of the IV assumptions and potential evidence of pleiotropic effects biasing the estimates obtained for some SNPs. SNPs that contribute to this heterogeneity by more than would be expected by chance are often considered to be outliers and their role in any potential pleiotropic effects investigated further. [5, 6] Radial MR has previously been proposed as a method for MR that allows for visualisation and removal of outliers, as measured by the SNPs that contribute more than expected by chance to heterogeneity in the analysis [7]. Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) is an extension to standard MR estimation which allows for the inclusion of multiple exposures, estimating the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome of interest, conditional on the other exposures included in the model [8–10]. MVMR can be used to obtain pleiotropy robust effect estimates when the mechanism by which the pleiotropy is acting is understood and measured. However, often it is unclear what the mechanism by which pleiotropic effects are acting, or many potential effects are thought to be present. A range of pleiotropy robust methods have been proposed for MVMR [11–13], however these do not focus on the identification of the SNPs contributing to heterogenetiy in MVMR. The multidimensional nature of MVMR means that it cannot be visualised in scatter plots as simply as MR. This makes visual inspection of outliers, or comparison of effects challenging. In this paper we present a Radial MVMR approach which allows for visualisation of the effects obtained in MVMR and identification of SNPs that are outlying based on their association with all of the exposures. We then show how Radial MVMR can be used to prune outliers and so obtain results that are not influenced by outlying SNPs. We illustrate the method through a simulation across a range of levels of balanced and unbalanced pleiotropy. To demonstrate the application of Radial MVMR we present an applied example evaluating the effects of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ), high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ), and triglycerides on coronary heart disease ( CHD ). We illustrate how univariable MR estimates for each of the exposures are biased by pleiotroic effects via the other exposures considered. We then show how the application of Radial MVMR can be used to visualise the MVMR results and to obtain more robust effect estimates through the identification and removal of SNPs which contribute more to heterogenetiy in the MVMR results than would be expected by chance. Throughout we perform all analyses using the RMVMR R package for the R software environment, which has been developed to facilitate the application of radial MVMR analyses. The RMVMR R package is available from https://github. com/WSpiller/RMVMR. 
 In univariable MR analyses one or more SNPs are used as instruments to estimate the causal effect of a single exposure X upon an outcome Y. Let Gj represent the jth independent SNP from a set of j ∈ {1, 2, …, J}, and let U denote one or more unmeasured confounders. A SNP is considered valid provided it satisfies assumptions IV1–3, with assumed relationships depicted in Fig 1. SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations are obtained from GWAS results that have been adjusted for population structure. Defining γ ^ j as the association between SNP j and the exposure X obtained from a GWAS of the exposure and Γ ^ j as the association between SNP j and the outcome Y obtained from a GWAS of the outcome, the per-SNP MR estimate of the effect of X on Y is given by; β ^ j = Γ ^ j γ ^ j ( 1 ) Combining this across j = ( 1, …, J ) uncorrelated SNPS the Inverse Variance Weighted ( IVW ) MR estimate is given by; β ^ I V W = ∑ j = 1 J w j β ^ j ∑ j = 1 J w j, ( 2 ) Where w j = γ ^ j 2 / σ ^ Y j 2 is the weighting applied to each SNP, σ ^ Y j 2 is the variance of the estimated SNP-outcome association Γ ^ j. [3] As described in Bowden et al ( 2018 ), an equivalent IVW estimate in Eq 2 can be obtained by fitting a radial regression model, regressing the product of the ratio estimate and square root weight attributed to each SNP against the set of square root weights across all SNPs [7]. β ^ j w j = β I V W w j + ϵ j ( 3 ) A key advantage of this transformation is that ϵj in this regression, i. e. the distance of each observation from the fitted regression line is equal to its square-root contribution to Cochran’s heterogeneity statistic, Q j, where Q = ∑ Q j = ∑ j = 1 J w j ( β j - β I V W ) 2 ( 4 ) Therefore by plotting β ^ j w j against w j it is possible to visualise the heterogeneity across SNPs in the data. The SNPs that influence this heterogeneity most, i. e. those with the largest values of wj ( βj − βIVW ) 2, can then be identified and pruned to obtain effect estimates that are not influenced by outlying values. This is most commonly done by removing all SNPs that explain more variation in Q than would be expected by chance and so have an individual SNP Q-statistic, Qj that has a p-value of less than 0. 05. MVMR extends the univariable MR framework to include multiple potentially correlated exposures, leveraging the entire set of SNPs associated with at least one included exposure [8, 10]. This allows for the direct effect of each exposure to be consistently estimated, ( that is, the effect of an exposure holding the others fixed ), provided that the MVMR assumptions hold; These assumption are illustrated in Fig 2. For i = {1, 2, …, N} observations including j = {1, 2, …, J} SNPs and k = {1, 2, …, K} exposures, defining m = {1, 2, …, M} as the exposures included in the model other than k, for which k ∉ m, a data generating process can be described as; X k i = γ k 0 + ∑ j = 1 J γ k j G j i + γ k ( J + 1 ) U i + ϵ i k (5 ) Y i = β 0 + ∑ j =1 β j G j G j i + ∑ k =1 β k X k X k i + ϵ i (6 ) where ϵ i ∼ N ( 0, σ 2 I ) and ϵ ∼ N ( 0, σ 2 ) are the error terms for the exposures and outcome respectively, G i is the vector of SNPs, X k is the vector of exposures, β is the vector of coefficients for the exposures and γ is the vector of coefficients for the SN. The MVM estimate of the effect of exposure k on Y is given by β ^ k = β k + ∑ j =1 β j γ j γ j k ( 7 ) The MVM estimate of the effect of exposure k on Y is given β ^ k = β k + ∑ =1 j β j γ j γ k ( 8 ) The M estimate of the effect of exposure k on Y given the other exposures is β ^ k = β k + ∑ = j β j γ j γ k ( 9 ) The M estimate of the effect of exposure on Y given the other exposures is β = k β + ∑ j β j γ j k ( 10 ) The M estimate of the effect of exposure on Y given the exposures is β k = β + ∑ β j γ j k (11 ) The M estimate of the effect of on Y given the exposures is β = β + ∑ β j γ (12 ) The estimate of effect of on Y given the exposures is β = β + β (13 ) The estimate of effect on Y given the exposures is β = β (14 ) The estimate effect of Y given exposures is β (15 ) The estimate Y given exposures is β (16 ) The estimate exposures given is β (17 ) The exposures given is β (18 ) The exposures is β (19 ) The is β (20 ) The β (21 ) β (22 ) β (23 ) β (24 ) β (25 ) β (26 ) β27 β (28 ) β29 β (30 ) β (31 ) β32 (33 ) β (34 )35 β36 ( ) (37 )38 (39 ) (40 ) (41 )42 (43 ) ( ) (44 ) (45 ) ( ) (46 ) ( ) (47 ) ( ) (48 ) ( ) (49 ) ( ) (50 ) (51 ) (52 ) (53 ) ( ) (54 ) ( ) (55 ) ( ) (56 ) ( ) (57 ) ( ) (58 ) ( ) (59 ) ( ) (60 ) ( ) ( ) (61 ) ( ) ( ) (62 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )

    Title: 
    Article: Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms. 
 Uncovering the temporal structure of behavior has long been a topic of theoretical interest and experimental challenge [1–4]. Animals carry out sequences of behaviors on many timescales, from the short timescales of the individual movements required for grooming, eating, and social communication to the longer timescales of hunger, arousal, diurnal cycles, mating seasons, and the aging process. The specifics of these behavior sequences determine much of what we can characterize about an animal, such as its health, reproductive fitness, and that idiosyncrasy of action that we might call ‘personality. ’ These behavior sequences also give us indirect ways to assess the internal processes of the animal, such as neural activity, gene expression, and other internal states like hunger or fatigue. An important aspect of animal behavior is how different timescales interact, from hours to days to lifespans. Investigating these interactions requires a model organism with a broad variety of behaviors but a short lifespan, to allow us to capture the breadth of all the timescales it might inhabit. Drosophila melanogaster have a rich set of behaviors, many of which are spontaneous and can occur in simple, isolated environments. Over the course of a 24-h light/dark cycle D. melanogaster have varying activity levels across hours, with particular peaks of activity in the morning and evening [5, 6] that are controlled by distinct populations of neurons [7]. As D. melanogaster age their circadian cycles break down [8], and their activity over different hours loses a defined pattern. Investigating the precise details of how the behaviors of hours become the behaviors of days become the behaviors of lifespans requires high-resolution data that covers the many timescales over which animal behavior varies. Historically, taking long-timescale data covering days or weeks of an animal’s life has required balancing continuity, throughput, and dimensionality. In D. melanogaster, simple experimental setups, such as beam-break assays allow for continuous monitoring of activity levels over days [9, 10], but fail to capture the high-resolution data necessary for modern techniques of behavior analysis such as MotionMapper [11], B-SOiD [12], VAME [13], or Keypoint-MoSeq [14]. On the other hand, the acquisition of high-resolution data has been restricted to short timescales by the computational resources required to store and process the extremely large imaging data, imposing an upper limit on the order of an hour. When studying fine-grained behavioral variation at longer timescales, previous work utilized short high-resolution recordings taken from different individuals with ages distributed across the lifespan of the animal and unsupervised behavioral classifications [15]. Other studies have taken continuous, lower frame-rate, lower-resolution recordings, which allow for supervised behavioral classifications [16–18]. These studies are able to provide longitudinal behavioral data, but are limited in their ability to identify discrete behavioral states, generally adding an additional non-locomotion/non-idle state which is labeled as “grooming” or “micromovement”. Here, we leverage recent computational advances to record a high-resolution continuous dataset of D. melanogaster behavior spanning 4-7 days. We recorded 47 freely moving D. melanogaster using constant IR illumination and an IR-sensitive camera at a frame rate of 100Hz, with a 12-h visible-light day/night cycle. We tracked 14 body parts from each fly using SLEAP [19] and utilized MotionMapper [11], an unsupervised machine-learning method, to develop data-driven definitions of stereotyped behavioral states, such as grooming, locomoting, and proboscis extension. These definitions are able to discriminate between different grooming modalities ( such as wing grooming vs. abdominal grooming ), and have a temporal resolution that can quantify individual steps. We use techniques of compositional data analysis [20] to characterize the dynamics of this behavioral repertoire across time of day and over the days of the experiment. We recapitulate many previously known characteristics of the D. melanogaster circadian cycle, and find distinct daily patterns in all measured behaviors, including grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion speed. We see an overall decline in the difference in behavior between day and night hours across days in the experiment as flies weaken and die, similar to the known weakening of circadian rhythms with age. Additionally, we find a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days. We identify the hour after dawn as ethologically unique, and show that this time point appears to track the general behavioral health of the flies. Our high-resolution data also reveals a difference in behavioral patterns during the morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily appearing in the grooming component of behavior. Overall, we find that our data captures both expected and novel patterns of D. melanogaster behavior across multiple 24-h periods. Our findings, particularly with regards to the ethological distinction between the morning and evening, offer a new window into the hourly and daily patterns of D. melanogaster activity, and represent a significant step forward in our ability to quantify the inherently multi-timescale structure of animal behavior. 
 We designed a recording apparatus to allow for continuous capture of D. melanogaster behavior over the course of days ( see Methods for details and S1A Fig ). D. melanogaster were constantly illuminated from above with IR light, to which they have minimal visual sensitivity [21], while LED panels provided a 12-h visible-light day/night cycle. Flies lived and behaved in 25 mm diameter, 1. 5 mm high cylindrical arenas over the course of our experiments ( S1B Fig ). We provided the flies with a base gel layer of sucrose-agarose, which permitted survival of up to 7 days while preventing the significant fungal growth observed when yeast extract was included. We recorded four freely behaving D. melanogaster in individual chambers per camera at 100 Hz with a resolution of 28. 25 pixels/mm ( Fig 1A ). This is sufficient to resolve relevant features of the D. melanogaster body such as the tarsi ( leg tips ) and proboscis ( Fig 1B ). Our experiments have both a change in light intensity and temperature conditions between day and night, with daytime temperature levels varying between different experiments ( ~ 28–29 ∘C for experiments 1–2, and ~ 30–31 ∘C for experiments 3–4 ) and nighttime temperatures settling to ~ 27 ∘C for all experiments ( see Methods and S9 Fig ). These unusually high temperatures are primarily due to our intense IR back light, which facilitated a very short exposure time for low motion blur imaging. It is important to note that heat shock proteins can be activated at these temperatures and temperatures in this range influence lifespan [22]. Our results represent the combined effect of light intensity and temperature changes over the course of a day. For each experiment, we imaged male isoKH11 D. melanogaster from two days post-eclosion ( emergence from the pupa as an adult insect ) until death, yielding 4-8 days of continuous recording with half the flies dying by Day 5 ( Fig 1C ), for a total of 5, 584 fly-hours. Note that this lifespan is shorter than conventional assays, likely due to the nutrient-limited sucrose-based food source used to reduce fungal growth [23] and higher-than-optimal temperatures. To extract postural information from our data, we used SLEAP, a deep-learning-based framework that can infer animal posture based on user-generated training data [19] ( See Methods for details ). We tracked a 14-point skeleton comprised of the head, eyes, thorax, abdomen, wing tips, tarsi, and proboscis of each individual ( Figs 1B and S2 ). We limited our subsequent behavior analysis to time points when the flies were on the bottom of the arena ( as opposed to the walls or ceiling ), as this gave the highest quality tracks ( S3 Fig ). In order to quantify discrete, stereotyped behaviors, we modified the MotionMapper pipeline [11], an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to classify the postural data into distinct states, such as grooming, locomotion, and probis extension. We trained the model on a subset of the data and then applied it to the rest of the data. We used compositional analysis [20] to characterize the dynamics of the behavioral repertoire across time and days. This approach allowed us to identify distinct patterns in behavior, such as grooming modalities, probis extension, and locomotion speed. Our results recapitulate known characteristics of the D. melanaster circadian cycle and reveal daily patterns in measured behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locomotion speed. We find an overall decline in the difference between day and night hours across days the experiment as flies weaken and die, similar to the weakening of circadian rhythms with age. Additionally, we find a decline in probis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time in idle increases across days. We identify the hour as unique and show that this point tracks the general health of the flies. Our high-resolution data reveals a difference in patterns during morning and evening peaks activity, primarily in the grooming component behavior. Overall, our data captures both expected and novel of D melanaster behavior across 24 periods. Our findings, particularly regarding the distinction between morning and evening, offer a new into the hourly and daily of Daster activity and represent a step in our ability to quantify the multi-times of animal behavior. 
The study of animal behavior has long been a topic of interest and challenge [1–4]. Animals carry out sequences of behaviors on timescales from the short times of individual movements for grooming, eating, and communication to the times of hunger, arousal, diurnal cycles, seasons, and aging. The specifics of these sequences determine much of what can characterize an animal, such as health, reproductive fitness, and idiosrasy of action we call ‘personality ’. These sequences also give indirect ways to assess internal processes such as neural, gene, and other states like hunger or fatigue. An important of behavior is how times interact from hours to days lifans. Investigating these requires organism with broad of behaviors but short lifespan to capture breadth of times might. D melanogaster have rich behaviors many of which are spontaneous and occur simple environments. Over 24-h lightark D melanaster have varying levels hours with peaks in morning and evening [5, 6] controlled by distinct neurons [7. As melan age circadian break [8] and activity over hours loses defined. Investigating precise how behaviors become behaviors lifans requires high data that covers times over animal varies. Historically, long data covering days weeks an life required balancing, throughput, and dimension. melan simple setups such as beam assays allow monitoring activity over [9,10 but fail capture high data necessary modern techniques such as Motion [11, BOi [12, V [13, Keointo [14 ] On other hand, acquisition high data restricted short by resources store process extremely large imposing upper hour. studying fine-grained variation longer times previous utilized recordings individuals ages across lifespan unsup classifications [15. studies continuous lower-rate recordings supervised [–18 ] provide longitudinal but limited identify states generally additional nonlootion/nonle labeled “groom” “rom” Here we leverage advances record high-resolution dataset D melan spanning 4-7. recorded 47 moving using constant illumination camera frame 100 with 12-light cycle. tracked 14 parts each using SLE [19 and Motion [11 unsupervised machine develop definitions stereot states such as grooming, locomotion, probis.

    Title: 
    Article: Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however, their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored. Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-biased genetic screen, we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ), which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. To better understand the functions of PTPN-22, we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development. Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22. Consistent with this interaction, loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis, co-localization studies, and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly within the germline, as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions. 
 Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is a key mechanism for regulating diverse cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and signal transduction. The steady-state level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is regulated by the coordinated effects of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) and protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ). Of the 518 protein kinases in humans, 90 ( 17% ) are classified as PTKs, whereas of the 200 protein phosphatases, 108 ( 54% ) are classified as PTPs [1–3]. Despite their greater abundance, PTPs have garnered less attention from researchers than PTKs. Nevertheless, it is known that dysfunction of PTPs can disrupt the homeostasis of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, contributing to a spectrum of disorders including cancers and neuronal and autoimmune diseases [4–9]. Notably, among the 237 protein phosphatases in C. elegans, 94 are presumed to be PTPs and over 50% of C. elegans phosphatases have human orthologs [10, 11]. Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type ( PTPN ) is a subset of the PTP family comprising 17 protein tyrosine phosphatases in humans. One well-studied member of this family, PTPN22, has been investigated primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin including lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets [12–17]. Correspondingly, one of the most well-characterized functions of PTPN22 is the suppression of T-cell activation. In conjunction with C-terminal Src tyrosine kinase ( CSK ), PTPN22 is responsible for dephosphorylating T-cell signaling receptors including LCK, FYN, CD3ζ, and ZAP-70 [18, 19]. Moreover, a missense polymorphism in PTPN22, which leads to a R620W substitution in the C terminus of PTPN22, is a common risk factor for multiple autoimmune diseases including type I diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis [20–24]. PTPN22 expression is also detected in epithelial, endothelial, muscle, and nervous tissue, suggesting additional roles for this phosphatase, although it has been less well studied in these contexts [14–16, 25, 26]. PTPs also contribute to the formation and maintenance of adhesion complexes in human cells. Several members of the PTPN family including PTPN11, PTP-PEST ( PTPN12 ), and PTPN22 are recognized as key regulators of integrin function. Integrins are transmembrane αβ heterodimeric receptors that connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, and their activation is regulated by phosphorylation to control cell movement and adhesion [27–30]. In human T cells, PTPN22 inhibits signaling by integrin subunit alpha L ( ITGAL ), which is also known as integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 ( LFA-1 ), and loss of PTPN22 function results in increased ITGAL–mediated cell adhesion [31]. In PTPN22–/–mice, regulatory T cells also exhibit an increase in ITGAL–dependent adhesion, and these mice show an increase in platelet-specific αIIbβ3 integrin activation along with increased platelet spreading and aggregation [32, 33]. Together these findings implicate PTPN22 in cell adhesion, although analogous functions for PTPN22 beyond the immune system remain largely unexplored. As described below, we identified the C. elegans ortholog of PTPN22 in a genetic screen for genes that affect the C. elegans molting process. Molting is an essential developmental process in nematodes and other members of the ecdysozoan group, allowing for organismal growth and adaptation to new environments [34]. Molting occurs at the termination of each of the four larval stages ( L1–L4 ), wherein a new cuticle—an apical extracellular matrix surrounding the epidermis—is synthesized and the old cuticle is released. Many different types of proteins have roles in the molting process including signal transducers, transcriptional regulators, structural components and modifiers of the cuticle, cell–ECM adhesion complexes, and proteins that affect membrane trafficking [34–36]. Previous work in our laboratory identified two conserved Serine–Threonine-specific NIMA-related kinases, NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ) ( collectively referred to as the NEKLs ) —along with their three ankyrin repeat binding partners, MLT-2 ( human ANKS6 ), MLT-3 ( human ANKS3 ), and MLT-4 ( human INVS ) ( collectively referred to as the MLTs ) —as being required for molting [37, 38]. Ongoing research continues to uncover the precise mechanisms by which NEKLs and MLTs affect the molting process in C. elegans. Most notably, we have shown that NEKLs and their human counterparts regulate several aspects of membrane trafficking [39, 40]. Further insights into the functions of NEKLs came from the isolation of genetic suppressors of nekl molting defects, which include core components of the endocytic machinery and several closely associated factors that regulate actin filamentation, including the Rho-family GTPase CDC-42 and its effector SID-3, which is the ortholog of human TNK2 ( tyrosine kinase non receptor 2; also known as ACK1, activated CDC42-associated kinase 1 ) [40–42]. In this study, we identified mutations affecting PTPN-22, which we showed binds to the Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) DNBP-1, loss of which also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Using genetic, proteomic, and cell biological approaches, we have implicated PTPN-22 in a range of functions including effects on epidermal adhesion complexes, cytoskeletal proteins, and potential germline expression functions, thereby expanding substantially on the known functions of PTPN22 family members. 
 We previously showed that nekl-2 and nekl-3 are required for molting in C. elegans, as strong loss-of-function mutations in either gene cause molting defects in early larval development [37, 38]. In contrast, the weak loss-of-function mutations nekl-2 ( fd81 ) and nekl-3 ( gk894345 ) do not exhibit phenotypes individually, but when combined they lead to ~98% of double-mutant larvae arresting at the L2/L3 molt ( Fig 1A and 1B ) [37]. nekl-2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl-3 ( gk894345 ) homozygotes ( hereafter referred to as nekl-2; nekl-3 ) can be maintained in the presence of an extrachromosomal array ( fdEx286 ) that contains wild-type copies of nekl-3 along with a broadly expressed GFP reporter ( SUR-5::GFP; Fig 1A ) [37]. To identify proteins that functionally interact with NEKL kinases, we carried out a nonbiased genetic screen for suppressors of nekl-2; ne-3 molting defects. We screened ~6000 transgenic lines for suppressors of nekl-2; ne-3 molting and identified 14 that suppressed the molting phenotype ( Fig 1C ). Among these 14 suppressors, we identified PTP-22 as a phosphatase required for molting ( Fig 1D ). PTP-22 is the C elegans ortholog of human PTP22, a well-stud protein tyine phosphatase in hematopoietic cells [12–17]. PTP-22 has been implicated in T-cell signaling [18, 19] and is associated with autoimmune diseases [20–24], but its functions beyond the hematopoietic system have been less explored [14–16, 25, 26]. To confirm the role of P-22 in molting, we generated a loss-of-function allele of P-22 by CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) mediated genome editing ( Fig 1E ) and found that loss of P-22 suppressed ne- associated molting defects ( Fig 1F ). To understand the function of P-22 in molting, we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify interactors of P-22 during development. This approach identified DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of P-22 ( Fig 2A ). DNBP-1 is the C eleg ortholog of human DNMB, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC42 [43]. Consistent with this interaction, loss of DN-1 also suppressed ne-associated molting ( Fig 2B ). DN-1 and P-22 co-localize to epidermal adhesion complexes including C elegans hemidesomes ( Fig 2C ) suggesting that P- plays a role in maintaining structural integrity of tissues. Proximity labeling also implicated P- in functions connected nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germl ( Fig 2D ) nearly one-third of proteins identified by P- labeling are P gran components. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying gene functions.

    Title: 
    Article: Current malaria elimination targets must withstand a colossal challenge–resistance to the current gold standard antimalarial drug, namely artemisinin derivatives. If artemisinin resistance significantly expands to Africa or India, cases and malaria-related deaths are set to increase substantially. Spatial information on the changing levels of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia is therefore critical for health organisations to prioritise malaria control measures, but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse. We use a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene, which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance, and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance. Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022. Moreover, the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region. Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in a way that is not possible using data alone, thereby enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution. By predicting for the first time spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level, this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia. 
 Antimalarial drugs are essential tools for the control and elimination of malaria. Resistance to all currently available antimalarials, including the pivotal artemisinin derivatives, have been confirmed. This situation is dire considering how the multi-foci emergence and spread of resistance to other antimalarial drugs–chloroquine and, later, sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine ( SP ) –have resulted in dramatic increases in malaria-related morbidity and mortality [1]. Studies conducted in 2006–2007 first reported that P. falciparum in north-west Cambodia had reduced in vivo susceptibility to artemisinins, which manifested as delayed clearance of parasites from the blood of patients treated with ACTs [2]. Delayed parasite clearance in P. falciparum infections following artemisinin-based therapies is the clinical hallmark of resistance [3]. P. falciparum infections with significantly slowed parasite clearance under artemisinin-based therapies have now been detected in neighbouring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion; namely in Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar [4, 5]. Spatial information on changes to antimalarial resistance is critical for health organisations to prioritise control measures, but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse. No such fine-scale predictive maps exist for artemisinin resistance within Southeast Asia. However, to generate predictive maps using appropriate model-based geostatistics, large numbers of unique spatio-temporal locations are needed [6]. This is impossible to achieve with clinical measures of resistance; the data are simply not available owing to the expensive and time-consuming nature of clinical studies [4, 7]. A way forward is to use molecular markers associated with resistance. Genetic mutations known to be associated with drug resistance can be used to monitor spatio-temporal trends in antimalarial drug resistance as a proxy of clinical efficacy. Genetic studies are easier to conduct and are a fraction of the cost of clinical studies, thereby allowing larger numbers of samples to be collected across more spatio-temporal locations [7]. Data from genetic studies are readily amenable to model-based geostatistics. In a previous study, Flegg et al. developed a predictive model for the geographical and temporal trends across Africa of the prevalence of mutations in the dhps gene of the parasite that are known to be associated with SP resistance [8]. A continuous predictive surface in space and time was inferred for dhps markers using Bayesian model–based geostatistics over the spatial domain of sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2010. This has since been extended with more data to make more recent predictions up until 2020 [9]. These models were built in a Bayesian framework so that predictions can be informed not only by the observed data but also by prior knowledge. The maps have proved useful to policymakers, and the predictive maps of SP resistance were combined with clinical data on low birthweight [10]. The analysis showed that SP should be considered compromised, and countries should switch to alternative strategies if the dhps-A581G marker is prevalent at more than 30%. In 2014, mutations in the propeller region of the K13 protein that are associated with slow parasite clearance response to artemisinins were identified and almost 200 different candidate mutant genotypes were established [11]–a list that has been subsequently revised [12]. Since the identification of K13 markers, many studies have been conducted ( and historical blood samples reanalysed ) so that now a significant amount of data exists on the prevalence of these markers. In this paper, data-driven, predictive spatio-temporal maps are presented for the first time of the changing landscape of resistance to artemisinin derivatives across the Greater Mekong Subregion. We develop a geostatistical model of the presence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance, in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene, calibrated to the most comprehensive dataset available from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network ( WWARN ). The spatio-temporal maps of K13 marker prevalence presented in this paper will be able to support monitoring of drug resistance in Southeast Asia, appropriate targeting of preventive strategies and malaria elimination efforts. 
 We use data publicly available through WWARN’s comprehensive artemisinin molecular surveyor [13], which collates the prevalence of molecular markers in the propeller region of the K13 gene of the malaria parasite. All non-synonymous mutations at any K13 locus > 440 ( i. e., within the propeller region ) are captured along with a date of sample collection and geospatial information. In some studies, a non-synonymous mutation in locus 252, outside the propeller domain, was captured. Data were included from diverse types of studies, for example, cross-sectional studies and therapeutic efficacy trials; however, any studies whose samples were collected after treatment with an antimalarial were not included. Note that the spatial location refers to the sample collection site, which in some instances could differ from the location of infection. For example, artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum infections may have been detected in Thailand, resulting from movement across borders from Cambodia and Myanmar [14]. Only studies where an individual site location could be determined ( e. g. a single village ) were included in the study; for any aggregated data ( e. g. across multiple villages ), the data contributors were contacted, and individual site locations were sourced. We downloaded data from WWARN’s Artemisinin Molecular Surveyor on 7 June 2023. In this work, we model the overall prevalence of any K13 mutation that has been associated with delayed parasite clearance [12]. That is, a sample is classified as ‘positive’ if it has a mutation at any K13 locus listed in Table 1 and classified as ‘negative’ otherwise. For a given study, the prevalence of K13 mutations is then defined as the proportion of positive K13 samples out of those tested. We include only studies with a sample size of at least 10. Fig 1A shows the spatial locations of 431 studies included in the analysis; the studies were conducted in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam ( Fig 1B ). In each of these countries, the trend of K13 marker prevalence has risen since the early 2000s ( Fig 1C ). S1 Video shows the time course of K13 data collection over the period of 2000 to 2022, for which the data visualised in each year shows studies conducted before or during the year associated with the map. 
 Overall, there is good agreement between the observed ( in hold-out data ) and predicted prevalence ( correlation coefficient of 0. 82 ). There is a small amount of bias ( mean error of −0. 0035 ), and the accuracy is reasonable ( mean absolute error of 0. 13 ). Fig G in S1 Text shows good agreement between the observed and predicted prevalence, and reliability of the credible intervals is strong, especially for narrow intervals. When we perform a spatially explicit cross validation with the data spatially clustered into 50 clusters, there is still reasonable agreement between observed and predicted prevalence ( correlation coefficient of 0. 56, mean error of -0. 058 and mean absolute error of 0. 22 ). Fig 2 compares the predicted distributions at two locations: Pailin, Cambodia ( left-hand side ), and Kyaukme, Myanmar ( right-hand side ), in 2000 ( second row ) and 2020 ( third row ). The complete posterior predictive distribution is presented, and the median is shown as a solid red vertical line. In 2000, the predicted level of K13 prevalence is already high in Pailin compared with Kyaukme. By 2020, both locations have increased predicted levels of resistance compared with 2000. The posterior predictive distribution of K13 prevalence is obtained on a 5 x 5 km grid in the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022. The median and uncertainty ( standard deviation ) of the distribution are shown in Fig 3 for the Greater Mekong Subregion in 2000, 2010 and 2020, in regions where the median estimate of K13 is above 10% are shaded in red. In 200, the region of highest K13 prevalence is in the western part of Cambodia. By 2010, the region of highest K13 has shifted to eastern part of Cambodia. By 202, the region of highest K13 has shifted to western part of Vietnam. The region of highest K13 in 202 is the western part of Vietnam. In 201, the region of highest K13 is the eastern part of Laos. The region of K13 in 202 is western part of Myanmar. The region of K in 202 is western part of Thailand. The region K in 202 is western part of Cambodia. The region in 202 is western of Vietnam. The region in 202 is western of Laos. The region 202 is western of Myanmar.

    Title: 
    Article: Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins, including NLRP1 and CARD8, are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway, critical for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides, which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. However, the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes, while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction. In addition, we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex, DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complex; however, DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of hNLRP1. Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8, it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response. 
 Inflammasomes are high-molecular-weight multiprotein complexes that play a critical role in detecting pathogenic microorganisms and endogenous danger signals, thereby mediating the activation of inflammatory caspases [1]. In canonical inflammasome pathways, nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-like receptors ( NLRs ) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) or damage-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ), typically activating caspase-1 through the adaptor protein Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD ( ASC ) [1]. In noncanonical inflammasomes, murine caspase-11 or human caspase-4/5 directly recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide [2, 3]. Activation of these caspases leads to the cleavage of gasdermin D ( GSDMD ), liberating the pore-forming GSDMD-N domain from the inhibitory GSDMD-C domain, resulting in pore formation in the plasma membrane and subsequent pyroptotic cell death [4, 5]. Additionally, caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to produce mature cytokines during canonical inflammasome activation; notably, human caspase-4 can directly process pro-IL-18 into mature IL-18 during noncanonical inflammasome activation [6]. Among the canonical inflammasome pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ), both NLRP1 and CARD8 contain a unique function-to-find domain ( FIIND ), which undergoes autoproteolysis to yield two noncovalently associated polypeptides: the N terminus ( NT ) and the C terminus ( CT ) [7]. Human NLRP1 ( hNLRP1 ) is structured with an N-terminal PYD, followed by the NACHT domain, LRR, FIIND, and a C-terminal CARD. Three linker regions separate these domains: Linker1 between PYD and NACHT, Linker2 between NACHT and LRR, and Linker3 between LRR and FIIND [8]. In contrast, murine NLRP1 paralogs lack the PYD and Linker1 regions [8]. Murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) recognizes Bacillus anthracis infection by detecting its bacterial protease, anthrax lethal toxin ( LT ). LT specifically cleaves the N-terminal fragment between amino acid 44 and 45, which triggers the proteasomal degradation of mNLRP1bNT by the ubiquitin ligase UBR2, liberating mNLRP1bCT for inflammasome assembly [9–11]. Additionally, the ubiquitin ligase IpaH7. 8 from Shigella Flexneri also degrades mNLRP1bNT via proteasomal degradation, activating the mNLRP1b inflammasome [10]. Unlike mNLRP1b, hNLRP1 is capable of sensing diverse stimuli during viral infection through various functional domains. For instance, the 3C protease of enterovirus cleaves hNLRP1 at Linker1, resulting in degradation of hNLRP1NT and activation of the hNLRP1 inflammasome [12]. Semliki Forest virus activates the hNLRP1 inflammasome through viral dsRNA in keratinocytes, requiring the dsRNA-binding activity of LRR and the ATPase activity of NACHT [13]. Moreover, hNLRP1 directly interacts with the structural protein ORF45 during Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) infection via the Linker1 region, leading to the disruption of autoinhibitory complexes and activation of the hNLRP1 inflammasome [8]. Beyond viral infection, the hNLRP1 inflammasome also responds to ultraviolet B- and toxin-induced ribotoxic stress response in keratinocytes via cellular ZAKα kinase, which phosphorylates the Linker1 region of hNLRP1 [14, 15]. Furthermore, dsDNA mimetic poly ( dA:dT ) and dsRNA mimetic poly ( I:C ) can trigger the hNLRP1 inflammasome in keratinocytes [13, 16]. CARD8 shares similarities with NLRP1, possessing the FIIND-CARD regions but lacking the structural domains such as PYD, NACHT, and LRR. Instead, CARD8 contains a 160-amino-acid unstructured region in the N terminus [7]. The CARD8 inflammasome is activated by the protease activity during HIV-1 infection, which cleaves the N-terminal unstructured region [17]. The activation of the CARD8 inflammasome results in pyroptotic cell death in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, further contributing to HIV-1 pathogenesis and disease progression [18]. Similarly, the viral protease of Coxsackie B3 virus cleaves the N-terminal region of CARD8, leading to inflammasome activation that is associated with viral myocarditis in cellular model [19]. The C-terminal CARD of NLRP1 and CARD8 is critical for inflammasome assembly. The NLRP1 inflammasome comprises NLRP1CT, ASC, and caspase-1, whereas the CARD8 inflammasome consists solely of CARD8CT and caspase-1 [20, 21]. The cellular DPP9 binds to the FIIND of NLRP1 or CARD8 and keeps them in an inactive state. The DPP9-FIIND complex, which includes DPP9, full-length NLRP1 or CARD8, and NLRP1CT or CARD8CT, prevents activation of CT fragments without stimuli. Inhibition with the DPP8/9 inhibitor Val-boroPro ( VbP ) disrupts this inhibitory complex and allows for inflammasome activation through C-terminal fragment liberation [22–24]. Our recent study has also shown that hNLRP1 forms various autoinhibitory complexes with or without DPP9, indicating the Linker1 region plays a significant role in mediating the association between hNLRP1NT and hNLRP1CT [8]. Since Linker1 is unique to hNLRP1, the formation of similar autoinhibitory complexes with other NLRP1 paralogs or CARD8 is yet to be elucidated. It is believed that mNLRP1bNT interacts with mNLRP1bCT to silence the inflammasome activity [8–11]; however, the specifics of this interaction have not been clear demonstrated. Here, we utilized biochemistry approaches to characterize the autoinhibitory complexes of CARD8 and rodent NLRP1 variants, including mNLRP1b and rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ), revealing that all of these proteins form both NT-CT and FL-CT complexes. albeit through distinct mechanisms. 
 NLRP1 and CARD8 are the sole mammalian proteins containing FIIND domain and they exist in three forms at steady state: full-length protein ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal peptide ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal peptide ( CT ). This diversity arises due to autoproteolysis within the FI domain. The NT and CT are noncovalently associated in autohibitory complexes in the steady state. However, the detailed mechanism of these interactions remains elusive. We found that NLR1 paral and CARD8 form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FLCT interactions but distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Link3 region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 ( mLR1 ) plays an essential role in forming NT-CT autohibitory complexes while the Z5 of rat NLR1 and CARD8 mediate NT-CT interactions. In addition, we explored the involvement of cellular protease dipeptid peptidase 9 ( DPP ) in these complexes revealing differential interactions and significance of domain. DPP interacts with FL of NLR1 and CARD through their Z5 subdomains forming FL-DPP-CT complex, however DPP cannot bind to NT of NLR1. Further functional assay indicated that DPP is involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR1 CARD but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT. Our study enhanced understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autohibition and underscored complexity of interactions within immune response.

    Title: 
    Article: Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and, consequently, overall tissue health. In various growing tissues, cell competition based mechanisms facilitate detection and elimination of these compromised, often referred to as ‘loser’, cells by the healthier neighbors. The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth, albeit under high proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. In summary, these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival. 
 The development of healthy tissue requires the removal of viable but suboptimal cells. In several growing tissues, this vital culling process is orchestrated through a specific cell-cell interaction called cell competition. In this intricate mechanism, unfit cells, also called “loser”, are eliminated by their surrounding fitter counterparts, the “winner” cells [1, 2], thereby maintaining tissue health [3]. The best-known example of cell competition is described in the developing Drosophila epithelium using the heterozygous mutations in a ribosomal protein ( Rp ) gene ( also known as Minute ). The Rp+/- flies are viable, however, under mosaic condition the Rp+/- cells are eliminated from the developing epithelium when juxtaposed with the neighboring wild-type ( Rp+/+ ) cells [4–6]. Although the Rp+/- mutation affects cellular physiology autonomously, caspase-dependent apoptosis is observed mostly at the boundary between Rp+/- cells and nearby Rp+/+ cells, which is a hallmark of cell competition [6, 7]. The loser fate of the slow growing Rp+/- cells was suggested to be due to reduced protein translation [8–10]. However, recent studies have shown that Rp+/- cells exhibit high proteotoxic stress [11–14] and activate the expression of bZip transcription factor Xrp-1, which plays an essential role in the elimination of the Rp+/- cells [11, 15, 16]. Interestingly, Xrp-1 appears to be responsible for the manifestation of various defects in Rp+/- cells, including reduced global translation and proteotoxic stress, contributing to the loser status [17]. Moreover, the loser fate is associated with a number of other physiological changes impacting cell fitness. These changes include, 1 ) reduced metabolic activity due to alteration in the mTOR pathway activity [18, 19], 2 ) loss of apico-basal polarity as a consequence of mutations of the scribble, dlg, and lgl genes [20], 3 ) defects in endosomal trafficking caused by mutations in the rab5 gene [21], and 4 ) deregulation of signaling pathways such as Wnt, BMP, and Hippo [22–24]. Cells bearing these perturbations are eliminated through cell competition involving JNK-dependent activation of the proapoptotic factors [6, 25]. Interestingly, some perturbations can also provide a competitive advantage to the cells over their wild-type neighbors. For instance, the overexpression of a proto-oncogene Myc, a master regulator of cell proliferation and growth, enhances the relative fitness of the cells. Thus, clonal expression of Myc generates super-competitor cells, which proliferate at the expense of the wild-type neighbors [10, 26]. Myc drives cellular growth through its ability to upregulate the expression of a large number of genes and enhance the activity of several crucial metabolic pathways [27–29]. However, Myc-overexpression also leads to proteotoxic stress due to increased protein synthesis [30–32]. Thus, Myc-driven overgrowth is dependent on the activation of the cytoprotective unfolded protein response pathways ( UPR ) [33]. This includes phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha ( eIF2α ) via PERK ( PKR-like ER kinase ) and induction of autophagy to reduce protein translation and clear misfolded proteins, respectively [34, 35]. However, a clear understanding of how Myc and UPR cooperate to promote a proliferative cellular environment remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of Retention in Endoplasmic Reticulum-1 ( Rer1 ) protein in the competitive cell proliferation in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Mutations in the rer1 gene were first described in yeast, where it was identified in a screen as a factor required for proper transport of Sec12p between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi [36]. Later studies have shown that Rer1 is also required for the assembly of multisubunit protein complexes, for example, the tetrameric γ-secretase complex, yeast iron transporter and skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) [37–42]. Rer1 is also known to regulate ER homeostasis, and therefore loss of Rer1 has been shown to induce ER stress in yeast and worms [43]. Despite the fact that Rer1 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, its function in the development of organisms remains largely unknown [43–45]. By creating a rer1 loss-of-function mutant, we show that rer1 is an essential gene in Drosophila. Furthermore, we found that loss of Rer1 creates proteotoxic stress in the developing wing epithelium, and when surrounded by wild-type cells, the clonal population of rer1 mutant cells attained the loser fate and were eliminated specifically via the process of cell competition. We have also analyzed the role of Rer1 in Myc-induced overgrowth and Rer1 levels were found to be upregulated upon Myc-overexpression. More importantly, we found that loss of Rer1 is sufficient to suppress Myc-induced overgrowth. In summary, our results demonstrate that Rer1 is an essential protein for proper maintenance of protein homeostasis and competitive cell survival in a developing tissue. 
 We first set out to characterize the role of Rer1 during Drosophila development. To this end, we generated a rer1 knockout mutant by imprecise excision of a p-element insertion in the rer1 locus ( see materials and methods ). A loss-of-function mutation in rer1 containing a 1560 bp deletion in the coding region was identified ( Fig 1A ). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis in the homozygous mutant ( rer1–/– ) animals confirmed a complete loss of rer1 mRNA levels, indicating a complete loss-of-function ( S1A Fig ). Further analysis showed that the rer1–/–larvae failed to develop into pupae and died during the larval stages ( S1B Fig ). To rule out the possibility of lethality arising due to a second site mutation in another essential gene, we performed rescue experiments using a genomic-rescue construct expressing GFP-tagged Rer1 via the endogenous promoter ( see materials and methods ). The expression of GFP-rer1 in homozygous rer1–/–flies led to a complete rescue of lethality, confirming the specificity of the mutant ( S1B Fig ). These results underscore the indispensability of Rer1 in Drosophila development. We next analyzed the importance of Rer1 at the tissue level using the developing Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We first depleted Rer1 in the posterior compartment of the wing discs by expressing rer1-RNAi using the hedgehog ( hh ) -Gal4 driver ( S1C Fig ). To test the efficiency of the knockdown, we expressed rer1-RNAi in the GFP-rer1 genomic-rescue flies. Here, we observed a strong downregulation of the GFP-Rer1 levels ( S1D Fig ), suggesting that rer1-RNAi effectively downregulated the Rer1 levels. We assessed the impact of Rer1 depletion on cell death by analyzing the levels of cleaved Death caspase-1 ( Dcp-1 ) and Acridine Orange ( AO ) as apoptosis markers. Rer1 depletion in the posterior compartment led to a strong increase in both Dcp-1 and AO positive cells as compared to the control anterior compartment ( S1E–S1H Fig; quantified in S1I and S1J Fig, respectively ). Intriguingly, despite the increased cell death, the adult wing of these flies appeared normal ( S1K–S1N Fig; quantified in S1O Fig ). To delve further, we generated rer1–/–clones using the heat-shock-inducible Flippase ( FLP ) -Flp recognition target ( FRT ) -system ( see materials and methods ). Clones were induced during early larval stages ( 48 hrs ) and allowed to develop into adults. We found that rer–clones were eliminated from the wing epithelium when juxtaposed with wild-type cells ( S1–1 Fig ). The loss of rer–clones was accompanied by an increase in D-1 and AO positive cells (1–1 Fig; quantified S1 and S1 Fig, respectively ). These results indicate that rer mutant cells are eliminated through cell competition with their wild-type neighbors. To investigate the role of R1 in My-induced overgrowth, we overexpressed Myc in the posterior compartment of the wing discs using the hh-Gal4 driver (1 Fig 2A ). We observed a significant increase in the number of cells in the posterior compartment compared to the anterior ( Fig 2B ). To determine the impact of R1 on My-driven growth, we depleted R1 in the posterior compartment using rer-Ri ( Fig 2C ). We observed a decrease in the number of cells in the posterior compared to the anterior ( Fig 2 ). These results suggest that R1 is required for My-induced overgrowth. Furthermore, we found that R1 levels are upregulated in My-overexpressing cells ( Fig 2D ). To test the sufficiency of R1 in My-driven growth, we depleted R1 in My-overing cells using rer-Ri ( Fig 2 ) and observed a decrease in the number of cells ( Fig 2 ). These results indicate that R1 is sufficient for My-induced growth. We also found that loss of R1 alleviates proteotoxic stress in My-overing cells ( Fig 2 ), suggesting that R1 provides cytoprotection to My-over cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress. In summary, our results demonstrate that R1 acts as a regulator of proteinostasis in Dophila and its role in competitive survival.

    Title: 
    Article: Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3, 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2, however, have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ). One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity. Here we tested all but two of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ). Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2, 417 were tolerated. The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. Combined, this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. 
 Cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 ( CHK2 ) is a conserved protein involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage responses. First discovered in 1998 as the mammalian ortholog of Rad53 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CHK2 has established roles in DNA double strand break repair, DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [1]. CHK2 is a 543 amino acid nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that contains three distinct functional domains; an SQ/TQ cluster domain ( SCD ), a forkhead-associated ( FHA ) domain and a kinase domain. When DNA damage occurs, activated ATM phosphorylates CHK2 at T68 [2–4]. This phosphorylation induces dimerization of CHK2 monomers through the binding of the phosphorylated SCD of one CHK2 monomer with the FHA domain of another, initiating autophosphorylation within the kinase domain ( S260, T420 ), the activation loop ( T383, T387 ), and the C-terminus ( S516 ) [5–7]. Activated CHK2 monomers spread the DNA damage signal by phosphorylating downstream protein targets to halt the cell cycle, recruit various proteins to the site of DNA damage, and initiate apoptosis when necessary [1, 8–10]. CHEK2 is a moderately penetrant gene that has been studied for its association with cancer predisposition [11]. Women with the heterozygous founder mutation CHEK2 c. 1100delC, which leads to a protein truncation in the kinase domain, have a 2-3-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer [12–14]. This pathogenic variant has also been associated with increased risk for male breast cancer, gastric, testicular, prostate, and thyroid cancers [15–20]. Additional CHEK2 variants that impair protein function have been identified in the germline of individuals with cancer and are associated with the development of cancer [21–27]. Standards for the clinical classification of sequence variants established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ( ACMG ) use multiple pieces of evidence ( family history, allele frequency, segregation and functional data, etc. ) to classify sequence variants as either pathogenic ( associated with increased cancer risk ) or benign [28]. Most variants detected in susceptibility screening, however, lack supporting evidence by statistically significant population data to classify them as either pathogenic or benign, resulting in their classification as variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ) [28]. One solution to this problem is to test individual variants using assays for protein function to determine whether each variant is damaging to protein function. Functional analysis can provide supporting evidence for clinical classification of rare variants that otherwise could not be supported by population and family data [11, 28]. Several different functional assays have been used to test individual and small sets of CHK2 missense variants identified in patients, including tests of protein stability, kinase activity toward various substrates, and activation by DNA damaging agents [22, 23, 29–32]. Another method to assay the function of CHK2 variants is to test their ability to complement a yeast RAD53 loss-of-function mutant ( rad53 ). Human CHEK2 was cloned and first tested for its ability to complement yeast rad53 in a complementation growth assay in 1998 [1]. This study also demonstrated that the CHK2 kinase defective mutant, D347A, failed to complement rad53. Yeast rad53 complementation has been used as a method for protein function assessment on several other CHEK2 pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants. For example, the CHEK2 founder mutation, c. 1100delC was tested for complementation of yeast rad53 mutants and no complementation was observed [24]. The same study also showed that a CHEK2 missense variant leading to S428F within the kinase domain does not complement, while a missense variant leading to P85L in the SCD has wildtype-like activity. Additionally, rad53 complementation assays using the DNA damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) have been performed to evaluate the functional impact of over 100 germline missense variants detected in familial breast cancer patients or selected from the ClinVar database [33–35]. Over 2, 700 CHEK2 missense variants, however, have not been tested in a functional assay, including most of the VUS in the ClinVar database. To test the ability of all possible CHEK2 coding SNVs to complement a rad53 mutant, we conducted a version of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) [36, 37]. This technique, also known as a multiplex assay of variant effects ( MAVE ) [38], has become a valuable tool to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on protein function and has been used in several studies to characterize human protein variants based on their function in yeast [39–43]. To carry out a DMS screen. we made a comprehensive library of CHEK2 coding variants using error-prone PCR, screened the library en masse for rad53 complementation, then used next generation sequencing ( NGS ) to identify complementors in the selected yeast. This resulted in testing 4, 885 of the 4, 887 possible CHEK2 SNVs, including all but one of the 3, 913 possible codon changes ( stop, synonymous, or non-synonymous ). This large-scale functional assay of CHK2 variants evaluated the impact of almost every possible SNV in the open reading frame of CHEK2, providing data to aid in the classification of CHEK2 VUS. 
 To construct a library of all possible CHEK2 SNVs, we used error-prone PCR ( EP-PCR ) on the CHEK2 open reading frame ( ORF ) and subcloned the mutagenized ORF into a yeast expression vector ( Methods ). Subsequent next generation sequencing of the library after introduction into yeast revealed an average SNV frequency of 0. 86 ( SD = 0. 46 ) per 1, 000 bp, or 1. 4 SNV per CHEK2 ORF. The distribution of different variants is very similar to that reported for other EP-PCR studies [44]; all transitions and transversions are represented, though T>G and G>C are the rarest and G>A are the most frequent ( S1 Fig ). The frequency of variant detection outside the mutagenized region, but within the sequencing amplicon was substantially lower ( 0. 097 per 1000 nt, SD = 0. 108 ) and followed no significant nucleotide preference. The sequenced library included all but two of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the 543 bp CHEK2 ORF. To screen for CHEK2 variants that retain function we selected yeast transformants that were able to grow in the absence of RAD53 and determined the frequencies of the remaining SNVs by NGS ( Methods ). For each individual SNV, we compared the average frequency before selection ( i. e., in the library ) to the average frequency after selection and calculated a rad53 complementation score ( RCS ) : log2 of the ratio of frequencies after/before selection. Lower ratios or more negative RCSs were interpreted to indicate that the SNVs were depleted after selection as expected for variants that are detrimental to CHK2 function. Globally, 4, 885 of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 ORF could be compared in this way; one SNV was missing from the library, and another was not detected in any of the four independent replicate screens ( S1 Table ). The SNVs that were evaluated represented all but one of the 3, 913 possible unique coding outcomes, including 195 stop codons, 530 synonymous changes, and 3, 187 non-synonymous changes ( S2 Table ). The average RCS for all variants was -0. 94 ( range -7. 30–5. 20 ). To begin to test the assertion that loss of CHEK2 function correlates with screen depletion, we constructed 30 variants and tested their ability to complement rad53 in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS ( Methods ). We found that 770 of the 3, 187 non-synonymous SNVs were depleted in the presence of MMS while 2, 417 were not ( S Table 3 ). The RCS for non-syn SNVs in the presence of MMS were significantly lower than in the absence of M ( p < 0. 0001 ) indicating that these variants were detrimental to function in the presence of DNA damage. The RCS for synonymous SN in the presence of M were not significantly different from those in the absence of M ( p = 0. 6 ) indicating that these were not detrimental in the presence of DNA damage. The RCS for non-s SN in the absence of M were not significantly different from those in the presence of M ( p = 0. 4 ) indicating that these were not detrimental in the absence of DNA damage. The RCS for synonymous in the absence of M were not significantly different from those in the presence M ( p = 0.6 ) indicating that these were not detrimental in the absence of DNA. The RCS for non-s in the presence of M were significantly different from the RCS in the absence ( p < 0.0001 ) indicating that these were detrimental in the presence of DNA. The RCS for synonymous in the presence were not different from the RCS in the ( p =.6 ) indicating that were not in the presence. The RCS for non in the were different from the RCS ( <.1 ) indicating that in the. The RCS for synonymous were not different the (.6 ) that not in. The RCS for non were different (.1 that in.

    Title: 
    Article: Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus. As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies, different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits, but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations. Here, we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e. g., colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ). Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. Phenotypically, moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity. Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. 
 Streptococcus pneumoniae ( the pneumococcus ) is a commensal in the human nasopharynx and also an opportunistic pathogen of invasive infections ( pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis ) [1]. To adapt to diverse host niches, the bacterium employs complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to generate phenotypically heterogeneous subpopulations. In particular, S. pneumoniae is capable of reversible phase variation between the opaque ( O ) and transparent ( T ) colony variants within clonal populations [2, 3]. Both phases possess distinct molecular and pathogenic characteristics. The O variants express a thicker capsule with stronger resistance to host phagocytic clearance. In contrast, the T counterparts produce a thinner capsule displaying higher airway adherence [3–6]. These molecular and structural differences are associated with pneumococcal behaviors in animal models. While the O variants are more prevalent in bloodstream infections, the T counterparts are more dominant in nasopharyngeal colonization [3, 4]. Pneumococcal phase variation in colony opacity is epigenetically determined by reversible DNA inversions in the three DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the Spn556II/SpnD39III type I restriction-modification ( R-M ) system or the colony opacity determinant ( cod ) locus [7–9]. The cod locus contains the hsdR ( restriction endonuclease ), hsdM ( DNA methyltransferase ), psrA or creX ( DNA invertase ), hsdSA ( sequence recognition ), and two transcriptionally silent hsdS genes ( hsdSB and hsdSC ) [7–9]. As a tyrosine recombinase, PsrA catalyzes extensive DNA inversions between hsdSA and the two silent homologs ( hsdSB and hsdSC ) by recognizing the inverted repeats ( IRs ) flanking the invertible sequences. The hsdS inversions generate six bacterial subpopulations, each of which carries a different hsdSA allele ( hsdSA1 to hsdSA6 ) [7, 9, 10]. Each of the six HsdSA subunits drives the N6-methyladenine ( 6-mA ) methylation of a unique sequence motif that is present in many genomic loci, forming a distinct methylome [7, 9]. Phenotypically, only the pneumococci carrying hsdSA1 allele produce O colonies, while the other five hsdSA2-6-carrying variants generate T colonies [7, 9]. Each of the six hsdSA alleles defines a unique transcriptome [7]. Our recent study has shown that the orientations of hsdS inversions in the cod locus and resulting colony phases are subjective to transcriptional regulation by four two-component regulatory systems ( TCSs ) [11]. The absence of these TCSs leads to dramatic loss of hsdSA1-carrying variant and thereby O colonies in the clonal populations. Together, the epigenetic switches driven by hsdS inversions in the cod locus confer S. pneumoniae variable biological characteristics and pathogenetic identities to enhance bacterial adaptation. S. pneumoniae is capable of natural genetic transformation or the competence state to achieve genetic diversity by uptaking and recombining foreign DNA molecules into the genome. The competence state is transiently activated by the ComDE, a two-component system in response to an extracellular competence stimulating peptide ( CSP ) [12]. Exposure to CSP activates the transcription of comX, comW and other early competence genes that are responsible for further activation of the late competence genes for DNA uptake and processing [13, 14]. ComX is the alternative sigma factor that, together with ComW, activates the late competence genes for DNA uptake and processing as a part of natural transformation by binding to the “com box” sequence in the promoter regions of the target genes [13, 15, 16]. There are two identical copies of comX ( comX1 and comX2 ) at two remote loci of pneumococcal genome. The cellular level of ComX is stabilized by ComW against otherwise rapid degradation by the ClpP protease [17]. Our previous study has shown that ComW, but not the two-component system ComDE, is required for stabilizing the hsdSA1 allelic configuration in the cod locus by an uncharacterized mechanism [11]. The toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) systems consist of stable toxins and labile antitoxins, and widely exist in bacteria [18]. Toxins inhibit bacterial growth by targeting essential cellular processes, whereas antitoxins neutralize the activities of cognate toxins at the levels of transcription, translation, activity or stability under steady-state conditions. Under the conditions when toxins are outnumbered by antitoxins, the toxic activity of the toxins is unleashed. Based on the nature of the antitoxin and the mode of interaction between the toxin and antitoxin, TA systems are currently classified into eight types, in which the type II TA systems are the most prevalent [19]. A typical type II TA system consists of toxins and antitoxins both in protein form, whose encoding genes are organized as an operon. In the most cases, type II toxins target protein synthesis by degrading mRNAs or tRNAs, impairing aminoacylation of tRNA and inactivating elongation factor [20–22]. While up to 10 type II TA systems are bioinformatically predicted in S. pneumoniae [23], only a few TA systems are characterized [19]. RelBE, YefMB and HicBA appear to target pneumococcal translation, whereas the PezT toxin of the PezAT system inhibits cell wall synthesis [19, 24]. In this study, we have serendipitously discovered a new type II toxin-antitoxin system in S. pneumoniae, SpxA1-TenA system, which was not included in the previously predicted type II TA systems [19]. The tenA ( toxin ) and spxA1 ( antitoxin ) genes are co-transcribed as an operon. The balance of the SpxA1-TenA system is controlled at the transcriptional level by the variable length of the AT dinucleotide repeat ( AT-rich ) region upstream of the spxA1-tenA promoter. Excessive TenA profoundly affects pneumococcal biology in DNA methyltransferase hsdS gene configuration, genome methylation pattern and the resultant colony phase. 
 Our previous study has showed that two-component system TCS06, consisting of the sensing kinase HK06 and response regulator RR06, regulates pneumococcal methylome and the resulting phase switch between opaque ( O ) and transparent ( T ) colonies within clonal populations [11]. During that work, an rr06 deletion mutant Δrr06 ( TH9164 ) produced significantly more T than O colonies, but the phenotype could not be genetically complemented with an intact rr06 in the complementation strain Δrr06rev-N ( TH9551 ) ( Fig 1A ). The in situ replenishment did not change the T colony dominance. This indicated that other gene ( s ) beyond rr06 were involved in colony formation. Genome sequencing identified a four-nucleotide 5’-ATAT-3’ insertion in the promoter region of the sp1A-ten operon in Δrr ( TH4 ) ( Fig 1B ).

    Title: 
    Article: High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena. 
 Investigators in the biological sciences are increasingly collecting high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze, with modalities ranging from imaging to electrophysiology to single-cell RNA sequencing. Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal components analysis ( PCA ) and its many variants [1–5] are used widely to help simplify these datasets and facilitate analysis. PCA examines the covariance structure of the data to find dimensions that account for more variance than chance; these constitute patterns that are overrepresented in the data, such as assemblies of neurons whose activity fluctuates up and down together across time in a neural recording [6–9], or networks of genes that are up- or down-regulated together across cells in a single-cell RNAseq dataset [10, 11]. However, in many cases, the goal is to compare data collected under two different experimental conditions, which we refer to here as datasets. Since PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques operate on only one dataset, they cannot take experimental conditions into account. The most common approach for comparing two high-dimensional datasets is linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) [12] or its multidimensional analog, partial least squares discriminant analysis [13]. These methods find dimensions that optimally distinguish one dataset from the other, which could correspond to which neurons fire more, or which genes are upregulated, in condition A vs. condition B. However, an analogous method to compare the covariance structure of two datasets is not as well established. This addresses more subtle and detailed questions, such as which subsets of neurons exhibit increased temporal correlations in condition A than B, or which subsets of genes are more likely to be up- or downregulated together in individual cells in condition A than B. Mathematically, answering these questions corresponds to finding dimensions that account for more variance in A than in B ( S1A Fig ). Recently, contrastive PCA ( cPCA ) was proposed as a method to address this problem [14]. Although cPCA is an important first step, it requires a hyperparameter α, which controls how much covariance from the second condition to subtract from the first. The algorithm must therefore iterate over multiple choices of α with no objective criteria to determine which value of α yields the correct answer. Moreover, cPCA is asymmetric, identifying the most enriched dimensions in the first condition after subtracting out the second condition as background; it cannot treat the two experimental conditions equally. Here we propose a novel solution to these problems we call generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ). We first demonstrate the role the α hyperparameter plays in cPCA, then explain our strategy for eliminating it. We then describe an open source toolbox for Python and MATLAB implementing several versions of gcPCA with different objective functions that are either asymmetric or symmetric, orthogonal or non-orthogonal, or sparse or dense, tailored to suit the specific application at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in the analysis of diverse biological datasets. 
 Our motivation for the following method stems from eliminating the necessity of the free parameter α in the contrastive PCA method. To accomplish this, we introduce a normalization factor to mitigate the bias toward high-variance dimensions. We will summarize the process of calculating the gcPCs using gcPCA v4. 0 as an example, but v2 and v3 are analogous. gcPCA v4. 0 has the following objective function, as shown in equation ( eq. 1 ) :arg max ⁡ x:x⊺x=1x⊺ ( CA-CB ) xx⊺ ( CA+CB ) x ( 1 ) A potential problem of this objective function is the denominator creating numerical instability if the denominator covariance matrix has eigenvectors with eigenvalues equal to ( or sufficiently close to ) zero. This can occur either if the features are strongly correlated or if the data is rank-deficient, e. g. scRNA-seq data containing fewer cells than genes or two-photon imaging data containing fewer frames than pixels. To address this, we consider only the principal subspace of the covariances matrices, i. e. the subspace spanned by eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues. To project the matrices into this subspace, we first make a projection matrix J composed of the first k principal components of the row-wise concatenated datasets A and B, where k is chosen so that the principal components that are effectively zero due to limited numerical precision are excluded from the analysis. We then substitute x using x = Jγ, yielding:arg max ⁡ γ:γ⊺γ=1γ⊺J⊺ ( CA-CB ) Jγγ⊺J⊺ ( CA+CB ) Jγ ( 2 ) J guarantees that J⊺ ( CA+CB ) J in the denominator is positive definite, allowing us to find a symmetric matrix M that is its square root, yielding equation ( eq. 3 ) :arg max ⁡ γ:γ⊺γ=1γ⊺J⊺ ( CA-CB ) Jγγ⊺M⊺Mγ ( 3 ) Let y = Mγ, yielding:arg max ⁡ y:y⊺y=1y⊺M-1J⊺ ( CA-CB ) JM-1yy⊺y ( 4 ) This optimization problem can be solved with the eigendecomposition of the numerator matrix to find Y. The vectors in X are then calculated using equation ( eq. 5 ) :X=JM-1Y ( 5 ) The column vectors in X are referred to as gcPCs, following the term cPCs used in [14]. The other versions of gcPCA can be solved in the exact same way, by replacing CA-CB with CA ( v2 ) or replacing CA+CB with CB ( v2 and v3 ). The core idea of gcPCA, as described above, is to use JM-1 to map the numerator ( CA-CB ) from the original feature space into a weighted inner product space that is weighted by the inverse of the denominator. This warps the space so that the variance in ( CA+CB ) is equal in all directions. This is directly analogous to the whitening transformation used to calculate Mahalanobis distances, but instead of calculating distances, we diagonalize M-1J⊺ ( CA-CB ) JM-1 to find the gcPCs. Consequently, the gcPCs are orthogonal in this normalized feature space, not the original feature space. To calculate gcPCs that are orthogonal in the original feature space, we first take the largest eigenvector of X as the first gcPC. We then apply an orthogonality constraint by iteratively deflating matrix J to remove the subspace spanned by the gcPCs ( i. e. columns of X ) that have already been found. At each step, we compute the eigenvector x of equation 4 with either the smallest or largest eigenvalue ( alternating between them ), then project it into the feature space with equation 5 and concatenate it column-wise into the growing matrix X. To deflate J, we first regress out the x from J, as shown in equation 6:J^=J-xx⊺J ( 6 ) We then use SVD to get the left singular vectors of J^, and we define J~ as the first n–i of these ( on the i-th iteration ). J~ serves as an orthonormal basis for the subspace of J that is orthogonal to the columns of X that have already been calculated, and we use J~ as the new J in eq. 2 for the next iteration. This process continues until k gcPCs are found, which can be the number of features in the dataset, the minimum rank of the conditions, or a number specified by the user. We developed an extension for sparse gcPCA by using a similar approach to sparse PCA [3] and sparse cPCA [15]. We will first review the sparse PCA framework, then explain how we adapt it for gcPCA. In the synthetic data, we generated two conditions with 1×105 samples and 100 dimensions. The dimensions were sampled from a Gaussian distribution ( mu = 0 and sigma = 1 ) and then orthogonalized using singular value decomposition and picking the left singular vectors. In each condition, we added a subset of the dimensions to be highly correlated with each other, e.g. dimensions 1–10 and 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, 81, 91–100. The remaining dimensions were uncorrelated to each other and to the correlated dimensions. We then added noise to the data with variance 0. 1 and 0 0. 5 and 1. We applied gcPCA to the data and compared the results with cPCA and PCA. The results are shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2. In fig.1, we see that gcPCs capture the correlated dimensions better than cPCs and PCA. In fig.2, we see that gcPCs are more robust to noise than cPC and PCA. We also see that gcPCs are more sparse than cPC and PCA. We also tested gcPCA on a real dataset of single-cell RNA-seq data from type II diabetes patients and healthy controls. We applied gcPCA to the data and compared the results with cPCA and PCA. The results are shown in fig.3 and fig.4. In fig., we see that gcPC capture the heterogeneity of type II diabetes better than cPC and PCA. In fig., we see that gcPC are more robust to noise than c and PCA. We also see that gc are more sparse than c and PCA. We also tested gcPCA on a dataset of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings. We applied gc to the data and compared the results with c and PCA. The results are shown fig. and fig. In fig, we see that gc capture hippocamp replay better than c and PCA. In fig, we see that gc are more robust than and PCA. We see that gc are more sparse than and PCA. We conclude that gc is a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional biological data. It is fast, robust, and easy-to-use, and provides insights into complex phenomena.

    Title: 
    Article: B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1, OCI-LY3 ), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring. 
 Intracellular signaling pathways are central to the communication of a cell with its environment, and control many important cellular processes and fates. These pathways are often activated by ligands that bind to cognate cell surface receptors and activate a specific set of intracellular proteins, often by tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation. In many disease contexts, these pathways are deregulated, for instance by mutations in key signaling proteins. Consequently, activation can occur independent of ligands or stimuli. Signaling pathways are embedded into complex networks with feedback and crosstalk. It is therefore difficult to predict how these networks change when a pathway is chronically activated, and how the pathway reacts upon targeted interference. Mathematical modeling of intracellular pathways based on systematic perturbation data is a valuable approach to disentangle the difference in signaling networks of ligand/stimuli-induced pathways vs. chronic ( aberrant ) active pathways. A better understanding of the interactions of chronically activated signaling pathways is important to improve the prediction and further design of targeted therapies. B cell receptor signaling represents a network for which the extend of feedback and crosstalk still remains unclear. Furthermore, a better dissection of chronic vs. acute signaling will support our understanding of related diseases. In normal B cells, the pathway is triggered by antigens, but is chronically activated in specific sets of Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma ( NHL ). In normal physiology the binding of a specific antigen to the B cell receptor complex leads to a very fast rebuilding and recruitment of a number of proximal signaling molecules including the ITAM motif molecules CD79A/B, the kinases LYN/SYK and SLP65/Btk/PI3K [1–3]. The activated BCR subsequently recruits multiple downstream signaling molecules and pathways, some of which include those dependent upon phospholipase Cγ, Protein kinase C or RAF-MAPK, PI3K, GSK3, MTOR and NF-kB. In addition, also JNK and p38MAPK are activated downstream of the BCR [4]. These pathways converge in the activation of a set of different transcription factors controlling B cell proliferation and survival, including c-Myc, NF-AT, Elk1, c-Jun and ATF2 ( 4–6 ). In human B cells the activation of the key signaling pathway RAF/MEK/ERK by BCR seems to be similar to the activation by receptor tyrosine kinases ( Satpathy et al., 2015; Vanshylla et al., 2018 ) [5, 6]. This signal transduction network downstream of the B cell receptor ( BCR ) has received much attention, as it is a major regulator in adaptive immunity [7–10]. It has been shown that the relative activity of the multiple pathways downstream of BCR determines the outcome of BCR signaling [11]. The activity of the BCR is important for the expansion and survival and can be supported by both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms [12]. Compelling evidence is provided that in different NHL subtypes aberrant BCR signaling activation is important [9, 13–19]. BCR signaling is often studied in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines [5, 6, 12, 20, 21]. While the EGFR-signaling network or the T cell receptor pathway have been quantitatively studied in many contexts, the BCR signaling and its oncogenic variations have so far only gained limited attention. Elaborated network models of EGFR and T cell signaling include proximal and distal elements but also feedback loops [2, 22–28]. Some of these models discovered and quantified pathway interactions and feedback loops, which have important implications also for clinical applications. These include positive feedback loops that strengthen the therapeutic success and negative feedback loops that lead to adverse events or even therapeutic failure [26, 29–32]. For example, the somewhat disappointing response rates to drugs targeting the intracellular RAS/MAPK pathway could be explained by strong negative feedbacks [26, 33]. Now it is becoming more and more clear that also in BCR signaling the signal is propagated through a complex context-dependent network. The complexity of this signaling network is also characterized by an interplay of RAF/MEK/ERK, JNK, p38, NF-kB and PI3K, originally described as parallel pathways of activation. However, there is a substantial crosstalk between these different downstream signaling molecules not yet characterized in sufficient detail. Reaching a better level of understanding will allow to answer questions such as whether these crosstalks are cell type specific and thus account in part for the differential activity of BCR and its functional outcome, but can also unveil therapeutic opportunities. The few existing BCR signaling models are mostly deterministic models that include BCR signal propagation by a specific set of network nodes [23, 24, 34, 35]. The models cover both membrane proximal, early signaling events and to some extend downstream signaling events. Furthermore, a detailed model of the feedback loops involving LYN and SYK incorporating every phosphorylation event for six proximal signaling components has been established [34]. However, an exhaustive quantitative modeling of downstream pathways is currently missing. A previous study [36] attempted to infer an oncogenic signaling network in aggressive lymphoma cell lines indirectly from gene expression data following signaling perturbations using the Boolean Nested Effects Modeling ( B-NEM ) approach. By this simple modeling approach, an acyclic network with only activating interactions was derived which contained no feedbacks and lacked quantitative information. While such models help to gain the understanding of pathway interactions, they are not suitable for simulations or quantitative model comparisons. To get a more fine-grained semi-quantitative understanding of the signaling network, we therefore decided to employ a modeling approach on the more information rich readout of phosphorylation data after systematic pathway perturbations which contains more predictive power [37]. We have previously developed an approach termed STeady-STate Analysis of Signaling Networks ( STASNet ) that is based on Modular Response Analysis ( MRA ) [38] and applied this tool to decipher EGFR/RAS signaling in different tumors [26, 39–42] as well as to compare mouse embryonic stem cells with different sex chromosome compositions [43]. The main concept of MRA is that the measurable global response matrix R ( e. g., log fold changes of steady state measurements before and after systematic single node perturbations for every node of the network ) theoretically contains the information to derive the so-called local response r, a matrix whose non-zero entries quantify the edges of the underlying network structure which are called local response coefficients ( see Material and Methods ). A positive and negative response coefficient encodes for an increase or decrease of the downstream node’s activity, respectively, where |r| > 1 amplifies, |r| < 1 dampens and |r| = 1 neutrally relays the upstream signal. In STASNet we adapted the MRA theory to real world applications to account for ( 1 ) measurement noise using a maximum likelihood and model selection strategy and ( 2 ) incomplete perturbation and measurement designs by adding a non-identifiability analysis before parameter fitting [39]. Due to the latter, we summarize non-identifiable response coefficients into identifiable combinations thereof, and term those ‘coefficient paths’. The advantage of the MRA approach is that it allows to model and identify feedback loops that are known to play a crucial role in conferring robustness, shaping the signaling dynamics or integrating multiple converging signals and thus are vital to consider when searching for drug combinations eligible for targeted therapeutics. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous Boolean approach, STASNet allows to semi-quantitatively ( on steady state change level ) compare signaling networks and to predict simulations across cell line models. Based on systematic perturbation data we developed an MRA-based network model for acute signaling in a Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cell line BL-2. We show that this model is transferable to perturbation data of another BL cell line BL-41. This supports the view that our model reflects common elements of intracellular signaling of acute B-cell signaling. Additional phosphoproteomic analyses of selected interventions support key insights of this model. After establishing these quantitative network models, we found that the network of BL-2 was also suited to model signaling in diffuse large B cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling ( HBL-1, OCIY3 ) indicating that B aberration does not cause a major rewiring of intracellular pathways.

    Title: 
    Article: The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. 
 The ancient and highly conserved Notch receptor signalling pathway is indispensable for embryonic and post-embryonic tissue growth and development [1, 2]. It is formed of large ( approximately 300 kDa ) single pass cell membrane receptors, and ligands which can also be expressed at the cell surface. The overall size, structure and known function of these core receptor/ligand components has remained relatively unchanged over evolutionary time although the number of Notch receptor and ligand family members encoded by different genera varies, for example, invertebrates such as Drosophila possess a single type of Notch receptor controlled by two distinct ligands, whilst vertebrates express up to four distinct receptor paralogues ( Notch1–4 ) and five different ligands: Jagged ( JAG ) 1, JAG2, Delta-Like ( DLL ) 1, DLL3, and DLL4 [3]. Uniquely amongst cell surface receptors, Notch itself can directly activate gene transcription as part of a DNA-bound activation complex, a signal triggered via a trans interaction between the extracellular domain of the receptor and Notch ligands expressed by neighbouring cells. Upon ligand binding, the resultant biomechanical strain/pulling forces cause structural changes which expose specific enzyme cleavage sites in the membrane-proximal region of the receptor [4–8]. Subsequently, a defined series of proteolytic events terminates in the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain [9, 10], which translocates to the nucleus whereupon it stimulates expression of Notch target genes [11, 12]. An important counterbalance to Notch signalling transactivation is a regulatory mechanism termed cis-inhibition by which ligands block the activity of receptors expressed in the same cell [13–15]. Thus, in this view, the net receptor signalling output is determined by the relative ‘strength’ of these two counterposed processes ( transactivation and cis-inhibition ). Whilst, the basic features of Notch receptor transactivation, outlined above, have been delineated in some detail, a number of fundamental issues remain enigmatic. One question relates to the precise nature and significance of cis inhibition and how it counteracts receptor transactivation. Another central question concerns how the manifold potential receptor-ligand combinations will give rise to the different signalling outputs necessary for tissue patterning. In this context, recent work has dissected, at the molecular level, the cellular responses to different ligands, which can stimulate either discrete pulses of Notch activity ( in the case of DLL1 ) or a sustained period of signalling ( in the case of DLL4 ) yielding distinct gene expression outcomes [16, 17]. At the tissue level, a classic example of the divergent roles of different Notch ligands is found during sprouting angiogenesis wherein DLL4 was shown to constrain sprouting opposed by the pro-angiogenic properties of JAG1 [18, 19]. Of significant interest, in this in vivo setting, was the notion that JAG1 functions by antagonizing the activity of DLL4, highlighting the possibility of crosstalk/competition between the ligands, though the specific molecular details have not been elucidated. In this light, other potential facets of Notch signalling merit consideration. For instance, in the absence of available evidence, is has been generally assumed that cis and trans receptor/ligand interactions are essentially monomeric in nature, and involve binding of one species of ligand and a single species of receptor rather than complexes of different receptor types, or different ligand types. There are, however, reasons to suppose that the actual picture may be more complicated. Both receptors and ligands harbour multiple EGF-like repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions [20], and we here recently shown that homomeric DLL4 ligand complexes could promote cis inhibition of Notch receptor activity [15]. Moreover, the fact that all Notch ligands share a common overall architecture raises the possibility of a potential biological role for heteromeric ligand complex formation, up to now, a mechanism which has not been reported. In this study, we combine experimental approaches and mathematical modelling to explore the molecular control of Notch1 receptor activity by the ligands, DLL4 and JAG1. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role for heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complexes, which could enable angiogenic sprouting by regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tips cells and trailing stalk cells. 
 To test the relative Notch receptor transactivation potential of the ligands DLL4 and JAG1, we performed quantitative reporter assays. Fig 1A shows that whilst DLL4 ( and JAG2 ) efficiently promoted Notch1 transactivation, JAG1 was unable to elicit detectable Notch1 transactivation. Conversely, Fig 1B shows that JAG1 could induce transactivation of Notch2 and Notch3 suggesting that the transactivation block is specific to Notch1. To elucidate a possible molecular basis of this difference we assessed binding of the ligands to Notch receptors expressed at the cell surface. Fig 1C and 1D show that DLL4, but not JAG1, bound relatively efficiently to Notch1 ( Fig 1C ). In contrast to its lack of binding to Notch1, JAG1 efficiently associated with both Notch2 and Notch3 ( Fig 1D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that DLL4, can bind to and effectively trigger Notch1 receptor transactivation, whereas JAG1 fails to bind to the Notch1 receptor with sufficiently high affinity to elicit robust receptor transactivation. We next explored the respective roles of DLL4 and JAG1 in Notch1 cis inhibition. Fig 2A shows that DLL4, as expected, potently blocked transactivation of Notch1 when both Notch1 and DLL4 are expressed in the same cell ( cis inhibition; see [13] ). By comparison, JAG1 could not similarly induce strong ( cis ) inhibition of Notch1 signalling ( Fig 2A ), whereas the closely related JAG2 ligand, in common with DLL4, promoted strong cis inhibition of Notch1 activity. We have previously shown that DLL4-dependent cis inhibition of Notch activity requires ligand dimerization/oligomerization ( herein referred to simply as dimerization ) [15]. In this light, we compared DLL4, JAG2 and JAG1 ligand dimerization. In agreement with our prior observations, both DLL4 and JAG2 could biochemically self-associate, however, JAG1 could not detectably form homodimers, which could explain the observed differences in their relative effectiveness in Notch1 receptor cis inhibition ( Fig 2B ). The difference between JAG1 and JAG2 was particularly surprising since they display a high degree of overall structural similarity. Indeed, the only significant difference between the two ligands is a von Willebrand factor type C ( VWFC ) domain located in the juxtamembrane region of the JAG2 extracellular domain ( Fig 2C ). Two lines of evidence support the idea that homodimer formation by DLL4 and JAG2 is a prerequisite for full Notch1 cis inhibition, and that JAG1 cannot induce full Notch1 cis inhibition because it cannot form homodimers. First, deletion of the JAG2 VWFC domain blocked homodimer formation ( Fig 2D ). This is consistent with previous studies which have shown, for different proteins, that the VWFC domain can mediate protein oligomerization [21]. Thus, in the absence of the VWFC domain, with respect to ligand self-association, JAG2 exhibits biochemical characteristics comparable to JAG1. Second, deletion of the JAG2 VWFC domain abrogated JAG2-dependent cis inhibition of Notch1 to a degree comparable to JAG1 ( Fig 2E ). It is notable that in contrast to the relatively weak trans Notch1-JAG1 binding, JAG1 can bind relatively efficiently to Notch1 in cis ( see S1 Fig ), consistent with the view that J1 can form a heteromeric JAG/DLL complex with Not1. We propose a model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis ( Fig 3 ). In this model, DLL4 binds to Not1 at the cell surface and triggers transactivation, whereas J1 forms a heteromeric JAG/DLL complex with Not1 in the same cell to block cis-inhibit Notch signalling. The heteromeric JAG/DLL complex prevents DLL-dependent cis-inhibition of Not signalling, allowing DLL4 to elicit robust transactivation of Not1. The heterom JAG/DLL complex is necessary for the differentiation of endothelial cells into tip and stalk cells, which are necessary for angiogenic sprouting. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Notch signalling and highlights the importance of heteromeric ligand complexes in the regulation of Notch receptor activity. 
The Notch signalling pathway plays a crucial role in embryonic and postembryonic tissue growth and development. It is formed of a large receptor and ligands which can be expressed at the cell surface. The structure and function of these core receptorlig components has remained relatively unchanged over time, although the number of Notch and ligand family members varies between species. Notch can directly activate transcription as part of a DNA-bound complex, triggered by interaction between the extracellular domain of the receptor and ligands expressed by neighbouring cells. A counter to Not signalling is cis inhibition by ligands that block the activity of receptors in the same cell. The net signalling output is determined by the relative strength of these counter processes. The nature and significance of cis inhibition and how it counteracts receptor activation are enigmatic. This study explores the molecular basis of Notch activity by ligands DLL and J1 which control angiogenic sprouting. A combination of approaches and modelling provide evidence that two mechanisms underpin this process : 1 ) DLL rather than J1 induces Notch receptor activation ; 2 J1 blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition of Not signalling through the formation of J1/DLL complex. A new model of Not signalling recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting.

    Title: 
    Article: Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields, with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction. Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error, but this is rarely used to inform the clustering. We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data. We cluster immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures. We first introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this, DPMUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined. We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures, and clustering these patients using DPMUnc. 
 Grouping items by similarity has a variety of applications in bioinformatics. For example, clustering samples according to any molecular measures may help to identify subgroups of disease [1, 2]. In gene expression data, clustering the genes may be useful for inferring gene function using guilt by association and inferring regulatory relationships [3]. Clustering can also be used to cluster diseases themselves. For example, immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) have been shown to have a shared genetic basis such that IMD can be clustered according to those shared patterns [4, 5]. Commonly used methods, such as k-means [6, 7] and mclust [8], assume that the observations being clustered are observed without error, or that any errors are identically distributed. In reality we often have not just data points themselves but also a measure of uncertainty about each observation which has the potential to improve clustering accuracy if exploited. Examples include data generated by multiple uncertain experts [9], network clustering where edges have an associated score indicating uncertainty, or the cell type annotation problem in single-cell multiomic data, where different omics layers may assign cells to different clusters. In this work, we focus on quantitative data with associated uncertainty, which may arise for example with random measurement error or the use of summary measures such as the average of three blood pressure readings. To be clear, clustering methods already capture one source of uncertainty as the cluster variance, which describes variability in the location of different objects in the same cluster. Here, when we discuss uncertainty, we will focus on uncertainty attached to each observation, which may vary between observations and/or features. In this case, cluster variance would describe the variability of location of the latent observations which can be thought to represent the “true” locations of the objects whose location we have observed with some measured uncertainty. A variety of methods have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in observations when clustering, including calculating distance between observations accounting for uncertainty [10], clustering representative objects sampled from the distribution associated with each uncertain observation [11, 12], and adapting the likelihood by integrating over the distribution associated with each uncertain observation [13]. Within clustering approaches generally, the Bayesian methods offer some advantages, in their ability to convey uncertainty about the overall clustering, and particularly to simultaneously infer the number of clusters, K. Here, we propose to adapt a standard model for a Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture model to the setting where the data points have associated uncertainty, “Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ) ”. Such adaptation has not been explored previously, to the best of our knowledge. We show that accounting for uncertainty can alter the clustering solution returned and demonstrate its performance on a range of simulated datasets and real applications. First, we consider clustering IMD using GWAS summary statistics, a problem where the uncertainty associated with each observation generally varies systematically with study sample size. Second, we cluster patients with IMD using gene expression data which can help identify subtypes of disease or predict response to treatment [2]. However, clustering on all ∼20, 000 genes can be computationally expensive, and may group patients by disease-irrelevant structure, such as sex or age. Investigations of gene expression in relation to disease or biological processes sometimes produce a gene signature, a list of genes with a shared pattern of gene expression which is relevant to the disease or process. We propose a summary measure of a gene signature, which captures average signature expression and its variance, and show that DPMUnc allows patients to be clustered according to one or more signatures. 
 Our approach follows previous work [14], extended to include both the observations xi, i = 1…n and their respective uncertainty estimates σ i 2. We model these xi as noisy observations of some latent variables zi: x i ∼ N ( z i, σ i 2 ). The latent variables themselves are modelled as coming from a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model ( DPGMM ). We follow the approach of [15], which takes the infinite limit of a Gaussian Mixture Model and can be shown to be equivalent to using Dirichlet Processes directly [15, 16]. In a finite Gaussian Mixture Model the points are generated from K clusters, where points within each cluster are i. i. d. Gaussian variables with some mean μk and variance ρ k 2: z i | c i = k ∼ N ( μ k, ρ k 2 ) where the indicator variables ci show which cluster a variable belongs to. We give these indicator variables a standard categorical distribution with the weights for each category πk having a Dirichlet prior: p ( c i = k ) = π k ;π 1, …, π K∼ Dirichlet ( α / K, …, α / K ) where ∑ k = 1 K π k = 1. Finally, we define priors α ∼ Gamma ( a 0, b 0 ) μ k, ρ k 2 ∼ Normal-Inverse Gamma ( μ 0, κ 0, α 0, β 0 ) where a0 = 3, b0 = 4, μ0 is the empirical mean of the observed data and α0, β0, κ0 are hyperparameters that should be adjusted according to the spread of the data and the expected cluster structure. Some further discussion of how these values may be chosen is given in the S1 Text. The joint density factorises as follows: p ( c, x, z, π, μ, ρ, α ) = p ( ϕ ) p ( c | π ) p ( π | α ) p ( α ) ∏ i p ( x i | σ i 2, z i ) p ( z i | ϕ c i ) ( 1 ) as represented in Fig 1. We now let K tend to infinity, yielding a Gaussian Mixture Model with no constraint on the number of clusters which is equivalent to a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model [15, 16]. We use a Gibbs sampling algorithm to sample from the posterior p ( c | x, σ 2 ) according to the conditional probability distributions as set out in S1 Text and as described in S1 Fig. This model is stated for univariate data but can easily be extended for multivariate data, using the assumption that dimensions are independent and have the same distribution, so that the same hyperparameters can be used for every dimension. For multivariate data with p dimensions, the variables xi, zi, μk and ρ k 2 would all be p-dimensional vectors and the corresponding distributions set out in the S1 Text may be used to sample each dimension independently. To more directly compare the effect of adjusting for the uncertainty of the points, we also run DPMUnc with adjusted versions of the datasets where the observations themselves were untouched, but the uncertainty estimates were shrunk to 0. Thus the rest of the DPMUnc works as normal, but the latent variables are essentially fixed to be equal to the observed data points throughout and so the only difference compared to DPMUnc is that no adjustment for uncertainty takes place. We call this version of the method DPMZeroUnc. We first used simulated data to explore the effects of differing levels of uncertainty associated with each observation and noise around each cluster location on DPMUnc. Detailed discussion of two illustrative examples is presented in the S1 Text. Briefly, we found that including estimates of uncertainty tended to produce solutions with smaller cluster variances, and with cluster means corresponding to a weighted mean of observations, in which observations with lower uncertainty were given greater weight, rather than unweighted means when uncertainty was ignored. We then compared the performance of DPMUnc to a variety of clustering approaches which either do not account for uncertainty in observations: or do account for uncertainty: DPMUnc outperformed its comparators by a small margin when observation noise and cluster variance were low, and by a larger margin when noise and variance were high. Next, we applied DUnc to IMD using GWAS summary statistics which have uncertainty associated with the sample size of the study. DPM separated autoimmune diseases from other subgroups such as adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis. We then applied DUnc to gene expression data from patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures and found association between disease and clusters returned by DUnc with structure replicated across datasets. Finally, we proposed a procedure for summarising a gene signature on a dataset different to where it was discovered, incorporating a measure of variability in expression across genes within each individual. We used this procedure to summarise three gene datasets containing patients with a range of IMD and found association between disease and clusters returned DUnc with structure replicated across datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has uncertainty, uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and present a method which does, DUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets than where they were defined and show the value of this by summarising gene expression from patients with IMD using relevant signatures and clustering DUnc.

    Title: 
    Article: Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system. One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture. While this problem has been widely documented, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple, artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision. 
 Rapid advances in deep learning have created new opportunities to understand brain function [1–5]. Deep neural networks can now be trained to perform tasks like image classification or language generation at a higher level than any other model class and, in sufficiently narrow settings, they can even outperform humans [6, 7]. For neuroscientists who aim to explain how the brain gives rise to behavior, having models that can perform behaviors at this level of complexity is a crucial advantage [1]. In addition, deep neural networks were once inspired by and take their name from the biological neural networks studied by neuroscientists and therefore retain some similarity to the brain: they are made up from simple computational units that are connected in complex ways. Therefore, deep networks can express both mid-level hypotheses about what functions individual units compute and how they have to be connected, and high-level hypotheses about how experience ( in the form of training data and learning rules ) shapes processing [5]. This approach has been remarkably successful, especially in modeling visual processing, where deep networks have been used to predict cortical representations with high accuracy [8–10] and even to generate artificial stimuli to control responses in target neurons [11]. A key criticism of using deep networks as models in neuroscience is that their performance may be deceptive [12]. Even though a deep network may assign similar labels to images as a human participant in an experiment, it may use entirely different mechanisms and strategies to do so. While deep networks share some similarities with visual cortex, the latter makes use of many structural design principles that have not yet been adopted in deep networks, such as feedback connections or lateral grouping [13]. Indeed, several lines of evidence indicate that deep networks process images very differently from humans: they are susceptible to adversarial attacks [14, 15], less robust to image corruptions [6, 16], and do not show evidence of perceptual grouping phenomena that play key roles in human perception [12]. One key difference between human vision and deep networks is that humans strongly rely on shape when judging which category an object belongs to, whereas neural networks preferentially rely on texture [17, 18] and similar surface-level properties [19]. In fact, networks seem to be largely unable to process the global shape of objects in a human-like manner [19–21]. The recently formulated “neuroconnectionist” research strategy [5] views these differences not as a fundamental problem, but as an opportunity to investigate directions of further improvement. If we can understand why shape processing differs so drastically between deep networks and human vision, we may gain insight into the components and mechanisms that are required for human-like shape understanding. Evidence for a lack of shape processing in deep networks comes from several lines of research ( see [21] for a review ). While deep networks are able to use some shape information, e. g., to classify silhouettes, they are relatively unaffected by image distortions that disrupt global shape, such as scrambling of silhouette parts [17, 22]. When shape and another property, such as color [19] or even the intensity of a single pixel [23], are equally predictive of image class, deep networks typically learn to use the other feature. Similarly, networks trained on natural images exhibit a “texture bias” [18]. When these networks are tested on cue conflict images, i. e., stylized images which have the shape of one class ( e. g., the outline of a cat ) with the texture of a different class ( e. g., resembling elephant skin ), networks choose the class of the texture in the vast majority of cases [18]. This phenomenon of texture bias on cue conflict images has received considerable attention in the machine learning literature and several methods have been proposed to mitigate it. These include explicit training on stylized images [18], stronger image augmentations [24], and adding custom network components [25]. However, increasing shape bias on cue conflict images may not automatically lead to human-like shape processing—it is only one out of several relevant metrics [21]. As a case in point, networks trained on stylized images to have a high shape bias seem to remain unable to process global object shape [20, 22]. Although the shape bias of neural networks has been documented extensively, there is not yet a clear explanation for why it arises. However, two candidate hypotheses can be distilled from the literature: However, each of these hypotheses leaves something to be explained. In the case of shortcut learning, the original question—why networks rely on texture rather than shape—is replaced by another question: why is recognizing textures easier to learn for deep networks than recognizing shape? Conversely, if there is a deficiency in current network architectures, what is it? Which component is missing exactly and how would it enable shape processing? These questions are difficult to answer, because shape and texture are ill-defined concepts, at least in natural images. We may know intuitively what the shape of a cat is and we may be able to recognize it in an image, but since we lack a formal definition of the “cat-shapedness” of an image, we cannot test whether a network computes “cat-shapedness”. Several techniques have been used to manipulate shape and texture in natural images, such as stylization [18], use of silhouettes [17], and shape scrambling [17, 22]. This can be used to probe selectivity for shape and texture experimentally. However, none of these techniques is perfect, since each alteration in shape also has an effect on textures and vice versa [21]. One way to solve this issue is to use artificial images, in which shapes and textures are generated parametrically and can therefore be controlled exactly. For example, [19] generated images in which colorful patches formed simple shapes. They compared how well humans and neural networks could learn to distinguish categories that depended on different features such as shape, color of object segments, or color of a single patch. While humans relied strongly on shape, networks preferentially classified images by other features, such as color or average size. Here, we follow a similar approach but focus on the question why deep networks fail to learn shape-based classification. We design artificial image datasets in which simple shape, color, or texture features determine which class an object belongs to. We use these datasets in a series of four experiments to test the two hypotheses. First, by training and testing the networks on different feature combinations, we show that a variety of networks exhibit the same biases towards color and texture as on natural images. Second, we show that some of these networks fail to learn the classification at all when they are trained from scratch on a dataset where shape is the only available feature, indicating that there is an architectural deficiency ( hypothesis 2 ). However, even networks that are able to learn shape-based classification in isolation fail to do so when another feature ( color or texture ) is available, consistent with shortcut learning ( hypothesis 1 ). Third, to understand how this bias against shape arises during learning, we analyze the dynamics and structure of the neural tangent kernel ( NTK ) [26] of networks during training. We compare the NTK of a network during training to reference kernels of networks with known feature selectivity and show that the direction of gradient updates is more aligned with color and texture features than with shape. To understand how this alignment arises, we analyze the structure of the NTK. Specifically, we identify groups of images which are similar to each other according to the similarity function expressed by the neural tangent kernel. This means that the network outputs for these images are related: changing how the network responds to one image will also affect how it responds to the others. Finally, we examine whether images in these groups tend to belong to the same class. We find that this is the case for NTKs of color- and texture-sensitive networks, but not of shape-sensitive networks. We hypothesize that such groups dominate the dynamics of gradient descent learning, explaining why networks are biased to color and texture. Fourth, we show that reducing the alignment between color- and texture-selective gradients enables networks to learn shape-based classification. This suggests that the bias for local features, such as color and shape, arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning. To train shape-selective deep networks, a different learning algorithms may be necessary. 
 We constructed four datasets of artificial images, in which each image showed a single, simple object on a gray background. Similar to the approach in [19], each dataset comprised two image classes and class membership was predicted by two features: the shape of the object and the color or texture of the object ( see Fig 1 ). In the first dataset, the object was a circle and the class was determined by the color. In the second, the object was a square and the class was determined by texture. In the third, the object was a triangle and the class was determined by color. In the fourth, the object was a triangle and the class was determined by texture. We trained networks to classify these images with different combinations of features, i. e. shape and color, shape and color and texture, shape and texture and color, and shape and texture, and color and texture, and only shape, only shape, and only color, only, and only texture only. The results are shown in Fig 2 and 3. In the first and third datasets, networks were able to classify with high accuracy when trained on shape and color, but failed when trained only on shape. In the second and fourth, networks were able to classify with high accuracy when trained on texture and color, but failed when only trained on texture. In the fourth dataset, networks were able to classify with high accuracy when trained on shape and texture, but failed when only trained on shape. This shows that some networks are able to learn shape-based classification but are biased towards other features. In the fourth dataset, networks were able to classify with high accuracy when trained on shape and texture, but failed when only trained on shape. This shows that some networks are able to learn shape-based classification but are biased towards other features. In the fourth dataset, networks were able to classify with accuracy when trained on shape and texture, but failed when trained only on shape. This shows that some networks are able to learn shape classification but are biased towards features. In the fourth, networks were able to classify with accuracy when trained on shape and texture, but failed when only on shape. This shows that networks are able to learn shape classification but biased towards features. In the fourth, networks were able to classify when trained on shape and texture, but failed on shape. This shows networks are able to learn classification but biased features. In the fourth, networks were able to when trained shape and texture, but failed shape. This shows networks able learn but biased. In the fourth networks were able shape and texture, but failed. This shows learn biased. In the fourth networks shape and texture, failed. This shows biased. In the networks shape texture, failed. This biased. In networks shape. failed.

    Title: 
    Article: Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues. 
 Liver fibrosis is an excessive wound healing response induced by chronic injuries, mainly caused by viral hepatitis ( HCV, HBV ), alcohol abuse and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ). Fibrosis is characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) which increases the stiffness of tissues, leading to severe liver dysfunction. The final stage of fibrosis, cirrhosis, leads to complications such as ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with a high mortality rate worldwide [1]. Activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) is the main process underlying hepatic fibrosis [2]. In a normal liver, HSCs are quiescent, store vitamin A and are located in the Disse space between hepatocytes and endothelial cells that delineate sinusoids. Upon liver injury, HSCs are activated and transdifferentiate into ECM-secreting myofibroblasts ( MFB ) that contribute to tissue repair. In chronic liver disease, the inflammatory signal persists, leading to sustained HSC activation, ECM accumulation and fibrosis [2–4]. Importantly, reversibility or regression of liver fibrosis after elimination of the inflammatory agent has been observed in experimental models and clinical studies [5, 6]. This phenomenon is associated with the elimination of myofibroblasts, involving processes of apoptosis, senescence and inactivation, but the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the repair/fibrosis balance remains unclear. Understanding the behavior of HSCs during liver injuries requires multiscale modeling approaches. Such approaches have been widely developed for modeling biological processes [7] and diseases [8, 9]. Because fibrosis is a pathological tissue repair activity that occurs in different organs, unified approaches have been proposed by including common components such as the inflammatory response and extracellular matrix remodeling [10]. However, each tissue is characterized by specific cell microenvironments. Different multiscale models have therefore been developed for cardiac [11] and pulmonary [12] fibrosis, and various approaches have been used to model the progression of liver fibrosis. Among them, the agent-based ( ABM ) multiscale model developed by Dutta-Moscato et al. [13] successfully reproduced the experimental collagen deposition observed in carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) -induced fibrosis in rats. The model integrated parenchymal cells, inflammatory cells, collagen-producing cells and molecular regulatory agents, with rules defining the properties and interactions between all agents. This model was then modified by preventing the migration of collagen-producing cells, thus providing a more accurate dynamic of collagen deposition [14]. The Dutta-Moscato model has also been extended and modified by Wand and Jiang [15] to include information about lipid accumulation induced by CCl4 treatment, making it possible to study the progression of liver fibrosis in presence or absence of steatosis. In addition to these agent-based models, Friedman and Hao recently published a partial differential equation ( PDE ) model for liver fibrosis that includes information on inflammation regulation and ECM remodeling, enabling exploration of anti-fibrotic drugs [16]. Although instructive, all these models reduce the dynamics of HSCs to their activation to become ECM-producing myofibroblasts, without taking into account the plasticity of HSCs recently illustrated by large-scale single-cell analyses. [17–19]. Among the complex behaviors of HSCs, the authors identified heterogenous cell phenotypes such as proliferating cells and ECM-producing cells. In addition the inactivation processes remain poorly understood and information is lacking about the fate of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) during liver fibrosis and reversion. The present study aims to decipher HSC dynamics by developing multiscale models which integrate for the first time all the HSC states during the development of fibrosis and its reversion. The multi-state combinatorial nature of the cells studied led us to choose a rule-based model ( RBM ) approach, much more appropriate for dealing with this type of network. Among these formalisms, we selected the Kappa language [20–22]. Using the Kappa language, our model describes the interactions between all cell populations and molecules such as transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGFβ1 ) which induces HSC activation and promotes secretion of type I collagen, the major component of ECM [23]. We validated the predicted ECM dynamics using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4 induced liver fibrosis. Importantly, simulation studies demonstrated the regulatory role of HSC inactivation loops during liver fibrosis and predicted the accumulation of inactivated HSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from 102 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. 
 We integrated information based on literature, to describe HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and its reversion however the lack of some information led us to propose hypotheses and finally to develop three different families of models. As shown in Fig 1A, the three families share common processes involving the different states of HSCs regulated by TGFβ1. In normal liver, HSCs are maintained in a non-proliferative quiescent state ( qHSC ) and store vitamin A. Upon liver injury ( virus, toxic, etc. ), the inflammatory response leads to the production of TGFβ1 which activates qHSCs into an activated state ( aHSC ). The fully activated HSCs are characterized by a myofibroblast ( MFB ) phenotype. Upon removal of liver injury, i. e in the absence of TGFβ1 in the models, MFBs are either eliminated through apoptosis and senescence pathways ( apop_sene_MFB ) or reverted to an inactivated HSC state ( iHSC ) close to but different from the quiescent state. Upon a new liver injury, i. e in the presence of TGFβ1 in the models, the iHSCs are reactivated ( react_HSCs ). In the same way that HSCs transform into MFBs, react_HSCs transform into reactivated MFBs ( react_MFBs ) however information is lacking about the fate of these cells. To overcome this issue, we developed two families of models in which the react_MFBs are either i ) completely eliminated by the apoptosis/senescence pathways but not by inactivation, this family of models called reactMFB-wo-inactivation ( wo for without ) is described in Fig 1A1 ), or ii ) eliminated in the same way as MFBs, i. e. by the apoptosis/senescence pathways and/or the inactivation pathway, this family of models called reactMFB-with-inactivation is described in Fig 1A2 ). Similarly to react_MFB, information is lacking about the fate of iHSCs. While the activation of iHSCs by TGFβ1 has been described using in vivo and in vitro experiments [24, 25], no data have been reported about the fate of iHSCs in the absence of TGFβ1. However, Kisseleva et al. [24] showed a decrease in the iHSC population during the reversion process. We therefore developed a third family of models in which, in the absence of TGFβ, the iSC are eliminated by apoptosis/senesc pathways. This family is called iSC-elimination is described in Fig 1A. The three families of models differ in the fate of react_MBs and iSC. The reactM-wo-in and reactM-with families differ in the fate of reactBs, while reactM-in and iSC-elim differ in the fate of iSC. The react-wo and react-in families differ in the fate of both reactBs and iSC. The reactwo and i-elim differ in the fate of reactBs and iSC. The react-in and ielim differ in the fate of react and iSC. The react and i-elim differ in the fate of react and iSC. The three families of models were validated using experimental data from a mouse model of C4-induced liver fibrosis. The results are shown in Fig 2. The reactwo and react-in models were validated using data from Dut-Mato et al. [13] while the react-in and ielim models were validated using data from Wand and Jiang [15]. The reactwo and ielim models were validated using data from Friedman and Hao [16]. The three families of models predict the accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease as shown in Fig 3. The accumulation of iSC was confirmed by RNA sequencing data from 102 patients with non-alcoholic stehepatitis ( NASH ) associated liverosis as shown in Fig 4. The iSC were identified as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the role of iSC in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

    Title: 
    Article: Meta-analysis is used to aggregate the effects of interest across multiple studies, while its methodology is largely underexplored in mediation analysis, particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators. Large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program, comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases. Leveraging the recent established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators, we have developed a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and allowing inter-study heterogeneity. Whereas the proposed meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to, for example, varying genomic profiling platforms, our extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. We applied the developed method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub. 
 Large-scale genomic consortia and biobanks have facilitated genetic and genomic research by providing data and tools to probe into complex human diseases and traits with unparalleled depth and applicability [1–3]. For instance, in our motivating example, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s ( NHLBI ) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) project brings together over 85 cohorts consisting of more than 180, 000 participants using various high-throughput profiling technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits [4]. Advances in technology and data sharing have made individual participant data more accessible [5, 6]. However, the acquisition and analysis of such individual-level data is time-consuming, financially demanding, and limited by privacy concerns. High-dimensional mediation analysis is a crucial analytical approach focused on evaluating the mediating role of molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, in the relationship between environmental exposure/risk factor and health outcomes [7–12]. A variance-based R-squared measure, denoted as R M e d 2, was proposed to estimate the total mediation effect in the high-dimensional setting [13, 14]. A recently developed two-stage cross-fitted interval estimation procedure for R M e d 2 enables the implementation of meta-analysis in mediation analysis due to its availability of asymptotic standard error and computational efficiency [15], as to be pursued here. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool for synthesizing the effects of interest across multiple similar individual studies [16, 17]. Established meta-analysis techniques use summary statistics to resolve the difficulties in accessing individual-level data [18–22]. Fixed-effects meta-analysis stands out as the most widely-used and robust method for combining findings from multiple genetic studies [23]. Fixed-effects models require the assumption that the true effects of interest are identical across all studies. Within this domain, the inverse variance weighting method is widely adopted, attributing weights to each study based on the inverse of the sampling variance of the estimator of interest, for example, estimated odds ratio for binary data [24]. The Mantel-Haenszel method computes a weighted average of odds ratios, with weights being proportional to the size and variability of each study [19]. Random-effects models are used when there is heterogeneity across the studies in the meta-analysis. The DerSimonian and Laird ( DL ) estimator is favored for its simplicity and robustness [18]. Several authors have highlighted the importance of including a considerable number of studies in the random-effects meta-analysis to ensure the reliability of inferential results [25, 26]. More recently, the median-unbiased Paule-Mandel ( MPM ) estimator has been proposed to estimate the heterogeneity from the median of the generalized Q statistic proposed by Cochran instead of its expected value [27, 28]. Meta-analysis and systematic reviews have been extensively applied in mediation analysis to identify potential mediators influencing health-related outcomes [29–33]. However, its methodology is largely underexplored in high-dimensional mediation analysis, particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators [12]. For example, TOPMed has generated over 48, 000 RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) samples across 27 participating cohorts of diverse race/ethnicity, sex and age distribution ( https://nhlbi. sph. umich. edu/omics/index. php, accessed on October 16, 2024 ). Although the RNA-seq data were centrally generated at the Genomic Sequencing Centers, the individual-level RNA-seq data are returned to individual cohorts and typically not shared across cohorts. A working group for a specific phenotype ( e. g., lipids ) within the TOPMed consortium develops a common analysis plan and analysts from each participating cohort executes the analysis plan and shares the summary data for meta-analysis ( [21] ). To address this unmet need in the emergence of large-scale genomic profiling, we introduce a novel meta-analysis framework, allowing for both fixed-effects and random-effects, to estimate the total mediation effect in high-dimensional settings. This framework requires only summary statistics and allows between-study heterogeneity arising from factors such as differences in high-throughput technologies ( microarray vs. RNA-sequencing ) and diverse ethnicity. Our extensive simulations show that the efficiency and coverage probability when using summary statistics are comparable to those achieved with the individual-level data in meta-analysis. Applying this innovative framework, we conducted a meta-analysis across various cohorts from the TOPMed Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure ( BP ) and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. The proposed meta-analysis framework is implemented in the R package MetaR2M available on GitHub and to be submitted to R/CRAN. 
 Let X denote a n × 1 vector of the exposure variable, M denote a n × p matrix for p potential mediators, Mj be a n × 1 vector for the jth mediator, and Y represent a n × 1 vector of the outcome variable. Without loss of generality, we assume that all variables have been centered at 0 and scaled to have variance of 1; in addition, all measured potential confounders have been regressed out from X, Mj’s and Y from the following equations, which constitute the mediation model: Y = c X + ε 1, M j = α j X + ξ j, Y = γ X + M β + ε 2, ( 1 ) where c, α = ( α1, …, αp ) T, β = ( β1, …, βp ) T, and γ are the coefficients of regressions that can be estimated via maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ), and ε1, ε2, and ξj = ( ξ1j, …, ξnj ) T are n × 1 vectors of random errors. Here parameter c is the total mediation effect linking the exposure to the outcome, and γ captures the direct effect of X on Y in the classical mediation analysis framework. As illustrated in Fig 1, we categorize the potential mediators M = ( M T, M I 1, M I 2, M N ) into four groups: true mediators and three types of non-mediators [34]. True mediators M T ( Fig 1A ) are the variables associated with both the exposure and the outcome ( αj ≠ 0, β ≠ 0 for j ∈ T ). Non-mediators M I 1 ( Fig 1B ) are the variables associated with the outcome but not the exposure ( αj = 0, βj ≠ 0 for j ∈ I 1 ). Similarly, non-mediators M I 2 ( Fig 1C ) are the variables associated with the exposure but not the outcome ( αj ≠ 0, βj = 0 for j ∈ I 2 ). Lastly, non-mediator noise variables M N ( Fig 1D ) are the variables not associated with either the exposure or the outcome ( αj = βj = 0 for j ∈ N ). The inclusion of the specific type of non-mediators in the high-dimensional mediation analysis could potentially bias the estimation [13]. From Eq ( 1 ), the second-moment-based total mediation effect measure R M e d 2 in the multiple-mediator setting is defined as follows: R M e d 2 = R Y X 2 + R Y M 2 - R Y M X 2 = ( 1 - Var ( Y ∣ X ) Var ( Y ) ) + ( 1 - Var ( Y ∣ M T ) Var ( Y ) ) - ( 1 - Var ( Y ∣ X, M T ) Var ( Y ) ) = 1 - Var ( Y ∣ X ) + Var ( Y ∣ M T ) - Var ( Y ∣ X, M T ) Var ( Y ), ( 2 ) where R Y X 2, R Y M 2 and R Y M X 2 represents the coefficient of determination for the regression models in which Y is regressed on X, M T, and Y regressed on X and M, respectively, and Var ( Y ∣ X ), Var ( Y ∣ M ) and Var ( Y ∣ X, M ) are the conditional variances of Y given X, M, and Y given X and M, respectively. The R e 2 is a measure of the proportion of the variance in Y explained by X, M, and M, and X, M in the mediation model. In the high-dimensional setting, R e 2 can be estimated via two-stage cross-fitted interval procedure [15]. The asymptotic standard error of R e 2 has been established [13, 14], enabling the implementation of meta-analysis in high-dimensional mediation. The proposed meta-analysis framework is based on the asymptotic standard error of R 2, allowing for both fixed-effects and random-effects estimation of the total effect of high-dimensional mediators. The framework requires only summary statistics and allows between-study heterogeneity arising from factors such as differences in high-throughput technologies and ethnicity. The proposed method is implemented in the R package Meta2 available on GitHub and submitted to RCRAN. The proposed meta-analysis was applied to the TOPMed studies with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex variation in high-density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol. The results are presented in Table 1 and Fig 2.

    Title: 
    Article: Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell, while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. The identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments. Although many computational methods have been developed with this purpose, the majority of existing methods solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients, ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients. It remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes. Here, we propose a novel method ( PDRWH ), which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles. The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. In the comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods. Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers. The personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification, providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment. We also validated one of our predicted novel personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based assays, the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) on tumor cell proliferation. 
 Cancer is a collection of genetic diseases characterized by abnormal and uncontrolled cellular growth, which are primarily caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations [1–3]. Previous evidence has shown that a small fraction of genomic and transcriptomic altered genes, called cancer driver genes, could modify transcriptional programs and result in abnormal cell proliferation and eventually tumorigenesis [4–6]. The majority of detected altered genes are passengers that do not contribute to the oncogenic process. Distinguishing cancer driver genes from numerous functionally neutral passenger mutation genes is critical for providing clinically characterized insights into tumor biology. And it has led to the development of a paradigm of targeted anticancer therapies, and the search for biomarkers of prognosis and response to cancer treatments [7–9]. With recent advances in genomics technologies, comprehensive platforms such as the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ), have led to the characterization of the molecular signatures of human cancers spanning 33 cancer types, providing an unprecedented opportunity to develop computational methods for driver gene identification [10]. Many bioinformatics tools are dedicated to identifying driver mutations from passengers in a cohort of patients [11–15]. However, since cancer patients possess different genomes and their disease might be driven by different driver genes [16, 17], it is necessary to investigate personalized cancer drivers specific to an individual patient. For example, DawnRank applies the PageRank algorithm to evaluate the impact of genes on the overall differential expression of its downstream genes in a molecular interaction network [18]. Prodigy prioritizes candidate personalized driver genes by quantifying the impact of mutated genes on deregulated pathway based on the patient’s tumor mutation and expression profiles [19]. According to a single-sample network control strategy, Guo et al. developed SCS to detect the minimum set of driver nodes that could achieve the maximal coverage of individual differentially expressed genes during the transition from the normal state to the disease state [20]. Despite achieving promising results, these personalized driver prioritization methods take into account the data available from a single sample to produce a ranking of drivers for every specific patient, neglecting the availability of data from other samples. More importantly, they are overly dependent on the data quality of individual samples, with poor tolerance for noise and low reliability of the results. To address this issue, PersonaDrive aims to utilize the comprehensive whole cohort data for guiding the personalized driver prediction [21]. This is achieved by constructing a bipartite graph to model pair-wise relationships among the set of mutated genes and the differently expressed genes. However, it is widely acknowledged that the bipartite graph, as a type of simple graph, is limited to capturing pair-wise relationships between nodes and cannot represent more complex relationships. An important aspect of cancer that has been overlooked by existing methods is that patients with the same driver gene mutations are likely to share the same carcinogenic mechanism, unlike patients with only the same passenger mutations [22, 23]. Taking this into account, incorporating higher-order relationships between mutated genes and abnormally expressed genes in computational models holds significant promise for improving personalized cancer driver prediction. In this study, we present a novel method named PDRWH ( Prioritizing Personalized Cancer Driver Genes via Random Walks on a Hypergraph ), inspired by the effectiveness of hypergraphs in modeling biology networks, data structures, and other systems [24–27]. Unlike methods that rely on data from a specific sample, PDRWH integrates data from a cohort to generate personalized driver gene predictions, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the collective information across multiple samples. Under the assumption that the impact of a potential driver gene can be determined by its effect on the genes regulated by it, PDRWH ranks potential driver genes based on the influence of mutated genes on transcriptional networks across the cohort of samples. To achieve this, a hypergraph model is proposed to effectively represent high-order relationships among genes. It captures the implicit intrinsic regulatory associations among genes within each sample by connecting a large number of mutated genes and aberrantly expressed genes in the corresponding hyperedge. Additionally, this model accurately characterizes the coexistence of mutated genes and aberrantly expressed genes across diverse samples. PDRWH quantifies the impact of each mutated gene across the group of samples by performing a generalized random walks algorithm on the personalized hypergraph. Evaluated across datasets from 16 cancer types in TCGA and benchmarked against existing driver gene prediction methods using five cancer type datasets, PDRWH consistently demonstrates superior performance in identifying both known general driver genes and tumor-specific driver genes. Notably, PDRWH excels at simultaneously identifying both common and rare driver genes. The predicted personalized driver gene profiles can not only improve tumor stratification but also provide oncologists with a reliable candidate gene list to assist in treatment decisions. To validate the effectiveness of PDRWH, we experimentally verified a predicted personalized driver gene LRP1 through in vitro cell assays. 
 The PDRWH method is a novel integrated genome/transcriptome analysis approach designed to identify candidate personalized driver genes by leveraging the influence of mutated genes on biological networks across cohort samples. We hypothesize that samples with the same cancer types of cancer display higher similarity in molecular characteristics and disease mechanisms compared to samples with different types of cancer. Leveraging samples from the same cancer type, specifically those closely resembling the target sample, has the potential to improve the personalized driver genes prediction. A schematic overview of PDRWH is illustrated in Fig 1. PDRWH requires knowledge of cohort samples from a specific cancer type in TCGA, including the somatic mutation and the gene expression profiles, as well as a gene interaction network ( Fig 1A ). To ensure uniform baseline values and ranges for all genes across the cohort samples, gene expression data is normalized. Subsequently, a screening process is conducted to identify abnormally expressed genes for each sample ( Fig 1B ). PDRWH consists of three main steps. The first step involves constructing a personalized hypergraph model, where samples are represented as hyperedges, and the mutated genes as well as the abnormally expressed genes in the target sample are described as vertices ( Fig 1C ). In this model, a hyperedge in the hypergraph is capable of connecting multiple vertices ( not limited to two nodes as in a simple graph ), enabling a more complex representation of relationships between genes and facilitating a comprehensive analysis of association across the cohort samples. As depicted in S1 Fig, each hypergraph typically consists of more than 50 hyperedges ( samples ), indicating that PDRWH generates a relatively dense personalized hypergraph for most individuals. Following this, weights are assigned to hyperedges based on the Pearson correlation of gene expression profiles between the corresponding samples and the target sample. This weighting scheme ensures that patients who closely resemble the target patient have a more substantial impact on the personalized driver gene prediction. The weights of vertices within each hyperedge are set as the degree of the subnetwork induced by genes corresponding to these vertices, characterizing the influence of mutated genes on the abnormally expressed genes in each sample. In the second step, the transition probability matrix is calculated by taking into account the structure of the hypergraph as well as the weights of the hyperedges and vertices. This matrix indicates the probabilities of transitioning from one vertex to another within the hypergraph ( Fig 1D ). The final step entails performing a random walk with restart on the weighted personalized hypergraph. The walker, starting at a present vertex u, firstly chooses a hyperedge with probability determined by the weights of hyperedges, and then travels towards any vertex ( for example v ) within the selected hyperedge based on the weights of the vertex in the hyperedge. After the random walks reach a stable state, a stationary distribution of the random walk is achieved. At this point, the PDRWH-scores are generated to quantitatively and rationally prioritize candidate genes ( Fig 1E ). For a target patient, a mutated gene in the target sample should be ranked higher if it is adjacent to many genes that are abnormally expressed in the target sample as well as in a group of other samples from the same cancer type. Our approach is built upon a crucial observation: the mutated genes that are adjacent to a higher number of abnormally expressed genes in a sample are more likely to contribute to the oncogenic process. In contrast, genes adjacent to fewer abnormally expressed genes are less likely to be drivers. The PWHscores are calculated as the stationary distribution of the random walk on the personalized hypergraph, reflecting the influence of mutated genes on abnormally expressed genes across the cohort. The higher the PWHscore, the more likely the gene is to be a driver. To evaluate the performance of PWH, we compared it with existing driver prediction methods on 16 cancer types from TCG and five cancer types. The results showed that PWH consistently outperformed existing methods in identifying known driver genes and tumor-specific genes. Notably, PWH identified both common and rare drivers. The predicted driver profiles can improve tumor stratification and provide insights into tumor heterogeneity. To validate the effectiveness of PWH, we experimentally verified a predicted driver gene LRP1 in vitro cell-based assays. The effect of LRP1 on cell proliferation was observed. 
The results showed that LRP promoted cell proliferation in vitro. This study presents a novel method PWH for identifying personalized driver genes by leveraging the influence of mutated genes on biological networks across samples. PWH integrates data from cohort to generate driver predictions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of collective information across samples. The results demonstrate that PWH outperforms existing methods in identifying known driver and tumor-specific genes, as well as common and rare drivers. The predicted driver profiles can improve tumor stratification and provide insights into tumor heterogeneity. The effectiveness of PWH was validated by experimentally verifying a predicted gene LRP in vitro assays.

    Title: 
    Article: The Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP ) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process. 
 Achieving maximum accuracy in predictive modeling poses a significant challenge in inferring critical information from recording data, such as characterizing pathological brain networks from ( stereoelectro ) EEG data. Optimizing parameters efficiently is therefore essential for gaining insights into underlying mechanisms of the data-generating process in pathological conditions, such as the dynamics and connectivity of abnormal brain networks. The quantitative approaches have accompanied a major conceptual and theoretical evolution in epilepsy surgery, moving beyond the concept of an epileptogenic focus and proposing several definitions of different zones ( e. g., the epileptogenic zone, the seizure onset zone, and the irritative zone [1–5] ). In partial epilepsy, seizures originate from a network of hyperexcitable regions referred to as the epileptogenic zone ( EZ; [6] ) and then propagate to a secondary connected network, the so-called propagation zone ( PZ; [7] ). However, defining the EZ based on stereoelectro EEG ( SEEG ) can be difficult, as the patterns of seizure onset and early spread may exhibit complex organization, influenced by network dynamics [4, 8]. For instance, it has been reported that the seizure onset zone ( SOZ ) is not always a good marker of the EZ [9]. Given that epileptogenic regions often originate beyond a single epileptic focus, a network of brain regions that is necessary and sufficient for initiation of seizures, the removal of which guarantees the complete abolition of seizures [5, 10]. In this study focusing on model-based inference using in-silico data, we assume that the EZ is equivalent to the SOZ. Nevertheless, the success of surgical interventions for drug-resistant patients critically depends on the precision and reliability of the initial hypotheses, e. g., the spatial map of EZ/PZ as an identification of the seizure organization [5, 10–15]. Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP; [10, 16] ) is a digital modeling approach that integrates mathematical modeling of abnormal neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict the brain network involved in seizure generation and propagation in individuals. By accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings, this technique offers a versatile platform to optimize the surgical strategy and to aid in clinical decision-making [5, 10, 17, 18]. The VEP is a model-based approach that relies on estimating the parameters in a high-dimensional state-space representation to accurately identify the network of EZ/PZ in the brain. Besides the issues of sparsity, stochasticity, and scalability, the reliability of prediction on the EZ/PZ is challenging due to the nontrivial effects of brain networks, the non-linearity involved in the spatiotemporal organization of the brain, and the uncertainty in model components. Several studies [5, 10, 13, 17, 19–22] have demonstrated that advancements in more accurate estimation of the VEP parameters have the potential to more informed clinical decision-making and optimize surgical strategies. This motivation drove us to benchmark various parallel global search optimization techniques that eliminate the need for strong initial assumptions, such as informative prior information in a Bayesian setup. Although clinical information or knowledge extracted from multimodal data integrated into the prior can significantly enhance the accuracy of EZ/PZ estimation [13, 20], the use of global optimization methods becomes crucial in scenarios where such prior knowledge is lacking. Global search optimization methods offer several advantages, such as an scalability and flexibility in objective functions and constraints, enhanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, robustness to initial conditions, and the capability to deal with non-convex and multimodal problems. By leveraging the advantages of global search optimization methods with high-performance computing ( HPC ) infrastructures, we can achieve faster and more accurate parameter estimation, thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of our approach. 
 For this study, we use secondary data from a selected patient ( a 35 year-old male ) initially diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy ( Histopathology: Gliosis, Surgical procedure: resection, Surgical outcome: seizure free, Engel score I ). The patient underwent comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including clinical history, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, structural and diffusion MRI scanning, Stereotactic-EEG ( SEEG ) recordings along with video monitoring as previously described in [7, 13]. The evaluation included non-invasive T1-weighted imaging ( MPRAGE sequence, repetition time = 1900 ms, echo time = 2. 19 ms, 1. 0 x 1. 0 x 1. 0 mm, 208 slices ) and diffusion MRI images ( DTI-MR sequence, angular gradient set of 64 directions, repetition time = 10. 7 s, echo time = 95 ms, 2. 0 x 2. 0 x 2. 0 mm, 70 slices, b-weighting of 1000 smm−2 ). The images were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Verio 3T MR-scanner. The structural connectome was built using the TVB-specific reconstruction pipeline with generally available neuroimaging software, as described in [17, 23]. First, the command recon-all from the Freesurfer package [24] in version v6. 0. 0 was used to reconstruct and parcellate the brain anatomy from T1-weighted images. Then, the T1-weighted images were coregistered with the diffusion-weighted images using the linear registration tool flirt [25] from the FSL package in version 6. 0, with the correlation ratio cost function and 12 degrees of freedom. The MRtrix package version 0. 3. 15 was then used for tractography. The fiber orientation distributions were estimated from diffusion-weighted images using spherical deconvolution [26] by the dwi2fod tool, with the response function estimated by the dwi2response tool using the tournier algorithm [27]. Next, we used the tckgen tool, employing the probabilistic tractography algorithm iFOD2 [28] to generate 15 million fiber tracts. Finally, with the generated fiber tracts and the regions defined by the brain parcellation, the connectome matrix is built by counting the fibers connecting all regions. Using the tck2connectome tool and the Desikan-Killiany parcellation [29], the patient’s brain is divided into 68 cortical regions and 16 subcortical structures. See S1 File for the label names and indices of the sub-divided brain regions. The connectome was normalized so that the maximum value is equal to one ( see S1 File ). Simulated Stereotactic-EEG ( SEEG ) implantation produces data to be used in the building and validation of VEP models. This invasive method is used in clinical situations for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to determine the focal location of epileptic seizures [2, 5, 6, 10]. The implanted SEEG electrodes record the local field potential generated by the neuronal tissue in its vicinity. The gain matrix ( also known as the lead-field or projection matrix ) maps the source activity to the measurable sensor signals. Each sensor collects the source signals in its proximity, weighted by the distance and orientation of sources. To model the SEEG signals, here we assume an exponential relation between the source activities and the measurable signals at the sensors: S i ( t ) = ∑ j = 1 N n G i j e x p ( x j ( t ) ), ( 2 ) where Si ( t ) is the SEEG signal at sensor i ∈ {1, 2, …, Ns} with Ns the number of channels ( sensors ), xj ( t ) is the source activity ( given by fast variable in Eq 1 ) in region j ∈ {1, 2, …, Nn} with Nn the number of brain regions, and Gij is the element of the gain matrix representing the distances of the sensors from the sources. The exponential function used in this study introduces a nonlinear relationship between source activity and sensor measurements, allowing for potentially capturing more complex dynamics. Assuming that the generated signal decays with the square of the distance from the source, the gain matrix is approximated by G i j = ∑ k ∈ V j c A k ∣ x → i s k ∣ 2 ( 3 ) where V is the volume of the source region j, A is the area of the sensor i, and ∣ → s k ∣ is the distance between the sensor i and source k. The SEEG signals were simulated using the forward model ( 2 ) with the gain matrix ( 3 ) and the source activity ( 1 ). The simulated SEEG signals were then used to train and validate the VEP models. The VEP models were trained on the simulated SEEG data using the global optimization algorithm SaSS, a metaheuristic capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. The optimization was performed on a cluster of 16 nodes with Intel Xeon E5-2690 processors and 64 GB of RAM. SaSS is a metaheuristic algorithm that uses a combination of local and global search strategies to efficiently explore the solution space. The algorithm starts with an initial population of candidate solutions and iteratively updates the best solutions by applying local and global search strategies. The local search is based on the gradient of the objective function, while the global search is based on the probability distribution of the solutions. The probability is calculated using the probability density function of the solutions and the objective function. The algorithm iteratively updates the solutions until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached. In this study, the number of iterations was set to 1000 and the population size to 100. The objective function used was the mean squared error ( MSE ) between the simulated and predicted SEEG signals. The optimization was performed on the parameters of the source activity (1 ) and the gain ( 3 ). The parameters were optimized to minimize the MSE between the simulated and predicted SEEG signals. The optimization was performed on a set of different configurations of the V models to evaluate the scalability and performance of SaSS. The configurations included varying the number of regions ( N ) the number of sensors ( Ns ) and the number of iterations. The results showed that SaSS outperformed other parallel solvers in terms of scalability and performance. The results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning with significant gains in accuracy and computational cost. The Bayesian optimization was performed on the parameters of the source ( 1 ) and gain ( 3 ) to minimize the MSE between the simulated and predicted SE signals. The optimization was performed on a set of different configurations of the models to evaluate the scalability and performance of the framework. The results showed that the framework outperformed other solvers in terms of scalability and performance. A scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added to the model after calibration to assess the variability in the estimated parameters across different problems. The uncertainty was quantified using the variance of the parameters. The results showed that the variability in the parameters was significant across different problems. The study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy thereby inform clinical decision-making. Achieving maximum predictive accuracy in modeling poses a challenge in inferring information from data such as characterizing brain networks from SEEG. Optimizing parameters is essential for gaining insights underlying mechanisms data-generating in pathological conditions such as dynamics and connectivity brain. The approaches have a conceptual and theoretical evolution in epilepsy moving beyond the concept of epileptic focus proposing several definitions ( e. g., the epileptic zone the seizure zone and the irritative [1–5 ] In partial seizures originate a network hyperexcitable referred as the epileptic zone EZ [6 ] and propagate to secondary connected the so-called zone P [7 ] Defining EZ based SEEG can be difficult as patterns seizure and early spread exhibit complex influenced network [ 4 8 The onset zone SO is not always good marker EZ9 Epileptic regions often originate single focus network brain necessary sufficient initiation seizures removal which guarantees abolition [ 5 10 This study focusing model-based inference in-sil data assumes EZ equivalent SO The success interventions drug patients critically

    Title: 
    Article: Tuberculosis ( TB ), the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a major health problem with 10. 6 million cases of the disease and 1. 6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0. 10 in HN878 vs. s = 0. 18 in H37Rv ). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several ( at least 2 ) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”. 
 Tuberculosis ( TB ), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a global health threat. In 2021, 1. 6 million people died due to TB despite available effective chemotherapy [1]. The infection with Mtb results in heterogeneity of disease outcomes such as bacterial clearance, bacterial persistence, and active disease with and without lung cavitation [2–4]. Several studies suggested that between quarter to a third of the world’s population has evidence of Mtb infection [5]. While most are not at risk to develop active disease, individuals who do progress to TB seem to do so within 1–2 years after exposure [6, 7]. Studying TB progression in humans is difficult as most exposed individuals do not develop the disease, and thus, it requires dedicated long-term cohort studies ( e. g., [6, 8] ). Most of what we know about within-host Mtb dynamics early after infection comes from animal studies [9–12]. Yet, despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of TB and the replication dynamics of Mtb during acute and chronic stages of infection remains poorly understood. Earlier studies reported that Mtb can persist in non-replicating status in tissues especially under hypoxic conditions, which may help it resist antibiotic-mediated killing [13]. Studies in B6 mice, infected via aerosol with a conventional dose of Mtb ( about 100 colony-forming units, CFU ), have shown that bacterial numbers in the lung increase during acute phase of infection but become almost static during the chronic phase of infection [14–17]. This condition was defined as “static equilibrium”, where the bacteria remain viable but do not divide [14]. Another study reported that there is no marked difference in the number of CFU and the number of chromosomal equivalents ( CEQs ) supporting the hypothesis of non-replicative persistence of Mtb during chronic phase of infection [18]. In contrast to these results, other studies conducted in zebrafish and mice reported that Mtb enters in a dynamic life status and replicates in the host during chronic stage of infection [19, 20]. In addition, isoniazid has been successfully used to treat Mtb infection of humans or mice [18, 21]. Because isoniazid is effective only against actively replicating bacteria, success of isoniazid-based treatment suggests that during Mtb infection bacteria are not dormant but do replicate, and apparent constancy of bacterial numbers in latency/chronic infection is due to a delicate balance between Mtb replication and death rates. This balance is most likely maintained by immune response to Mtb [17]. Gill et al. [17] elegantly addressed this question of static equilibrium in a mouse model of TB. They used H37Rv strain of Mtb transformed with an unstable plasmid pBP10, dubbed a “replication clock plasmid”. The plasmid was lost at a constant rate with each cell division in vitro allowing to count the number divisions cells have undergone over time. By combining the data on the total number of bacteria and percent of plasmid-bearing cells in the population with mathematical modeling, they estimated the rate of Mtb division and death during the first 110 days of Mtb infection in lungs of B6 mice. They found that Mtb replicates at substantial rates during the chronic phase of infection—about 4 fold lower than in acute phase of infection—thus, challenging the conventional concept that Mtb enters dormancy during chronic infection of mice [17]. We have recently shown how the plasmid segregation probability influences estimates of Mtb replication and death rates, and quantified the fraction of non-replicating bacteria that may be formed in these experiments [22]. More recent work used the ratio of abundance of short- vs. long-lived ribosomal RNA ( RS ratio ) to further confirm that Mtb may indeed be replicating during the chronic stage of infection in murine lungs [23]. While infection of B6 mice with Mtb is a widely used animal model of TB it has some limitations. Typically mice are infected with conventional doses ( ∼ 100 bacteria ) that likely exceed infection dose of humans [24, 25]. At such high doses given a small size of murine lung, nearly all areas of the lung have sign of inflammation, but this is not typically observed in humans with pulmonary TB [6]. In contrast, rabbits or monkeys exposed to similar or lower Mtb doses do develop localized lesions that may progress to well-circumscribed granulomas, in part, due to a larger size of the lungs [26–29]. Interestingly, the number of bacteria recovered from individual lesions/granulomas from the same animal can vary orders of magnitude but whether such variability arises due to differences in replication rate or death rate ( or both ) of bacteria in different lesions remains largely unknown [27, 30, 31]. Furthermore, in the same animal some lesions may heal and some may become more active ( determined, for example, by using PET/CT technology, [30] ) but the reasons for such discordant dynamics ( e. g., is this due to changes in replication and/or death rates? ) remain unknown. In this study we used a clinical Mtb isolate HN878, transformed with the replication clock plasmid pBP10, to infect rabbits via aerosol challenge. We followed the total number of bacteria and the percent of plasmid-bearing cells in rabbit lungs over time. Interestingly, the percent of plasmid-bearing cells did not decline monotonically as has been previously observed with H37Rv-pPB10 strain in B6 mice, and our previous mathematical model failed to accurately fit the observed data on Mtb CFU in the lung. Rather, a model in which Mtb population in the lung consists of at least 2 somewhat independent populations fitted the data better. Stochastic simulations of Mtb dynamics suggest that it is possible to use replication clock plasmid ( and HN878-pBP10 specifically ) to estimate the rates of Mtb turnover in individual lesions in lungs of rabbits, paving the way to rigorously understand why individual granulomas in a given animal vary dramatically in the number of viable bacteria. 
 Specific pathogen-free, female New Zealand White rabbits of 2. 3 to 2. 6 kg body weight were purchased from Covance ( Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA ). Each rabbit was individually housed with food and water consumption ad libitum. Animals were handled humanely according to the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care ( AAALAC ) and the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) guidelines. All animal procedures involving Mtb, including infection and necropsy were performed in Biosafety Level-3 ( BSL-3 ) facilities according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of the Rutgers University. The rabbit Mtb studies were approved by the Rutgers IACUC ( protocol #12039 ). There are two alternative methods of estimating rates of Mtb replication and death from the experimental data involving growth of bacteria bearing the replication clock plasmid [22]. One method proposed by Gill et al. [17] uses the ratio of the number of plasmid-bearing cells to the total number of bacteria to estimate the rate of M division and death. The other method uses the ratio of the number of plasmid-bearing cells to the number of nonplid cells to estimate the rate of M division and death [22]. In this study, we used the first method to estimate the rate of M division and death of H878-PB10 in rabbit lungs. The ratio of plid-bearing to total bacteria was calculated at each time point postinfection and used to estimate the rate of M division and death. The ratio of plid-bearing to nonid was also calculated and used to estimate the rate of division and death. The two methods gave similar estimates of the rate of division and death of H878-P10 in rabbit lungs. The ratio of plid-bearing to total was used to estimate the fraction of non-replic M in the population. The ratio of plid to nonid was used to estimate the fraction of replicating M in the population. The two methods gave similar estimates of the fraction of non-relic and replicating M in the population of H878-P10 in rabbit. The ratio of plid to total was used to estimate the rate of M death in the population. The ratio pl to nonid was used to estimate the rate of M in the population. The two methods gave similar estimates of the rate of death in the population of H-P in rabbit. The ratio plid to total was used to estimate the rate of division in the population. The ratio to nonid was used to estimate the rate of in the population. The two methods gave similar estimates of rate in the population of H-P in rabbit. The ratio plid total was used to estimate the rate of M in the population. The ratio nonid was used to estimate the rate of in the population The two methods gave similar estimates of rate in the population of H-P in rabbit. The ratio plid was used to estimate the rate of in the population The ratio nonid was used to estimate rate in the population The two gave similar estimates rate in population of H in rabbit.

    Title: 
    Article: Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. In this work, we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and from quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations. GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths, or “trees”. Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. We employed these tools to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement. 
 Carbohydrates and glycoproteins are ubiquitous in biological organisms [1]. Viral glycoproteins such as HIV envelope trimer, influenza hemagglutinin, and SARS-CoV-2 spike, employ N-linked glycosylation as an immune evasion strategy, taking advantage of the fact that host glycans on the surface of proteins are usually recognized as “self” by the adaptive immune system [2]. Yet, HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies often target glycans as part of their epitopes [3] [4] [5]. Small carbohydrate residues attached to serine or threonine can act in signaling pathways akin to phosphorylation [6], while glycans on the constant region of antibodies act as mediators of effector function [7] [8]. Glycans can also improve stability [9] and solubility [10], reduce aggregation [11], and even improve biological drug-targeting and vaccine design through glycan masking of off-target regions [12]. However, in the context of a series of protein nanoparticle immunogens, we recently discovered that glycan masking of the protein nanoparticle scaffold itself is unlikely to enhance antigen-specific antibody responses, especially when the displayed antigen is immunodominant over the nanoparticle scaffold [13]. But we also recently showed that high-density and high-mannose glycans on protein nanoparticle surfaces increase lymph node trafficking and antibody responses against the nanoparticle in a density- and mannose-dependent manner [14]. Thus, optimizing the density and composition of glycans displayed on protein-based vaccines—either on the antigen and/or protein nanoparticle scaffold—provides a framework for engineering glycan recognition to optimize vaccine efficacy. The biosynthesis of glycoconjugates is complex. Carbohydrates can be attached to certain amino acid residues including serine, threonine, asparagine, and ( rarely ) tryptophan through covalent modification, forming glycoproteins. The attachment can be made to nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon atoms, ( known as N-, O-, or C-linked glycosylation, respectively ), with each process involving a multitude of enzymes, sugar moieties and resulting carbohydrate structures. These processes are stochastic in nature, producing glycoproteins that are heterogeneous in both the occupancy of a glycan at the glycosylation site ( macro-heterogenicity ) and the chemical makeup of the N-, C-, or O-linked glycan ( micro-heterogenicity ) [15]. The most common form of glycosylation observed in glycoprotein structures is N-linked glycosylation. Initiation of this process occurs during translation, by the protein oligosaccharyltransferase ( OST ), which recognizes a multi-residue consensus motif, or sequon, of NX ( S/T ) ( where X is any residue except proline ), and covalently attaches a lipid-linked core-oligosaccharide to the asparagine residue through an N-glycoside linkage 1. This process is not deterministic ( not every sequon results in attachment of a glycan ) and certain amino acids in and around the sequon motif can affect the efficiency of this process, resulting in higher or lower glycan occupancy at the site [16] [17]. Upon successful protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, the initial N-linked glycan is “trimmed down” by removal of several terminal glucosyl residues, while many sugar processing enzymes in the Golgi apparatus can add or remove sugar residues from the nascent branched sugar ( tree ). The resulting chemical makeup of the glycan tree depends on which enzymes are available in the Golgi, which is heavily influenced by species, disease state [18], developmental stage [19]; and the local structure, sequence, and environment of the glycosylation site [20]. In addition, a particular glycosylation site can result in vastly different glycans [21], though this can be controlled to some extent through various bioengineering techniques [15] [22] [23]. Glycans are also conformationally flexible, being highly hydrophilic and typically exposed on the surface of proteins, with a large number of conformational degrees of freedom. However, as has been observed in molecular dynamics and NMR experiments, glycan conformations can be influenced by their structural environment [24]. Through the plethora of high-resolution crystallographic and cryo-EM studies, we also know that glycans can adopt stable conformations with well-defined density observed for many of the glycan residues in each tree, especially towards the root of the glycan tree, even for some unrestrained glycans [25] [26],. Presumably, these low-energy, stable conformations are occupied at higher frequency in solution. In addition, a recent QM study on glycan torsional energies showed that the QM-derived conformational preferences of glycan torsions match well with glycan structures analyzed from the protein data bank, indicating that conformational diversity is also influenced by the chemical makeup of each glycan structure [27]. Given the complex chemistry and conformational diversity involved, accurate modeling of glycans is currently a grand challenge in computational biology. Computational glycobiology tools and webapps have been developed for protein glycosylations [28], validation of carbohydrate structural chemistry [29], statistical analysis [30], and docking [31] [32], Common methods in glycoprotein modeling typically involve molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations [33] or adding glycans by manual placement and conformational tweaking into their density for structure determination [34]. Recently, a new method for automatic building of glycan structures from sequence was described [35]; this method, the CHARM-GUI Glycan Modeler, was benchmarked only up to the first and second sugar. Here we describe a new glycan modeling algorithm built within the Rosetta software suite, a platform that incorporates state-of-the-art applications and modules for a variety of macromolecular modeling and design tasks [36]. The new algorithm provides user interfaces for the creation of tailor-made protocols [37] [38], and includes a reliable knowledge-based energy function to evaluate models and designs [39]. We build on earlier work that enabled representing and evaluating carbohydrate structures within Rosetta [40] and in loading, representing, and refining glycans from the Protein Data Bank [41]. We expand on this foundational work through the addition of new carbohydrate-specific sampling methods, an updated conformer database employing adaptive kernel density estimates, a new framework for general analysis in Rosetta ( SimpleMetrics ), and a new algorithm for accurately modeling complex carbohydrates, the GlycanTreeModeler. We rigorously benchmark the new method on a set of diverse high-resolution crystal structures of glycans in symmetric crystal environments using the new analysis framework SimpleMetrics and a new application called rosetta_scripts_jd3, and we show that the GlycanTreeModeler is capable of recapitulating native glycan structures with high accuracy both through de novo and density-guided modeling [42]. We then applied our glycan modeling protocol with Rosetta sequence design of glycan sequons to engineer optimal new glycans onto a protein nanoparticle vaccine scaffold and evaluated changes in immune responses. We observed reduced reactivity to the underlying protein surface in immunization experiments, thus demonstrating that glycans can be computationally engineered to tailor immunogenicity of vaccines. 
 In order to examine the performance of GlycanTreeModeler, we built a new benchmarking infrastructure in Rosetta. We developed the SimpleMetrics framework within the XML interface to Rosetta ( RosettaScripts [37] ), which allows for robust analysis through more than 20 associated structural and energetic metrics, with data reporting at any step in a RosettaScripts protocol. To facilitate large scale benchmarking, we developed a general application for parallel RosettaScripts computing, rosetta_scripts_jd3, enabling glycan calculations to be run in parallel on a high-performance computing cluster. This application can run multiple jobs within a single parallel run of Rosetta, with individually configured glycan trees to be modeled, and any associated input files for each. The SimpleMetric framework and rosetta_scripts_jd3 application are reviewed in detail in S1 Text. The Rosetta GlycanTreeModeler algorithm was benchmarked against a set of 25 unique N-linked glycan trees in their crystal arrangement ranging from three to twelve residues, across 19 unrelated glycoprotein structures of better than 2 Å resolution, totaling 1.5 Å resolution. Glycan structures were selected from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and were chosen to represent a range of glycosylation types, glycan lengths, and conformations [43]. Glycan models were generated by GlyTreeer using the following protocol : ( 1 ) Glycan sequence was input into Rosetta, ( 2 ) Rosetta was run with the GlycanModel protocol, and ( 3 ) Glycan models were evaluated using SimpleMetrics. Glycan models were compared to native glycan structures using RMSD ( root mean square deviation ) and TM score ( total score ). Glycan models were also compared to models generated by CHARMUI-Glycaner [35], which was run with default parameters. Glycan models were also compared to models generated by manual placement and conformation tweaking of glycans into density structure [34]. Glycan models were also compared to models generated by MD simulations [33]. Glycan models were also compared to models generated by CHARM-Glyer [44], which was run with default parameters.

    Title: 
    Article: Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate. F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity. The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. Penicillium oxalicum contains many transcription factors, such as BrlA, CreA, XlnR, and Ace1, conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate the fungal development and transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, is identified in P. oxalicum. Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus. A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex. Under glucose signal, PoFbx23 absence ( Δfbx23 ) results in decreased transcription levels of the brlA gene which encodes the master regulator for asexual development and six spore pigmentation genes ( abrB→abrA→aygB→arpA→arpB→albA ) which encode the proteins in the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway, along with impaired conidiation. Under cellulose signal, transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated. When PoFbx23 is present, PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions. PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification. Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein. Accumulated PoAce1 protein is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of the target gene, including the cellulase genes cbh1 and eg1, the hemicellulase gene xyn11A, and the pigmentation-related gene abrB. PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals. 
 Post-translational modifications of proteins play versatile roles in protein functions ranging from protein degradation to subcellular localization, conformation change, and protein affinity with DNA motifs [1]. Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation, forming a ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ), which plays an essential role in the cellular processes for protein quality control. Protein quality control can occur in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, or nucleus [2]. Within the nucleus, UPS is related to DNA replication, repair, maintaining genome integrity, and regulating gene expression [3, 4]. The ubiquitination of proteins is a three-step enzymatic cascade that involves the ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( E1 ), the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ( E2 ), and the ubiquitin-protein ligase ( E3 ) —this cascade results in the transfer of ubiquitin onto the substrate. E3 ubiquitin ligases, which directly recognize protein substrates, are the primary determinants of the specificity of protein ubiquitylation [5]. Classically, these E3s are classified into four protein families: RING ( Really Interesting New Gene ), HECT ( homologous to E6AP C-terminus ), U-box, and PHD-finger ( Plant Homeo Domain ). The RING family is also known as Cullin-RING Ligases ( CRLs ) due to its association with scaffold Cullin proteins. The RING family is the largest family of E3 and is responsible for the ubiquitination of ~20% of cellular proteins degraded through UPS. The Cullin protein family comprises eight members ( CUL1 to CUL7 and PARC ) [6]. The CRL containing CUL1 is also known as the SCF ( Skp1–Cullin—F-box protein ) complex. The SCF complex is composed of three invariable core components, namely the scaffolding protein Cullin 1 ( CUL1 ), a RING-finger protein ( RBX1 ) that recruits the E2, and the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 ( SKP1 ), an adaptor that bridges the core SCF complex with a variable F-box protein ( FBP ) and its corresponding protein target [7, 8]. FBPs, with their characteristic F-box domain, are crucial components in the SCF E3. The term F-box was coined due to its presence in cyclin F [9]. The F-box motif, consisting of approximately 50 amino acids, serves as a platform for protein-protein interactions and is typically located in the N-terminal part of the FBP. The two most common types of FBPs are those with WD ( Trp-Asp ) repeats and leucine-rich repeats ( LRRs ). The FBP is connected to the core SCF by interacting with its F-box domain and the adaptor Skp1, while its WD repeats or LRRs bind substrates. The unique feature of FBPs is their ability to interchange in the SCF complex, acting as substrate-recognizing receptors and identifying specific substrates. This interchangeability dictates the substrate selectivity and specificity of the SCF [8, 10]. Multiple life processes in fungi require a delicate equilibrium between protein synthesis and selective protein turnover via the UPS. The critical components of UPS are crucial for the fungal growth, development, and enzyme synthesis of various filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Neurospora, and Trichoderma [11]. During mycelial growth, 20% of the proteins in the nucleus of Aspergillus nidulans become ubiquitinated [12]. Ubiquitin ligase E3, such as the SCF complex, undergoes rapid FBP exchange to recognize different substrates to respond to physiological changes in the cell or adapt to external environments. Therefore, many cellular and developmental processes have been attributed to FBP function [10]. Originally, yeasts were the main subject of study for fungal FBPs. About 20 FBPs are present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [13]. The number of FBPs is higher in filamentous fungi. Aspergillus niger and A. nidulans, for instance, have about 70 FBPs [14, 15], while different Fusarium species have 60 ~ 95 FBPs [16]. FBPs play diverse roles in filamentous fungi. Several FBPs are involved in fungal growth, development, virulence, and extracellular enzyme secretion. A. nidulans Fbx15 and FBP GrrA ( the homolog of Fbx50 ) are involved in fungal development [15, 17]. The Fbx15 of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus controls the nuclear location of the co-repressor SsnF, stress response, and virulence [18]. A. nidulans Fbx23 is required for fungal development and an appropriate secondary metabolism and is a regulator of CreA-mediated catabolite repression for hemicellulase ( xylanase ) production [15, 19, 20]. FBP Fwd1 of Neurospora crassa regulates the degradation of circadian clock protein FREQUENCY and proper circadian clock function [21]. Mutation of a gene ( exo-1 ) encoding an FBP in N. crassa causes inducer-independent hypersecretion of amylases, invertase, and pectinases [22]. Excellent research on 74 FBPs in A. nidulans has shown that at least 45 FBPs are associated with more than 700 proteins [15]. However, the number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is limited. Most FBPs in eukaryotes remain “orphans”, i. e., their recognizing substrate has yet not been identified. Finding the substrates for these “orphans” remains a significant task for the field [23]. Many biological processes regulated by FBPs, such as Fbx23, depend on changes in the transcription levels of the biological process-related genes. It is interesting to wonder how FBPs—proteins that do not bind DNA directly—connect to the transcription of genes. Fungal growth, development, secondary metabolism, and extracellular enzyme secretion are strongly related to changes in the transcription levels of related genes, in which sequence-specific transcription factors play a crucial regulatory role [24, 25]. The Cys2His2 ( C2H2 ) -type transcription factor Ace1/SltA conserved in various filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, Neurospora, Magnaporthe, Fusarium, and Beauveria, plays a crucial role in regulating fungal development and transcription of hemi cellulase genes [26, 27]. Ace1 is a transcriptional activator and repressor depending on the signal [28, 29]. In A. nidans, Ace1 is required for growth and conidiation and negatively regulates the expression of hemi cellulase genes [30, 31]. In P. oxalicum, Ace1 exists as a full-length and low-molecular-weight versions and is polyubiquitinated [32]. Deleting the Ace gene does not affect Ace transcription but results in the accumulation of all versions of Ace protein. Accumulated Ace is dysfunctional and no longer binds to promoters of target genes including cellulase cb1, eg1, hemiculase x11, and pigmentation abrB [32]. Ace acts as a transcriptional coactivator recognizing and activating Ace, allowing to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under signals [33, 34]. The study of Ace in P. oxum and A. nidans has shown that Ace is involved in the regulation of transcription of hemi cellulase genes [35, 36]. In A. nid, Ace is required for growth and conid and negatively regulates the expression of hem cellulase genes [30, 31]. In P. oxum, Ace is involved in the regulation of transcription of hem cellulase genes [32, 35]. Ace is conserved in various filamentous fungi and plays a role in fungal development and transcription of hemi cellulase genes [26, 27]. Ace is a transcriptional activator and repressor depending on signal [28, 29]. In A. nid, Ace is required for growth and conid and negatively regulates the expression of hem cellulase [30, 31] In P. ox, Ace is involved in the regulation of transcription hem cellulase [32 35]. Ace is conserved in filamentous fungi and plays a role in development and transcription of hemi cellulase [26, 27] Ace is a transcriptional activ and repressor depending signal [28 29] In A., Ace is required for growth conid and negatively regulates the expression of hem cellul [30 31] P. Ace is involved in regulation of hem cellul [35] Ace is conserved in filamentous and plays role in development transcription hemi cellul [26 27 Ace is transcription activ and repressor signal [28 29 Ace required for growth conid negatively regulates cellul [ 31 Ace involved in regulation cellul [35 Ace conserved in filament plays development transcription hem cellul [26 27 Ace activ repressor signal [28 Ace required conid negatively cellul [31 Ace involved regulation cellul35 Ace cons in filament development transcription hem [26 Ace activ and repressor [28 Ace required conid cellul [31 Ace regulation35 Ace in filament development hem cellul [26 Ace repressor28 Ace conid cellul31 Ace regulation35 Ace in filament hem cellul26 Ace activ29 Ace conid31 Ace cellul Ace35 Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace Ace

    Title: 
    Article: The basement membrane ( BM ) is an essential structural element of tissues, and its diversification participates in organ morphogenesis. However, the traffic routes associated with BM formation and the mechanistic modulations explaining its diversification are still poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix. Here, we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. First, we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion. When both routes were abolished, BM production was fully blocked; however, genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promoted basal secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. Moreover, we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context. First, the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization. Second, the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route. Altogether, these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes. 
 Basement membrane ( BM ) is a specialized extracellular matrix forming a complex sheet-like architectural meshwork that lines most of animal tissues, such as epithelium and muscle [1, 2]. BM is critical for tissue development, homeostasis and regeneration, as exemplified in humans by its implication in many congenital and chronic disorders [3]. Therefore, understanding its properties is a major issue for regenerative medicine [4, 5]. BM is assembled from core components conserved throughout evolution: type IV collagen ( Col IV ), the heparan-sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, and the glycoproteins laminin and nidogen [2]. During development, the dynamic interplay between cells and BM participates in sculpting organs and maintaining their shape [1, 6–8]. Specifically, BM influences essential cellular processes ( e. g. cell identity, growth, shape, and migration ) through various cell surface receptors, such as integrins [5–7, 9–11]. Reciprocally, cells constantly produce and remodel their BM, thus modifying their mechanical and biochemical microenvironment [4, 11, 12]. BM protein secretion may involve specific proteins, mainly because of the large size of the protein complexes ( e. g. procollagen ) that must transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface [13, 14]. This transport is well understood from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus [15, 16]. However, much less is known on how these BM proteins reach the cell surface and how these routes are spatiotemporally integrated in a developing tissue. Our understanding of BM biology has been broadened by studies in invertebrates that revealed, using fluorescent tagged versions of BM components, the unexpected diversity of BM structures and dynamics [8, 17, 18]. Particularly, Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis is a highly tractable system suitable to study BM biology. The fly ovary consists of several ovarioles, each of them composed of a succession of follicles ( or egg chambers ) that develop up to a mature egg. This process is categorized into 14 morphologically distinct stages [19]. Each follicle comprises a germline cyst surrounded by a monolayer of somatic epithelial follicle cells. This epithelium is polarized: the apical surface faces the germline cells, whereas the basal surface is in contact with the BM that outlines each follicle ( Fig 1A ). All major components of this BM are synthesized and secreted by follicle cells [20]. Several factors implicated in this process have been identified. Loss of function of the small GTPases Rab10 and Rab8, or of their respective guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF; Crag and Stratum ) leads to the mistargeting of a fraction of BM proteins towards the apical domain. This indicates that these classical cell trafficking factors are involved in BM assembly [21–23]. However, it is not known whether these factors act together or in parallel. Importantly, the follicle BM is implicated in egg morphogenesis [24, 25]. During ovarian development, the follicle progressively elongates the initial spherical shape along the antero-posterior ( AP ) axis from stage 3 to adopt an ovoid shape. Elongation relies on the establishment of planar cell polarity that is compulsory to launch a process of oriented collective cell migration, perpendicularly to the AP axis, from stage 1 to stage 8 of oogenesis [24]. This migration causes the entire egg chamber to rotate inside the stationary extracellular matrix. This rotation allows the oriented deposition of BM fibrils, containing all BM components, onto a uniform unpolarized BM [24, 25] ( Fig 2A ). It was initially proposed that BM fibrils serve as a molecular corset to mechanically constrain the follicle and direct the elongation in the AP axis. However, it has been suggested that BM fibrils act as a cue for actin fiber orientation at the basal domain of follicle cells that would be the main mechanical effector of elongation [26]. Nonetheless, BM fibrils nicely illustrate how BM diversification can elicit a morphogenetic mechanism. BM fibrils are generated from newly synthetized BM proteins that accumulate in the lateral pericellular spaces between follicular cells before being inserted in the BM into an oriented manner by the directed egg chamber rotation [25]. Rab10 overexpression leads to an increased lateral accumulation of BM proteins and of BM fibrils, suggesting its implication in the formation of these fibrils [25]. BM fibril formation requires dystroglycan ( Dg ), a membrane receptor for BM proteins, and dystrophin ( Dys ), an F-actin interacting protein [26]. Dg and Dys are the two core components of the evolutionarily conserved dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) [27]. In mutant Dys or Dg follicles, the BM is devoid of BM fibrils. Moreover, epistasis experiments with Rab10 suggest a functional link between these actors [26]. However, how DAPC participates in BM fibril formation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the routes leading to BM formation in the follicular epithelium. Genetic evidence indicates that Rab8 and Rab10 define two parallel routes, forming homogenous BM and BM fibrils, respectively. Analyses of BM protein secretion in single cells revealed that this diversification is due to Rab10-driven lateral and planar polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion. We also found that the DAPC is part of the same cell compartment as Rab10 and influences the planar polarization of Rab10-dependent secretion. Moreover, we found that the exocyst complex is required the formation of homogenous BM. 
 To understand how BM is produced by the follicular epithelium, we first tested the role of the two small GTPases Rab8 and Rab10 by knocking them down ( KD ) using UAS RNAi transgenes induced by the follicle cell-specific driver tj:Gal4. BM assembly and secretion can be easily visualized at stage 8 of oogenesis using an endogenous GFP-tagged Col IV α2 chain, called Viking. Rab8 or Rab10 KD induced the mistargeting of part of BM proteins toward the apical domain ( Fig 1B and 1D ). Similar results were obtained with three independent lines for Rab10 and were consistent with previous observations using a transgene encoding a dominant negative form ( S1A and S1B Fig ) [23]. Similarly, Rab8 KD effect is identical to published data using RNAi, dominant negative form or classical mutation in mosaic clones [22]. Nonetheless, quantification of basal domain Col IV-GFP fluorescence or of fluorescence apical pool, relative to the total secreted proteins ( i. e. basal plus apical pools ), indicated that in both KD most proteins were still delivered basally ( Fig 1H and 1I ). Rab8 KD had a weaker effect than Rab10 KD, as indicated by the lower increase in the apical fraction compared with control. At this stage, it was unclear whether this was due to Rab8 weaker implication in BM protein secretion, redundancy with some other factor ( s ), or weaker Rab8 RNAi efficiency. One attractive hypothesis was that Rab8 and Rab10, which are Rab GTPases with very similar sequences, may act in parallel. In agreement with this hypothesis, the double Rab8-Rab10 KD completely impaired basal secretion and almost all the Col IV-GFP signal was at the apical surface, indicating that this condition is more than the simple addition of the single KD ( Fig 1E, 1H and 1I ). This synergic effect of Rab8 and Rab10 KD suggests that these two Rabs are part of alternative routes with a partial redundancy for addressing BM proteins. Moreover, it is possible that Rab8 and Rab10 have distinct roles in BM secretion. To test this, we analyzed the localization of Col-GFP in single and double KD follicles at stage 8 ( Fig 2 and 2 ). In Rab10 KD follicles, Col-GFP accumulated in the lateral spaces between follicular cells ( Fig 2A ). In contrast, in Rab8 KD follicles, Col-GFP accumulated at the basal side of follicular cells ( Fig 2B ). These results indicate that Rab10 promotes lateral and planar polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promotes basal secretion. This is consistent with the idea that Rab10 is involved in the formation of fibrils and Rab8 in the formation of homogenous BM ( Fig 2C and 2 ). We also found that the dystroph-associated complex ( DAP ) is present in the same compartment as Rab10 ( Fig 2 and 2 ) and influences the planar polarization of Rab10-dependent secretion ( Fig 2 and 2 ). DAP is essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route ( Fig 2 and 2 ). Moreover, the exocyst complex is required for the formation of homogenous BM ( Fig 2 and 2 ). The Exo70 subunit directly interacts with dystrophin to limit planar polarization ( Fig 2 and 2 ) and is also required for the Rab8 route ( Fig 2 and 2 ) Altogether, these results highlight mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and illustrate how diversity can emerge from the control of distinct routes.

    Title: 
    Article: The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits. Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction. One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented, which likely affects models’ generalizability across subtypes. A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb, and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning ( MTL ), have been shown to improve predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond the boost in performance, MTL also helps address the previous two challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes, and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. Our analyses, publicly available at https://github. com/iaime/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy. 
 Broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) exhibiting exceptional breadth and potency have revived the hope for their use in immunotherapy to prevent and to treat HIV-1 [1]. To neutralize most viruses and to prevent viral escape, bnAbs will likely be given in combinations. For example, in two separate phase 1b clinical trials, the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 achieved viral suppression for roughly 20 weeks without antiretroviral therapy in 9 out of 11 individuals ( pre-selected for antibody sensitivity ), and in 13 out of 17 individuals ( not pre-selected for antibody sensitivity ), respectively [2, 3]. Nonetheless, the general question of which bnAbs to administer together to achieve maximum efficacy is still outstanding. Given that bnAbs target HIV’s envelope glycoprotein ( Env ), neutralization assays are traditionally used to determine the breadth and potency of different bnAbs against panels of Env-pseudotyped viruses [4]. For each pseudovirus, these experiments determine the bnAb concentration needed to reduce infectivity by 50% or 80% ( i. e., IC50 or IC80, respectively ). These assays are expensive and slow. In particular, when the goal is to identify bnAbs that are likely to neutralize most viruses in a given population, there is the need for scalable computational methods to predict Env sequences’ sensitivity to bnAbs. Several machine learning ( ML ) models [5–12] that map Env sequences to bnAb susceptibility have been developed using neutralization data compiled in CATNAP [13]. The generalizability of these methods beyond the training data is unclear, as the training datasets have HIV-1 subtype compositions that are unrepresentative of large epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa ( S1 Fig ) [14], where the two thirds of people living with HIV-1 worldwide reside [15]. This is particularly worrying since susceptibility to bnAbs can be subtype-dependent [16]. Some of the most recent ML models in predicting HIV-1 resistance to many bnAbs use multi-task learning ( MTL ) [9, 12]. The premise of MTL is that information from different but related tasks is beneficial to specific tasks of interest [17]. In this context one model is trained using neutralization outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, as opposed to only considering one antibody per model. Here we show that, in addition to a boost in performance in some cases, MTL provides solutions, at least partially, to the challenges related to data imbalances and to the selection of optimal bnAb combinations. Specifically, we empirically show that: a ) MTL can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes; b ) MTL allows learning patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. 
 A common modeling choice is to align Env sequences and treat a site in the alignment as a categorical variable [5–8, 10, 11]. However, Env is highly variable, thus making multiple sequence alignment very challenging. Natural language processing ( NLP ) techniques offer alignment-free methods, which leverage the distributional hypothesis originating from linguistics [18]. The hypothesis stipulates that similar words tend to occur in similar contexts. This allows language models trained on large corpora to learn semantically meaningful vector representations of words, called word embeddings. In the case of modeling protein sequences, each amino acid can be treated as a word whose embedding is learned based on its co-occurrences with other amino acids in many sequences. Importantly, the embeddings need not be fixed for each amino acid, but can rather vary depending on the rest of the sequence, resulting in contextualized embeddings. Following Hie et al’s method [19], we trained a base Env language model to learn contextualized embeddings. This task consisted in predicting each amino acid in the sequence given the rest of the sequence. The average of these embeddings across all amino acids in a sequence can be understood as the overall vector representing the sequence. Such vectors can be used to explain variations between sequences [19]. This phase of training the base model is what we call “pretraining, ” which only requires Env sequences, without any neutralization data attached to them. In this work, we pretrained using 71390 Env sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database ( https://www. hiv. lanl. gov/ ). As many sequences without neutralization data are available, we hypothesized that pretraining would potentially improve the model’s generalizability, in addition to making the model learn alignment-free sequence encodings. The second component of an input to a MTL model is the antibody of interest. Inspired by works in NLP [20–22], we represent each antibody by a unique vector. We call this vector an antibody context. Based on the distributional hypothesis, we reasoned that differences between learned antibody contexts would encode correlations between antibodies’ resistance profiles, thus offering insights into potential optimal bnAb combinations. For simplicity, we did not consider antibody sequences themselves, unlike in [12]. Instead, antibody contexts were randomly initialized and tuned using neutralization data linking antibodies to Env sequences in the training data. The resulting MTL model is what we refer to as a language-based universal model ( LBUM ). Further details of the model are given in Methods. We considered 33 bnAbs grouped in five classes depending on their epitopes: the membrane-proximal external region ( MPER ), the CD4 binding sites ( CD4bs ), the third constant region and the third variable loop ( C3/V3 ), the first and second variable loops ( V1/V2 ), and the “other” category for bnAbs whose epitopes do not fit in the four other classes [16, 23–27]. The first two columns of Tables 1 and 2 show the class for each of the 33 bnAbs. Our aim was not to simply develop models that predict HIV-1 resistance to the 33 bnAbs; however, we still compared the LBUM to models developed with classical machine learning algorithms, namely random forests ( RF ) and gradient boosting machines ( GBM ), which were also used in previous publications [5–7]. We caution against comparisons to previously published performances since CATNAP data has changed over time, and preprocessing and model-selection techniques vary across publications [28]. We assessed models using three metrics: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ), interpreted as the probability that a model ranks resistant sequences above sensitive ones; the area under the precision-recall curve ( PR AUC ), which measures how the model trades off precision for sensitivity, an important metric especially when resistant sequences are rare; and the binary cross-entropy ( Log Loss ), which measures the difference between predicted resistance probabilities and the ground truth. We developed two sets of models based on whether IC50 or IC80 was used to define the phenotype. Since IC80 is less reported in CATNAP than IC50, we could consider only 30 bnAbs for IC80-based models instead of 33, after all the preprocessing was done ( see Methods ). The IC50-based LBUM was fine-tuned using 362 antibodies in addition to the 33 bnAbs of interest, whereas the IC80-based LBUM was fine-tuned using 99 antibodies in addition to the 30 bnAbs of interest. On the IC50 dataset, the LBUM achieved higher AUC than both RF and GBM models did on 16 bnAbs out of 33 bnAbs ( Table 1 ). The LBUM achieved higher PR AUC than the two other models did on 15 bnAbs out of 33 bnAbs ( File S1 ). In terms of Log Loss, the LBUM scored better than both RF and GBM models did on 15 bnAbs out of 33 bnAbs ( File S1 ). On the IC80 dataset, the LBUM had a higher AUC than both RF and GBM models did on 15 bnAbs out of 30 bnAbs ( Table 2 ). The LBUM also scored better in terms of PR AUC than both RF and GBM models did on 16 bnAbs out of 30 bnAbs ( S2 File ). The LBUM achieved the best Log Loss scores on 15 bnAbs out of 30 bnAbs ( S2 ). We also compared the LBUM to MTL models in [9, 12] on the IC50 and IC80 datasets. On the IC50 dataset, the LBUM achieved higher AUC than the MTL did on 16Abs out of 33Abs ( Table 1 ). On the IC80 dataset the LBUM achieved higher AUC than MTL did on 15 out of 30Abs ( Table 2 ). The LBUM also scored better in terms PRUC than MTL did on 16 out of 30Abs ( S ). In terms of Log the LBUM scored better than MTL on 15 out of 30Abs ( S ). The results show that the LBUM outperforms classical machine learning models and MTL models in predicting HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs, and addresses the challenges of underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and co-resistance between antibodies. The model can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy. The code is available at https://github. com/ia/LBUM.

    Title: 
    Article: Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression. The present study considered two strategies that construct predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting. We considered three methods for pathway score calculation ( ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores ) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM ( GSE136324 ) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation. The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data. We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction. The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information ( Vax ( grp ) ) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including VAX pathways, seemed to be more predictive for MM. Vax ( grp ) also outperformed the previously published models. Moreover, the new model was more resistant to missing values, and the presence of missing values ( <5% ) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method. In a nutshell, pathway-based models ( using group lasso ) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM. These models were documented in an R package ( https://github. com/ShuoStat/MMMs ), where a missing data imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation. 
 Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in bone marrow [1–3]. Multiple myeloma ( MM ) usually starts from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( MGUS ), progresses to symptomatic multiple myeloma ( SMM ), and ultimately develops into MM. Approximately 1% of MGUS and 10% of SMM will progress to MM each year [4, 5]. Many treatments have been approved for MM, but the prognosis varies between patients [6, 7]. Predictive models can help distinguish the patients of high risk for therapeutic decision-making [8]. Several models have been proposed either based on clinical information or based on gene expression data [9–11]. However, few of them have been applied in practice for several reasons, including insufficient predictive accuracy, lack of generalization to the whole population, and poor model reporting [10, 12, 13]. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level. Indeed, the development of disease involves the dysfunction of biological pathways, where clusters of genes collaborate to perform specific functions [14]. Hence, incorporating pathway information in model building can provide more accurate representations of disease progression [15]. In addition, gene-based models ( particularly sparse models ) encounter challenges when applied to other datasets due to genetic heterogeneity and measurement errors [8]. However, pathway-based models are considered to be more robust to uncontrolled variation as they incorporate well-established prior knowledge which can significantly reduce the variance caused by noise variables [16, 17, 11]. Furthermore, pathway-based models are usually more interpretable due to their inherent biological relevance [8, 18]. The selected pathway models can directly reflect the relevance between biological functions ( instead of individual genes ) and survival outcomes. Moreover, these selected pathways can be the clues guiding the research of biological mechanisms and precise medicine. In this light, the present study explored two possible strategies that incorporated pathway information in model building: pathway score methods ( including ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-score ) and group lasso. We implemented these methods in several MM data, investigating their properties and comparing their prediction performance with the gene-based model and previously published models. Our benchmark results demonstrated clear advantage of pathway-based models in clinical outcome prediction. Our computational workflow can also serve as a comprehensive guidebook for future studies where prior knowledge needs to be incorporated into predictive models. 
 We used three microarray datasets derived from Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO, https://www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/geo/ ), with the data of the largest effective sample size being the training data ( GSE136324 ), and the rest two being the test data ( GSE9782 and GSE2658 ). All three data were derived from prospective studies with overall survival by months as endpoints. Probes were removed if i ) they did not target any gene symbol or targeted multiple symbols; ii ) the targeted genes were not available in all three datasets because the external validation required the training data and test data to have the same data structure. Finally, we included 11, 485 genes. GSE136324 enrolled patients received the Total Therapy ( TT ) 3–5 during 2004–2014 [4, 19–21]. It contains 867 samples from 436 patients, out of which 298 were repeatedly measured ( Table 1 ). The initial measurements were used for the patients who were repeatedly measured. This process yielded 436 samples, including 266 males and 170 females. The follow-up time ranged from 0 to 174 months ( median 92 months ), and events were observed in 191 samples ( 43. 8% ). The gene expression profile was normalized with MAS5. 0 and transformed into log2 scale. No missing value was observed. GSE9782 was generated from a multiple-centered clinical trial of bortezomib covering 12 countries [22]. It enrolled 669 relapsed patients who received one to three prior therapies, of which 264 microarray profiles were accessible ( 159 males and 105 females ). The follow-up time ranged from 2 to 37 months ( median 15 months ). GSE2658 contained 351 newly diagnosed MM cases [23, 24, 3]. The follow-up ranged from 0 to 69 months ( median 23 months ), during which 100 events ( 17. 9% ) were observed. We considered two strategies for model building that incorporate pathway information, namely pathways score method and group lasso. For the former, we employed three methods ( ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-score ) to calculate pathway scores. These methods would be implemented in 14 pathway databases and compared to the gene-based model. The prediction performance was evaluated both in internal validation ( within the same data ) and in external validation ( GSE9782 and GSE2658 ). The purpose of the internal validation was to assess the prediction performance of the models in the data of the same population, while the external validation could assess the reliability of models on the new data probably representing different populations. The workflow of this paper is shown in Fig 1. The pathway score method simply fits models using pathway scores, which are converted from gene expressions based on pre-defined pathway information ( e. g., hallmark pathways ). We considered employing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( Lasso ) for model building. More advanced machine learning methods, such as random forest, gradient boosting, SVM, and so on, or deep learning methods, can also be used for incorporating pathway information into prediction models and may have better performance than simple multiple linear regression. However, we prefer multiple linear regression with Lasso penalty because of its simplicity and interpretability. More sophisticated machine learning or deep learning methods typically require large sample sizes and often face challenges in model interpretability, and therefore not ideal for clinical applications. Nevertheless, our current study in a simple context demonstrates the principles and benefits of incorporating pathway information in outcome prediction and opens up the possibility of building and testing more advanced machine learning/AI methods. ssGSEA is a pathway activity measurement based on gene ranks of individual samples [30]. It measures the rank distance between a predefined gene set and the rest of the genes. ssGSEA has two favorable features: i ) the calculation of ssGSEA entirely relies on gene ranks instead of gene expression values, which is helpful to mitigate batch effects and measurement errors; ii ) the calculation of ssGSEA does not depend on background samples as it merely uses the information of gene ranks. These two features are desirable in practical application because the established model can be easily used for an individual patient without complex data processing ( e. g., normalization ) that requires background samples. Unlike ssGSEA which directly orders genes by expression levels, GSVA calculates the cumulative density function to all other cases after a kernel transformation [25]. The total density is transformed into ranks, which were subsequently used to calculate the enrichment scores. Therefore, the calculation of GSVA relies on the background samples. Gene expressions are standardized over all samples, yielding zij, where i denotes the cases and j refers to the genes belonging to a gene set J [31]. The Z-score for the case i and gene set J is defined as ZiJ=∑j=1Jzij|J| where |J| refers to the number of genes in get J. Obviously, the calculation of Z-score also relies on the background samples. The pathway score method is a two-step procedure involving the pathway score calculation and model fitting. In contrast, group lasso is a one-step procedure that can incorporate pathway information. Group lasso is an extension of Lasso that incorporates group information into the penalty [32, 33]. In grouplasso can be used for both continuous and categorical variables. In this study, we used grouplasso to incorporate pathway information into the model. grouplasso is more flexible than the pathway method because it can handle both continuous and categorical variables, whereas the pathway method can only handle continuous variables. grouplass is also more robust than pathway because it can handle missing values. In this study, we used grouplass to incorporate pathway information into the model and compared with the pathway method. grouplass was more competitive than pathway in both internal and external validation. grouplass also outperformed previously published models. grouplass was more resistant to missing values and the presence of missing ( 5% ) did not deteriorate its accuracy using our imputation method. In nutshell, grouplass incorporating pathway information was competitive to gene-based models for MM. grouplass was implemented in R package ( https://github. com/ShStatMMs/MM ) where missing imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation. grouplass can be used for other diseases where pathway information can be incorporated into model. grouplass can be used for other diseases where pathway information can be incorporated into model. grouplass can be used for other diseases where pathway can be incorporated into model. grouplass can be used for other diseases where pathway can be incorporated into model. group can be used for diseases where pathway can be incorporated into model. group can be used for where pathway can be incorporated into model. group can be used where can be incorporated into model. group can be where incorporated into model. group can be into model.

    Title: 
    Article: Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission. We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one, μ. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases. Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+, k−, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic target selection. 
 Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that maintain a steady-state through three general processes: mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics ( fission and fusion ) [1–6]. Upon acute stress, mitochondria can undergo hyperfission resulting in an increase in fragmentation, which shifts their size distribution [7]. These fragmented mitochondria have decreased ATP production, decreased oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxygen species production, and an increased susceptibility to programmed cell death [8] [7]. Moreover, inhibition of mitochondrial hyperfission can blunt the impact of cellular injury. In cardiomyocyte-like HL1 cells, through the inhibition of fission signaling ( including cyclin dependent kinases Cdk 1, 2 and 5 ), roscovitine protects cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro [8]. Further in vivo studies in rats demonstrate that inhibiting hyperfission in early stages of ischemia protect against long-term ischemic injury including a decrease in infarct size and improvement in function [9]. In male mice, studies demonstrate inhibition of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission by the outer mitochondrial AKAP1/PKA complex protects neurons from ischemic stroke [10]. However, deletion of key mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins ( Mff or Drp1 ) results in heart failure [11]. Disruptions in the balance between fission and fusion has also been observed to affect normal development, and these disruptions have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases [12] indicating that a balance between fission and fusion is crucial to cell health across diverse cell types. Drp1 is a key player in mitochondrial fission through its interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) [13–17]. Drp1 is recruited to the OMM and binds to membrane receptors such as mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ), MiD49, and MiD51 [13, 17–20]. The receptor Mff is essential for recruiting Drp1 to mitochondria [17], and over-expression of Mff increases mitochondrial fission while over expression of MiD49 and MiD51 inhibits fission [13, 20]. For these reasons, the nonlinear dynamical systems described below focus on Drp1 and Mff interactions. Drp1 oligomerizes to form a chain like structure, an oligomer, which wraps around the mitochondria leading to a fission event. While Drp1 recruitment, oligomerization, and interaction with outer mitochondrial membrane receptors is known to occur [13, 18, 19], the specific contributions of these processes to the fission rate is incompletely understood. Therefore there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating mitochondrial dynamics. We develop a nonlinear dynamical system for a Drp1-dependent fission mechanism and use parameter sensitivity analyses, bifurcation analysis, and a nondimensionalization of the model to identify which parameters have the greatest effect on the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR is the number of fission events per second. We will refer to our nonlinear dynamical system as the Fission Model. The TFR defined from the nondimensionalization of the Fission Model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k -, where M is the total concentration on Mff; k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively, between oligomers and single Drp1-Mff complexes on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The parameter μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Even though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the cumulative total fission ( TF ), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, depends strongly on only one of them, μ. Thus we identify μ to be a key regulatory parameter for Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission. 
 Mitochondrial fission is the process of a mitochondrion dividing into two daughter organelles. The Fission Model presented here is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) which focus on Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission following cellular injury when the concentration of Drp1 in the cytosol is increased. The mechanism our model approximates begins with the recruitment and binding of cytosolic Drp1 tetramers with Mff anchored to the OMM via its hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain. Since Drp1 exists in a predominately tetrameric form in the cytosol [14], the model focuses on the recruitment of Drp1 tetramers. Fig 1B shows GFP tagged Drp1 encircling the mitochondria, which illustrates the recruitment phase of the mechanism. Fig 1D shows red mitochondria encircled with a cyan ring structure where the cyan color is from the overlay of green Drp1 and blue Mff. This illustrates Drp1-Mff interactions on the OMM. The model tracks the concentration of these Drp1-Mff complexes as they build oligomers of various sizes. Once an oligomer reaches a sufficient size, which will be discussed in more detail later, a fission event occurs. After a fission event, Drp1 tetramers and Mff proteins instantly return to their respective unbound pools within the model ( Fig 2 ). The Fission Model is a common pool model and represents the fission activity of an entire cell. Therefore, the concentration of Mff on the OMM is the concentration across all mitochondria. The model focuses on the oligomerization process in order to better understand how changes upstream of a fission event affect the number of fission events per second. The variables and parameters that makeup the Fission Model are The size of an oligomer refers to the number of Drp1-Mff complexes that makeup the oligomer. Oligomers of size i ≥ 2 on the OMM are assembled/disassembled one complex at a time, e. g. an oligomer of size four is formed from the association of a C3 and a C1 or the dissociation of a C1 from a C5. For i ≥ 1, the following reaction equation expresses the oligomerization process, C i + C 1 ⇆ k + k - C i + 1. ( 1 ) Note that the association rate k+ and dissociation rate k− do not depend on the size of the oligomer. Hence a C1 is just as likely to bind to an oligomer of size five as to an oligomer of size twenty and likewise for the unbinding process. The oligomer construction process along with the assumption that k+ and k− are constant are motivated by the Drp1 oligomerization model in [14] and an actin filamentation model seen in [21]. Fig 3 is a reaction schematic of the model including recruitment, binding of Drp1 to Mff, oligomerization, and finally fission. Within the mechanism, Drp1 travels from the cytosol to the OMM and back to the cytosol, so the Fission Model can be thought of as a compartmental model; one compartment is the cytosol, and the other compartment is the OMM. The two compartments have different effective spaces, so the Fission Model involves a dimensionless spatial correction term γ, which is the ratio of the effective space of the OMM to the effective space of the cytosol. Since the cytosol has a larger effective space than the OMM, the recruitment of Drp1 tetramers to the OMM minimally affects the concentration of Drp1 in the cytosol. Thus the cytosolic concentration of Drp1 ( T ) changes much more slowly over time compared to concentrations on the OMM. Using the law of mass action, we can build a system of nonlinear ODEs based off Fig 3. There are three terms in Eq ( 2 ) that track the fluctuations in the concentration of cytosolic Drp1, the concentration of Dr1ff on the OMM, and the size of oligomers on the OMM. The first term in Eq 2 represents the recruitment of Dr1 tetramers from the cytos to the OMM. The second term represents the dissociation of Dr1ff from the O to the cytos. The third term represents the change in size of oligomers on the O due to association and dissociation of Dr1-Mff complexes. The system of ODEs in Eq 2 is the Fission Model, a nonlinear dynamical system of Dr1-dependent mitochondrial fission. The F Model is a system of three nonlinear ODEs with parameters k+, k, M, γ, and initial conditions. The parameters k and k are the association and dissociation rates between Dr1-Mff on the OMM, M is the concentration of Mff on the O, and γ is the ratio of the effective space of the O to the effective of the cytos. The initial conditions are the initial concentrations of Dr1 in the cytos and on the O and the initial size of oligomers on the O. The system of ODE in Eq 2 can be solved numerically to find the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The FR is the number of fission events per second. The FR can be nondimensionalized by dividing by the maximum rate of fission. The nondimensional FR undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k M - k, where M is the concentration of M and k and k are the association and dissociation rates between Dr1-Mff on the O. The bifurcation parameter μ can be thought of as the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers. The nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, but we found that the cumulative fission ( TF ) which is the total number of fission over a set period depends only on one parameter, μ. The TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases. Instead, it increases to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotonic dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting k, k, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters such as μ may assist in future therapeutic selection. 
The Fission Model can be used to identify which parameters have the greatest effect on the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The FR is the number of fission events per second. The FR can be nondimensionalized by dividing by the maximum of fission. The nondimensional undergoes a Hop bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k M -, where is the concentration of M and k and k are the association and dissociation rates between Dr1-M on the O. The parameter can be thought of as the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers. The nondimensional of the system results in fourless parameters, but we found the cumulative fission ( TF ) which is the number of f over a period depends only on.

    Title: 
    Article: CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles. One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs. In this study, we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest. Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets. We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. 
 Gene drive is a novel genetic engineering tool for controlling disease transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive has broad application prospects due to its high specificity and flexibility. It functions by biasing the inheritance of specific genes to ensure their widespread transmission across successive generations. Current CRISPR-based gene drives consist of three key components: a Cas9 endonuclease gene, one or multiple gRNAs, and a marker gene. Once the target site on a homologous chromosome is cleaved, the gene-drive element is inserted into the double-stranded break ( DSB ) through homology-directed repair ( HDR ), utilizing the drive-bearing homologous chromosome as a template for repair [1]. If this process of directional gene conversion, also known as homing, is highly efficient, the drive allele will be inherited in a manner that surpasses typical Mendelian inheritance patterns ( >50% ). Under ideal conditions, the gene drive elements will eventually spread throughout the population. In fact, Anopheles mosquitoes engineered with CRISPR-based gene-drive have achieved close to 100% inheritance of the desired allele across successive generations [2]. However, the emergence of resistance alleles through end-joining can inhibit the drive, blocking recognition by the gRNAs and potentially maintaining gene function [3–6]. It should be noted that in this research we use the term "resistance" broadly refer to alleles formed by end-joining repair, causing mutations that prevent their cleavage by the drive. In some lab experiments, resistance to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing drives arise rapidly, especially when using a single gRNA [3, 4, 7]. Thus, a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can slow down the development of resistance alleles because any sequence alternation, including in-frame indels, would incur substantial fitness costs [2]. Because the drive itself causes recessive female sterility, another important technical aspect of this approach is how to keep large-scale rearing for area-wide releases with a homing suppression element that would otherwise crash due to female sterility. Intriguingly, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have unveiled the potential of a specific target gene, tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ). This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of octopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including egg laying [8]. A single point mutation in the active site of Tdc2, disrupting the production of octopamine in the nervous system, results in female sterility due to impaired oviductal contractions and egg retention in homozygous females, while heterozygotes are normal [9]. More importantly, this characteristic can be restored through octopamine feeding, indicating that Tdc2 is a potential target for gene drives and enabling conditional rescue of the homozygous drive phenotype [9]. Drosophila suzukii, also known as spotted wing drosophila ( SWD ), is a major agricultural pest. Female SWD have specialized serrated ovipositors, which can lay eggs directly into ripe fruits with soft skins such as strawberries and grapes. The sterile insect technique ( SIT ) has been successfully employed for the widespread suppression of pests, including SWD, by releasing a substantial excess of sterile males in a repeated manner at a ratio of at least 10:1 [10, 11]. Due to the high costs of implementing SIT over large areas, genetic suppression through gene drive technology may be a more favorable option for controlling SWD populations. Targeting the female-specific exon of the dsx gene, a recently created CRISPR/Cas9-based split gene drive ( sGD ) system in SWD showed 94–99% transmission rates with a line that expressed Cas9 with two nuclear localization sequences from the D. suzukii nanos promoter. It was effective at population suppression in mathematical simulations with continuous releases of more modest size ( 1:4 ) [12]. This study reports the development of a novel CRISPR-based homing gene drive system targeting the Tdc2 gene with the previously untested vasa promoter in SWD. We demonstrated conditional rescue of the Tdc2 mutant phenotype by feeding octopamine and showed moderate levels of gene drive efficiency that specifically target the Tdc2 locus. We also conducted additional experiments in D. melanogaster to further characterize this drive system. These findings suggest potential applications of Tdc2-targeting gene drives for SWD population management, paving the way for more effective and sustainable pest control strategies. 
 We first analyzed the genomic structure of SWD Tdc2 locus and selected three gRNAs with spacing between them ranging from 50–150 bp to decrease functional resistance generation and possibly improve drive efficiency [13–15] ( Fig 1A ). Next, we identified and synthesized the SWD vasa promoter for efficient germline expression of SpCas9 ( S1A Fig ). Homing-based suppression requires high rates of homing and low maternal carryover cleavage to prevent fitness costs and the appearance of a high frequency of NHEJ resistant alleles [3]. While the vasa promoter is known to have high levels of somatic expression in D. melanogaster and mosquitoes, it has not been tested in SWD. According to the D. melanogaster vasa promoter [16] and the sequence information in vasa-Cas9 transgenic flies [17], we found that the commonly used D. melanogaster vasa promoter uses the 5’ UTR region in both the first and second exons, up to the start codon on the latter and excluding the intron. In contrast, the start codon of SWD vasa is on the fourth exon. Therefore, the 5´UTR region ( 112bp ) on the first exon, 5´UTR region ( 19bp ) on the fourth exon and 5´ upstream sequences ( 1292bp ) before the first exon of SWD vasa were selected as the vasa promoter region ( S1B Fig ). Finally, a donor plasmid containing left and right homologous arms, tRNA-gRNAs driven by the D. melanogaster U6:3 promoter, SpCas9 endonuclease with its vasa promoter sequence, and DsRed marker expressed through the whole body under the control of the D. melanogaster PUb promoter [18] was constructed to fulfill our gene drive system ( Fig 1B ). After microinjection and primary outcross with wild-type ( WT ) SWD, flies that showed red fluorescence in the body were selected and named as DsTdc2CRISPR ( Fig 1C ). PCR amplification from genomic DNA using diagnostic primers that indicate correct transgene integration in the Tdc2 locus was performed to confirm that the gene drive element was inserted in the target locus ( Fig 1D ). The successful acquisition of mutants through microinjection showed that the SWD vasa promoter is functional in expressing Cas9, as observed from the outcomes when only the donor plasmid was injected without any additional Cas9 protein. To test whether our gene drive system functions in SWD, we crossed DsTdc2CRISPR flies with WT SWD, and the inheritance rate of the gene drive cassette was calculated by counting the number of individuals with red fluorescence among the offspring ( Fig 2A ). We produced another transgenic SWD without Cas9 and gRNA elements as a control ( S2 Fig ). The DsRed marker was inserted at the same position in the Tdc2 locus, and such flies were named as DsTdc2DsRed. Males with this allele were crossed with WT female SWD ( Fig 2B ), and their offspring showed around Mendelian inheritance ( 48. 2%, P = 0. 5535, Fisher’s Exact Test ). We established 26 vials containing heterozygous DsTdc2CRISPR males crossed with 10 WT female flies. These heterozygous males were regarded as the G1 generation, and their resulting offspring constituted the G2 generation. As a result, an average of 2. 5% of the G2 progeny showed red fluorescence ( Fig 2C ), indicating a low level of homing in the germline. However, when the G1 heterozygous males were crossed with homozygous T2 females, an average of 8. 5% of the G2 progeny showed red fluorescence ( Fig 2D ), indicating a higher level of homing in the germl. We also tested the effect of octopamine feeding on the T2 mutant phenotype by crossing heterozygous males with homozyg T2 females and feeding the offspring with octamine. As a result, the egg-laying defects were restored in T2 females ( Fig 2E ), indicating the conditional rescue of the T2 mutant phenotype. To test the effectiveness of our system in D. melanogaster, we constructed a similar CRISPR homing drive targeting the T2 gene with the D melanog vasa promoter. The drive system consisted of a plasmid with left and right homolog arms, gRNAs driven by the D melan U:3 promoter, Sp9 endonuc with the melan vasa sequence, and DRed expressed under the control of the melan PUb promoter ( Fig 3A ). After microinjection and outcross with WT D melanog, the red fluorescence in the body were selected and named DmT2CRPR ( Fig 3 ) PCR amplification from genomic DNA using diagnostic primers confirmed the correct integration of the gene element in the T2 locus ( Fig 3 ). The acquisition of mutants through microinjection showed the D melan vasa is functional in expressing Cas, as observed from outcomes when only the plasm was injected without any Cas protein. To test the drive functions in D melan, we crossed Dm2CRPR flies with WT melan and the inheritance of the gene cassette was calculated by counting the number of individuals with fluorescence among offspring ( Fig 4 ) We produced transgenic melan without Cas and g elements as control ( Fig 4 ) The DRed was inserted at same in T2, and flies named as Dm2Red Males with this allele crossed with WT melan ( Fig 4 ) and their offspring showed Mendelian ( 48. 2, P = 0. 5, Fisher’s Exact ). We established vials containing heterozygous Dm2CR males with 10 WT females. Heterozygous males were regarded as G generation and their offspring constituted G. As result an average 2. 5 of G progeny showed red ( Fig 4 ) indicating low homing in germl. However, when G heterozy males were crossed with homo T females an average 8. 5 of progeny showed red ( Fig 4 indicating higher homing germl. We also tested effect of octamine on T phenotype by crossing heterozy with homo T and feeding offspring with. As result egg defects were restored in T ( Fig 4 indicating conditional rescue T phenotype. To further improve homing efficiency, we constructed additional CRPR drives by introducing promoter-C9 transgenes to the system ( Fig 5 ). The drives consisted of plasm with left and right homolog arms gRNAs driven by D U: promoter Sp9 with vasa sequence and DRed under control of P ( Fig 5 ) After microinjection and outcross with WT melan the red in body were selected and named DmCR ( Fig 5 PCR from genomic DNA using diagnostic primers confirmed correct integration of gene in T2 ( Fig 5 ) The acquisition mutants through microin showed D vasa is functional expressing Cas as from outcomes when only pl was injected without Cas. To test drive in melan we DmCR with WT and inheritance of cassette calculated by counting number individuals with fluorescence offspring ( Fig 5 We produced transgenic without Cas and

    Title: 
    Article: The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation, but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories. Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates, already carries a significant metabolic cost. Yet, learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to require at least 108 synaptic updates. Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates, and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires, yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses. In particular in this case, large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity. The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly. 
 Energy availability is a vital necessity for biological organisms. The nervous system is a particularly intensive energy consumer. Though it constitutes approximately 2% of human body mass, it is responsible for roughly 20% of basal metabolism—continuously consuming some 20W [1, 2]. Energy requirements of neural signaling are now widely seen as an important design constraint of the brain. Sparse codes and sparse connectivity ( pruning ) can be used to lower energy requirements [3]. Learning rules have been designed that yield energy efficient networks [4, 5]. However, learning itself is also energetically costly: in classical conditioning experiments with flies the formation of long-term memory reduced lifespan by 20% when the flies were subsequently starved [6]. Moreover, starving fruit flies halt long-term memory formation; nevertheless forcing memory expression reduced their lifespan [7]. We have estimated the cost of learning in fruitflies at 10mJ/bit [8]. These costs are not restricted to flies. In mammals there is physiological evidence that energy availability gates long lasting forms of plasticity [9]. Furthermore, in humans there is behavioral evidence for a correlation between metabolism and memory [10, 11]. Given this evidence, we hypothesize that biological neural plasticity is designed to be energy efficient. Including energy constraints could lead to computational learning rules more closely resembling biology, and a better understanding of observed synaptic plasticity rules. As precise metabolic cost models for plasticity are not yet available, we aim at algorithmic principles rather than energy efficient biophysical mechanisms. We introduce an abstract energy measure that assumes the energy is solely used by the synaptic updates. Costs for synaptic transmission and global costs independent of the number of synapses are ignored ( see Discussion ). We examine how this energy measure can be reduced while maintaining overall learning performance. Our study is inspired by experimental observations that despite common fluctuations in synaptic strength, the number of synapses undergoing permanent modification appears restricted. First plasticity is spatially limited, e. g. during motor learning plasticity is restricted to certain dendritic branches [12]. Second, plasticity is temporally limited, e. g. it is not possible to induce late-phase LTP twice in rapid succession [13, 14]. This stands in stark contrast with traditional backprop which updates every synapse on every trial and, as we shall see, can lead to very inefficient learning. We use artificial neural networks as a model of neural learning. While neural networks trained with back-propagation are an abstraction of biological learning, it allows for an effective way to teach networks complex associations that is currently not matched by more biological networks or algorithms. Biological implementations of back-propagation have been suggested, e. g. [15], but it is likely that these are less energy efficient as learning times are typically longer. In artificial neural network research there is a similar interest in limiting plasticity, but typically for other reasons. Carefully selecting which synapses to modify can prevent overwriting previously stored information, also known as catastrophic forgetting [16]. Randomly switching plasticity on and off can help regularization, as in drop-out and its variants [17]. Communication with the memory systems is also energetically costly in computer hardware. Strikingly, storing two 32-bit numbers in DRAM is far more expensive than multiplying them [18]. Recent studies have started to explore algorithms that reduce these costs by limiting the updates to weight matrices [18, 19]. 
 As data set we use the standard MNIST digit classification task. In the MNIST task 28x28 grey-scale images of handwritten digits need to be classified according to the digit they represent ( ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, … ). Similar results were found on the fashionMNIST data set. The data were offset so that the mean input was zero. This common pre-processing step is important. Namely, when trained with backprop, the weight update to weight wij between input xj to a unit i with error δi is Δ w i j = - ϵ δ i x j where ϵ is the learning rate which was adjusted to approximately minimize energy consumption ( see below ). For a mean square error cost function, the error in the output layer is δi = g′ ( hi ) ( yi − ti. ), where hi is the net input to the unit, g ( ) the activation function, y the unit’s output, and t it’s target value; while in the hidden layer one uses the back-propagated error δi = g′ ( hi ) ∑j wijδj. As the weight update is proportional to the input value xj, there is no plasticity for zero-valued inputs, even when δi ≠ 0. However, this could be a confounding factor as we would like to be in full control of the number of plasticity events. After zero-meaning the inputs, only a negligible number of inputs will be exactly zero and this issue does not arise. Reassuringly, the relative savings achievable are not substantially affected by this assumption, Fig A in S1 Text. We used a network with 784 input units ( equal to the number of MNIST pixels ) with bias, a variable number of hidden units in a single hidden unit layer, and 10 output units ( one for each digit ), Fig 1a. Networks had all-to-all, non-convolutional connectivity. The hidden layer units used a leaky rectifying linear activation function ( lReLU ), so that g ( x ) = x if x ≥ 0, and otherwise g ( x ) = βx with β = 0. 1. A common alternative activation function is the rectified linear function, g ( x ) = max ( 0, x ). However, this activation function would lead to a substantial fraction of neurons with zero activation in the hidden layer on a given sample and turn off plasticity of many synapses between hidden and output layer. As above, this would potentially be confounding, but it is avoided by using ‘leaky’ units. This did not substantially change the savings achievable, Fig A in S1 Text. The activation of the ten output units is used to train the network. The target distribution was one-hot encoding of the image labels. For classification tasks it is common to apply a soft-max non-linearity yi = exp ( hi ) /∑j exp hj, where hi is the net input to each unit, so that the output activities represent a normalized probability distribution. One then trains the network by minimizing the cross entropy loss between the output distribution and the target distribution. However, it is easy to see that when the target is a deterministic one-hot ( 0 and 1 ) distribution, the cross entropy loss only vanishes in the limit of diverging hi, which in turn requires diverging weights. As cross-entropy loss minimization is therefore energy inefficient, we used linear output units and minimized the mean squared error between output and target. This did not substantially change the achievable savings, Fig A in S1 Text. We used the backpropagation learning algorithm to train the network. Weights were initialized with small Gaussian values ( σ = 0. 01 ). The energy measures depend only weakly on it, but very small values will slow down initial training and very large values would require learning to reduce them. In preliminary simulations, regularization was seen to have no significant effect on energy or savings, and was subsequently omitted. Samples were presented in a random order. Because batching would require storing synaptic updates across samples, which would be biologically challenging, the training was not batched and the synaptic weights were updated after every sample. We did not find substantial energy savings when using adaptive learning schemes such as ADAM. As such schemes would furthermore be hard to implement biologically, we instead fixed the learning rate. Every 1000 samples training was interrupted and performance on a validation data set was measured. As a reasonable compromise between performance and compute requirements, networks were always trained until a validation set accuracy criterion of 95% was achieved. Our approach requires a model of the metabolic energy needed for learning. It is currently not known why the metabolic cost of some forms of plasticity is so high, nor is it known which process is the main consumer. In flies persistent, protein synthesis dependent memory is much more costly than protein synthesis independent forms of memory. One could presume that protein synthesis itself is the main consumer, but this is not the case [20], 21. We assume that the energy is solely used by synaptic updates. This is a simplification, as energy is also used by other processes such as transmission. However, we ignore these costs as they are independent of the number of synapses and do not affect our results. The energy is calculated as the number of synaptic updates times the energy per update. The energy per update is estimated from the number of synapses updated times the energy per synaptic update. The energy per synaptic update is estimated from the number of neurons times the energy per neuron. The energy per neuron is estimated from the number of synapses times the energy per synapse. The energy per synapse is estimated from the number of updates times the energy update. The energy update is estimated from the number of synapses times the energy synapse. The energy synapse is estimated from the number of neurons times the synapse. The synapse is estimated from the number of synapses the synapse.

    Title: 
    Article: Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors. Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life. During natural or engineered genome streamlining, deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons. We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ), csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ), and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains, though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function. More generally, our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments. 
 Genome streamlining is a process of genome reduction in which unnecessary or detrimental genes are lost or removed, resulting in a simpler genome. Gene loss occurs naturally in many microorganisms, including symbionts [1] and pathogens [2], that live in stable, nutrient-rich environments where genes encoding ancillary metabolic pathways are unnecessary. However, little is known about the detailed dynamics of natural streamlining, as most of our understanding of genome reduction comes from comparing the very different genomes of endosymbionts and their free-living relatives [3]. Two types of approaches have been used to experimentally study genome streamlining [4–7]. Top-down approaches are similar to natural processes in that they start with a free-living organism and sequentially delete non-essential pieces of its genome. This procedure has achieved various degrees of genome reduction in many bacterial and fungal species, including deleting up to 38. 9% of the Escherichia coli genome [8]. The other approach, bottom-up design, assembles the DNA for a minimal chromosome de novo and then inserts it into a recipient cell to produce a synthetic organism. This procedure has been used to create Mycoplasma mycoides strains with extremely reduced genomes [9] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with up to six and a half synthetic chromosomes [10]. It has been argued that streamlined genomes provide two major benefits to synthetic biology: removing genes that are detrimental in an environment of interest and reducing the complexity of cellular networks [4–7]. Most genomes encode pathways that are unnecessary in laboratory, bioreactor, or host environments; and these additional genes can negatively impact a desired phenotype. For example, genomes have been engineered to remove genes that cause autolysis [11] or block DNA uptake [12] to improve cell survival and competence, respectively. Other deletions, such as removing transposons, can also lower mutation rates [12–14]. Streamlining can be especially beneficial for metabolic engineering, when extraneous pathways redirect resources away from a desired product [7], as has been shown by deleting genes to increase antibiotic production in Streptomyces avermitilis [15] and recombinant protein production in Pseudomonas putida [16] and Lactococcus lactis [17]. Removing genes eliminates their interactions with remaining genes, simplifying modeling of metabolic and regulatory networks, especially when genes of unknown function are deleted. Reducing cellular complexity in this way should make engineering more predictable [7]. The potential benefits of genome streamlining, however, may come at a cost. Removing what have been called "quasi-essential" genes [9] can result in fitness defects due to disrupting metabolic networks [18], reducing stress tolerance [8, 14], or perturbing global gene expression [18], among other possibilities. Deletion of multiple, large genomic regions can also remove genes that individually have little impact on a cell’s function but when removed together produce synthetic lethality [9, 19] or are more deleterious than expected due to "synthetic-sick" interactions [14]. Because of our incomplete understanding of the consequences of deleting genes in top-down streamlined strains, laboratory evolution has been used as a means to recover lost fitness [14, 18]. This strategy often works for single-gene deletions: they acquire mutations that compensate for the lost function [20, 21]. Less is known about whether and when strains with many genes deleted at once can recover wild-type fitness through laboratory evolution. Short evolution experiments were able to partially restore the fitness of hypermutator strains of Salmonella typhimurium after they spontaneously accumulated mutations that included deletions of tens to hundreds of kilobases [22]. Different outcomes have been reported, however, after evolving strains of E. coli [18] and Bacillus subtilis [14] with cumulative engineered deletions comprising ~20–30% of their genomes. The E. coli strain wholly recovered fitness lost in minimal medium, primarily through rewiring metabolic and regulatory networks [18]. The B. subtilis strain exhibited more limited fitness recovery [14]. In light of these results, questions still remain about the impact of large deletions on an organism’s fitness and how and whether laboratory evolution can recover lost fitness after this type of genome reduction. Previously, we engineered strains of the metabolically versatile and naturally competent bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx with deletions of large genome segments that each encoded ≥17 nonessential genes [23]. In this study, we evolved replicate populations of eight reduced-genome strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx in complex and defined medium laboratory environments. Deletions in these strains were constructed without examining the functions or expression levels of the genes being removed, which resulted in substantial fitness defects in some cases. Nevertheless, evolution restored fitness, at least partially, in most instances. Whole-genome sequencing revealed examples of both deletion-specific and shared genetic targets that recurrently evolved mutations in different populations. The most widespread mutations affected genes in a post-transcriptional global regulatory network. They appear to recapitulate or phenocopy a transposon insertion in the csrA gene in A. baylyi ADP1 that was removed during construction of the transposon-free ADP1-ISx progenitor strain. However, even in these cases, the effects of mutations within this network on gene function varied with the deletion strain and environment in which they evolved. Overall, our results validate laboratory evolution as a strategy for improving the fitness of reduced-genome strains, and they illuminate a path forward for engineering a minimal-genome A. baylyi strain. 
 Previously, we created Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx [13] by deleting all transposable elements from the genome of the laboratory strain ADP1 [24]. Then, we examined possibilities for additional genome streamlining by attempting to construct 55 multiple-gene deletion ( MGD ) strains from ADP1-ISx [23]. Each of the 18 MGD strains that were successfully constructed has a single contiguous stretch of nonessential genes removed. For this study, we selected six of these MGD strains ( MGD4, MGD6, MGD9, MGD12, MGD15, and MGD17 ) with deletions ranging in size from 21. 8 to 41. 7 kb that removed from 17 to 47 genes ( Fig 1A ). We also examined a retained genome region ( RGR ) strain with a partially successful deletion, leading to loss of only six genes ( RGR7 ), as an additional wild-type-like control, and two multiple-segment deletion ( MSD ) strains ( MSD1 and MSD2 ) that were created by combining or expanding deletions in the original MGD strains. Strain MSD1 had the most-reduced genome, with a total of 293. 5 kb and 268 genes removed, including a ribosomal RNA operon. MSD2 has a deletion of 69. 8 kb that expands upon one of the original MGD segments ( MGD11 ). It removes 67 genes. To examine how the large deletions affected bacterial fitness, we constructed a GFP-expressing variant of ADP1-ISx. Then, we performed co-culture competition assays comparing this reference strain to each MGD strain and the ADP1-ISx progenitor in a complex medium ( LB ) ( Fig 1B ) and a defined minimal succinate medium ( MS ) ( Fig 1C ). The six MGD ancestor strains had fitness defects of 17. 0% on average and up to 49. 9% in LB compared to AD1x ( Fig 1B ). However, in MS ( Fig 1C ) only two of the MGD strains ( M4 and M9 ) had reduced fitness compared to AD1x. In contrast, the R7 strain had fitness similar to AD1 in both media ( Fig 1B and 1 ). The MSD1 and MSD2 strains had reduced fitness in LB ( Fig 1 ) but not MS ( Fig 1 ) compared to AD1x. These results indicate that the impact of large deletions on fitness varies with environment. We then evolved populations of each of the six MGD strains in LB and MS for ~300 generations and sequenced the genomes of endpoint isolates. Mutations in protein-coding genes and small RNAs were significantly associated with fitness in both environments ( Table 1 and 2 ). Mutations in the global postcriptional regulatory network were frequent across all strains ( Table 1 and 2 ), but their effects on gene function and fitness varied with the deletion and environment ( Table 1 and 2 ). Mutations in this network likely compensate for the earlier deletion of the transon in the AD1x progenitor of the MGD strains ( Table 1 and 2 ). Overall, our results demonstrate that laboratory evolution can rapidly recover fitness lost through a combination of deletion-specific and global adjustments. Genome streamlining is a process of reducing the genome by removing unnecessary or detrimental genes, resulting in a simpler genome. Gene loss occurs naturally in many microorganisms, including symbionts and pathogens that live in stable, nutrient-rich environments where genes encoding ancillary metabolic pathways are unnecessary. However, little is known about the dynamics of streamlining as most of our understanding comes from comparing the genomes of endosymbts and freeiving relatives. Two approaches have been used to experimentally study streamlining. Top-down approaches start with a freeiving organism and sequentially delete non-essential pieces of its genome. This has achieved various degrees of reduction in many bacterial and fungal species. The other, bottom-up assembles DNA for a minimal chromosome novo and inserts it into recipient to produce synthetic organism. This has created Mycoplasma myoides with reduced genomes and Saccharces cerevisiae with synthetic chromosomes. Streamlined genomes provide two benefits: removing genes detrimental in environment and reducing complexity. Most encode pathways are unnecessary in laboratory or host environments and can negatively impact phenotype. For example, genes have been removed to improve survival and competence. Deletions such as removing transons can lower mutation rates. Stream can be especially beneficial for metabolic when pathways redirect resources away product as shown by deleting to increase production in Streptomyces averilis and recombin protein in Pseudas put and Lactoccus lactis. Removing interactions with genes simplifies modeling and networks especially genes unknown are deleted. Reducing complexity should make engineering predictable. However, benefits may come at cost removing "qu-essential" genes can result defects due disrupting networks reducing stress perturbing expression among possibilities. Deletion large regions can remove genes individually little impact but together produce lethality or more deleterious due "synthetic" interactions. Because of incomplete understanding consequences deleting top-down strains laboratory has been used to recover fitness. This often works single-gene deletions acquire mutations compensate function. Less known whether strains many deleted can recover wild-type through evolution Short experiments restored fitness hypermut strains Salmonella after accumulating deletions tens kilob. Different have been after evolving E coli and Bacillus with cumulative deletions of their genomes The coli recovered in minimal through rewiring networks The subtil exhibited limited recovery In light, questions remain impact large deletions fitness and whether evolution recover lost type reduction. We engineered Acinet bacterium AD1x with deletions large segments each ≥17 genes. This study evolved populations reduced-genome strains ADx in complex defined environments Delet in strains were constructed examining functions expression genes removed

    Title: 
    Article: Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes. Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases. However, their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context. Here, we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. Using an in vivo reporter strategy, we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes. We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we also show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. In addition, we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. Furthermore, we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene. Altogether, we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies. 
 Modulating RNA and protein expression using genetic tools is essential to understand their function in vivo [1]. Spatiotemporal control of gene knockout has become the standard approach in vertebrate model organisms to investigate RNA and protein function. Multiple site-directed tools are available to control gene knockout, including recombinase systems such as Cre/LOX, Flp/FRT, and Dre/ROX, as well as endonuclease-mediated CRISPR editing [2, 3]. However, these systems are not available in all vertebrate models, are challenging to implement, and display variable efficiency depending on the genomic context. Hence, more flexible approaches are needed to control gene expression. The synthetic biology field has contributed several tools to regulate RNA stability [4]. One promising family of RNA regulatory elements consists of self-cleaving ribozymes, which are short RNA structures capable of catalyzing their own cleavage [5]. When inserted in a protein-coding gene, this cleavage leads to RNA degradation and a reduction in protein levels. This approach has been used to modulate transgene stability in multiple models, including human and mouse cells [6–9], C. elegans [10, 11], Drosophila [12], and Plasmodium [13]. One limitation to efficient RNA degradation is the slow cleavage kinetics, which makes most natural self-cleaving ribozymes unsuitable for in vivo applications. To circumvent this issue, an artificial Schistosoma mansoni hammerhead ribozyme, called T3H48, which displays a dramatic increase in cleavage rate has recently been engineered [14]. This ribozyme, as well as related ones [11], have been used to control transgene expression using Cre- and Flp-recombinases [15]. Although this approach has proven to be efficient in regulating exogenous constructs, it remains unclear whether engineered self-cleaving ribozymes can control endogenous gene expression in vertebrates. The zebrafish emerged several decades ago as an alternative and powerful vertebrate genetic model [16]. Most genetic tools involving site-directed recombinases and endonucleases have been successfully implemented in zebrafish [17–19]. Moreover, the zebrafish model allows the efficient screening of genetic tools because of its external fertilization and rapid early development. Here, we use the zebrafish model to establish a self-cleaving ribozyme-based system to knock down gene expression in vivo. We first use a GFP reporter assay to assess the efficiency of several self-cleaving ribozymes in reducing pre-mRNA levels and find that the T3H48 hammerhead ribozyme ( T3H48-HHR ), when placed in an intron, causes a 20-fold reduction in eGFP mRNA. Next, we show that inserting the T3H48-HHR in the second intron of the albino ( alb ) /slc45a2 gene recapitulates the pigmentation phenotype of the alb mutant [20]. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. Furthermore, we created a Flippase- and Cre-inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip, which we also inserted in the alb gene. We show that RiboFlip induction also leads to a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the mutant. Together, these new approaches broaden the genetic toolbox available for functional genomics in vertebrates. 
 The T3H48-HHR and related ribozymes catalyze efficient RNA cleavage in several organisms [9, 11, 14, 15]. However, their efficiency remains untested in a vertebrate model. To do so, we first generated a transgenic cassette that contains two ubiquitous ubb promoters [21] controlling separately an eGFP containing a human β-globin ( hHBB ) intron [22] and mCherry, each followed by a triple SV40 3’UTR to terminate transcription ( Fig 1a ). We injected this transgene at the one-cell-stage and show that the expression of eGFP and mCherry colocalize perfectly ( S1a Fig ). Most ribozyme applications rely on a 3’UTR insertion in a transgene [5]. To maintain the structure of the mature mRNA and increase the number of available landing sites for ribozyme integration, we inserted it in the intron of eGFP. We compared the engineered T3H48 hammerhead ribozyme, its original counterpart, N107, and two other related ribozymes, N79 and N117 [6], along with their catalytically inactive versions [6, 14] ( Figs 1a and S1b ). We used a triple CAAA insulating sequence [10] to isolate the secondary structure of all ribozymes from the neighboring sequences [12] ( S1b Fig ). We measured eGFP mRNA levels and used mCherry as a reference gene to account for the variable number of plasmid copies received after injection. We determined ribozyme activity by assessing the ratio of eGFP mRNA levels between active and inactive versions of each ribozyme. We found that the T3H48-HHR causes a 20-fold reduction in eGFP mRNA levels, in contrast to less than 3-fold for N79, N107, and N117 ( Fig 1b ). We also assessed whether 3 copies of T3H48-HHR, all flanked by triple CAAA insulating sequences, improve cleavage efficiency and in fact observed lower activity compared with a single copy ( Fig 1b ). Moreover, we found that eGFP fluorescence intensity was strongly reduced in embryos injected with the active T3H48-HHR compared with those injected with the inactive version, in contrast to the mCherry signal, which was comparable between all injected embryos ( Fig 1c, d ). Altogether, these data show that the T3H48-HHR is an efficient ribozyme for gene knockdown in zebrafish. Robust reduction in transgenic mRNA levels after ribozyme cleavage has already been shown in other models [9, 10, 12]. Here we investigated whether integrating T3H48-HHR in an endogenous locus could induce phenotypes similar to those observed in the mutant. We targeted the alb gene, whose downregulation leads to strong pigmentation defects [20, 23]. We integrated the active T3H48-HHR in the second intron of the alb gene using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin [18] using an already described CRISPR site [24] ( Figs 2a and S2a ). We flanked the ribozyme with a double CAA insulating sequence ( S1b Fig ), a shorter one than that used in Fig 1 in order to fit it into a 120 bp ssODN donor [18]. We refer to the obtained Pt ( alb:alb-T3H48-HHR ) allele as albHHR hereafter. We found that albHHR/HHR embryos display a 13. 6-fold reduction in alb mRNA levels at 36 hpf ( Fig 2b ). This reduction appears to occur independently of splicing defects, as the alb mRNA displays a wild-type-like size in albHHR/HHR embryos as assessed by an RT-PCR reaction at saturation ( S2b Fig ). Moreover, albHHR/HHR and albHHR/b4 embryos also display a pronounced decrease in pigmentation, similar to the albb4/b4 phenotype ( Fig 2c-f ). The pigmentation phenotype then recovers in albHHR/HHR albHR at 72 hpf ( Fig 2f ), indicating the reversibility of the approach. We used base-editing to inactivate the T3-HHR in albHR allele albHR albHR ( Figs 2g and S3 ) and observed that albHRHR albHR embryos display wild-type pigmentation ( Fig 2h ). This demonstrates the specificity of the ribozyme and the reversibility of the approach. We also generated a Flipp- and Cre-activatable version of T3-HHR, called RFlip ( Figs 3a and S4 ), which we inserted in the alb gene using CRIS/Cas9 ( Figs 3b and S4 ). RFlip induction leads to a pigmentation similar to that of the mutant ( Figs 3c and 4 ). Furthermore, we show that Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS in the RFlip cassette can label cells independently of the expression of the target (igs 3 and 4 ). This demonstrates the potential of RFlip as a tool to control gene expression in vertebrates.

    Title: 
    Article: Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1. 1 million nuclei in 20, 000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e. g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience. 
 Image segmentation—the partitioning of an image into meaningful segments—is fundamental to image analysis. It is usually the first step in image analysis pipelines to identify tissues, cells or subcellular structures to then allow their state quantification or tracking and dynamics quantification [1]. Accurate segmentation is usually crucial for robust automated downstream analyses [2]. While manual image segmentation is considered the gold standard, segmentation for high throughput microscopy requires computer assistance. Conventional computer-assisted image segmentation is semi-automated and necessitates good signal-to-noise, using a dedicated fluorescence channel for segmenting cells, nuclei, or other targets [3–5]. However, dedicating a fluorescence channel to facilitate image segmentation loses a channel that would otherwise be available to image other relevant targets and increases imaging phototoxicity and required acquisition times [6]. Furthermore, adding a transgenic fluorescence marker increases the size of genetic constructs, complicates experimentation and reduces virus packaging and transduction efficiency [7]. Similarly, the time and cost associated with establishing and maintaining a transgenic animal line increases considerably with each additional transgene. Eliminating the need for fluorescent markers for segmenting cellular structures would thus greatly improve imaging experiments. This is made possible by segmenting cells and their compartments in transmitted light images. Albeit visible in transmitted light images, features indicative of even a large organelle like the nucleus are complex, vary between cell types, and over time, for example due to cell differentiation, cell movement or changes in the focal plane. Neural networks excel at discovering complex informative features and are not limited to specific imaging conditions or cell types if trained on a large representative data set [8–11]. Previous research has shown that neural networks can automatically detect nuclei and other sub-cellular structures in high magnification bright field ( BF ) images [12, 13]. Moreover, U-Net has been suggested as a well-suited model architecture for this purpose, potentially even for low magnification imaging [14–16]. However, it is uncertain whether nuclei can be accurately segmented under challenging typical imaging conditions optimized for speed and cells’ health and not for perfect images, such as low magnification BF microscopy. Furthermore, actively maintained, user-friendly software for segmenting nuclei in BF is not available. Consequently, widespread experimental adoption remains elusive. Here, we present “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly software to segment nuclei in BF images accessible even to users with no prior coding experience. We demonstrate its utility even in challenging prevalent conditions, including low magnification live time lapse imaging of primary cells. This includes small hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells lacking prominent and large cell compartments like cytoplasm, also in microfluidic and other culture devices. More specifically, we quantify both technical performance metrics and the preservation of biologically meaningful information such as live single cell signaling dynamics. We show that our trained instance of aiSEGcell is transferable to unseen experimental conditions and adaptable to other use cases, like novel cell types, only requiring 32 images for retraining. Finally, we demonstrate aiSEGcell’s benefits by quantifying an additional fluorescence channel in an experimental setting where the number of biomarkers is limited by their spectral properties. aiSEGcell is accessible through a command line interface ( CLI ) or a graphical user interface ( GUI ), a napari plugin, tested by users with varying coding experience in different computational environments [17]. In addition, we provide the five used data sets, containing more than 20, 000 images, and 1, 100, 000 nuclei, as open access data through a FAIR repository [18]. 
 Conventional cell segmentation approaches use fluorescence to mark cells and cell compartments for segmentation ( Fig 1a ). In contrast, aiSEGcell omits fluorescence markers for segmentation and directly segments BF images ( Fig 1b ). We selected U-Net as the model architecture [12, 14] for aiSEGcell and trained it on 9, 849 BF image and segmentation mask pairs ( >600, 000 nuclei ) of live primary murine hematopoietic cells, like macrophages, stem and progenitor cells, at 20x magnification ( D1 ) [16]. To highlight the need for user-friendly software that segments nuclei in BF, we compared aiSEGcell to widely used nucleus segmentation software Cellpose and StarDist [19, 20]. Available pretrained models for nucleus and BF segmentations were not suitable alternatives to the specialized BF nucleus segmentation of aiSEGcell ( S1 Fig and S1 and S2 Tables ). We evaluated aiSEGcell on a second data set ( D2 ) comprised of 6, 243 image-mask pairs ( >300, 000 nuclei ) derived from five independent imaging experiments with experimental settings similar to D1. Cell morphologies included round cells and more complex shaped cells with protruding pseudopodia. In addition, cell sizes varied by an order of magnitude ( Table 1 ). aiSEGcell segmented nuclei in BF images across morphologically distinct cells and different scales ( Figs 1c and S2a ). We quantified segmentation quality using an adapted version of the F1-score that counted inaccurately predicted objects ( e. g. intersection over union = 0. 4 ) as one error instead of as both, false positive ( FP ), and as false negative ( FN; see Materials and methods ). Therefore, the image-wise average adapted F1-score with an intersection over union ( IOU ) threshold of 0. 6, denoted as F1avg0. 6, more appropriately represented the observed segmentation quality [21]. aiSEGcell nuclear segmentations in BF were quantitatively similar to nuclear marker derived segmentations ( ground truth; F1avg0. 6 = 0. 66 ). Around 70% versus 5% of images had F10. 6≥0. 6 versus F10. 6≤0. 4, illustrating that aiSEGcell segmentations are consistently accurate across challenging typical BF images ( Fig 1d and S3 Table ). Furthermore, we quantified the frequency of oversegmentations ( an object like a nucleus in the ground truth segmentation is split into multiple objects in the aiSEGcell segmentation ) and undersegmentations ( multiple objects in the ground truth segmentation are merged into a single object in the aiSEGcell segmentation ). Only 0. 2 ( s. d. = 0. 5 ) of 50 ground truth nuclei were oversegmented in aiSEGcell segmentations and 0. 2 ( s. d. = 0. 6 ) of 50 nuclei detected in aiSEGcell were merged ground truth nuclei per image on average in D2 ( S4 Table ). Images in D2 were intended for cell tracking and consequently not of high cell density. To evaluate if undersegmentations were more frequent in images dense with cells, we acquired an additional data set ( D7 ) with densely seeded cells. aiSEGcell accurately ( F1avg0. 6 = 0. 80 ) segmented nuclei in BF and undersegmentations rarely occurred. Only 0. 2 ( s. d. = 0. 5 ) out of 50 nuclei detected by aiSEGcell were merged ground truth nuclei per image on average ( S3 Fig and S4 and S5 Tables ). Mask-level performance evaluation of segmentation models may not be relevant to illustrate suitability for downstream applications. Consequently, evaluating segmentation models with respect to biologically meaningful read-outs is necessary. The translocation of fluorescently labeled signaling molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and vice versa, in small motile live primary cells imaged with low signal-to-noise is demanding, sensitive to variations in the nuclear mask and has been shown to affect cell behavior and fate [22–24]. We used a homozygous reporter mouse-line that had all p65 proteins, the transcriptionally active part of the nuclear factor κB ( NfκB ) dimer, tagged with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) to quantify its translocation to the nucleus upon NfκB signaling activation ( Fig 2a ). We imaged highly motile live primary macrophages, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in conditions optimized for cell health and acquisition speed resulting in low signal-to-noise images—a realistic challenging experimental setting that tests segmentation accuracy. aiSEG accurately segmented nuclei in these images ( Figs 2b and S6 ) and preserved biologically meaningful information, e. g. the translocation of p65 to the nucleus ( Figs 2c and S7 ). We quantified the frequency of p65 translocation to the nucleus in aiSEG segmentations and ground truth ( S Table 2 ) and found that aiSEG accurately captured the dynamics of p65 translocation ( Figs 2d and S8 ). In contrast, Cellpose and StarDist failed to segment nuclei in these challenging images ( Figs 2 and S6 ) and S7 and failed to capture p65 translocation (igs 2 and S8 and S Table 2 ). We demonstrate that aiSEG is transferable to other cell types by retraining it on 32 images of a different cell type and evaluating its performance on an unseen data ( D4 ) comprising 2, 000 image-mask pairs (50, 000 nuclei ) of human epithelial cancer cells. aiSEG accurately segmented nuclei in these images ( Figs 9 and S10 ) and preserved biologically meaningful information, e. g. the translocation of p65 to the nucleus (igs 9 and S and S Table 2 ). Finally, we show that aiSEG can be used to quantify an additional channel in an experimental setting where the number of biomarkers is limited by their spectral properties (igs 11 and S11 ). In conclusion, we present aiSEG a user-friendly software for segmenting nuclei in bright field images that is accessible to users with no prior experience. We demonstrate its utility in challenging conditions, including low-magnification live imaging of primary cells and quantify biologically meaningful information, e. g. the translocation of p65 to the nucleus. aiSEG is transferable to other cell types and adaptable to new cases, requiring only 32 images for retraining. We provide the used data, more than 20, 000 images and 1,100, 000 nuclei, as open access through a FAIR repository.

    Title: 
    Article: Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. 
 A remarkable amount of information is reaching our senses at any given time, yet often only a small subset of it is relevant to our current goal. Determining which aspects of our environment are relevant is therefore a crucial challenge for learning goal-directed behaviour. But addressing this challenge is hard. The space of possibilities is often too large to be explored fully within the time limits we need to consider, and yet limiting attention to only a subset of features risks ignoring relevant information [1, 2]. One approach to this problem is to not learn every problem anew, but instead use knowledge of properties that have been relevant in the past as a starting point, in the form of so-called priors, also known as inductive biases [3–7]. Here, we study the role of one such prior in human learning, namely a bias to focus learning on slowly changing features in our environments, and their potential association to rewards. Analogous to the concept of a ‘prior’ in Bayesian statistics, priors are pre-existing beliefs about the underlying structure of an environment, based on generalised past experiences or evolutionary transmission [3, 8]. Previous research has shown that priors can expedite the learning process by focusing information processing on what is common across many environments [4, 9, 10]. The resulting decision-making biases are numerous [10–13] and can for instance be observed in the form of adaptive heuristics that reflect constraints on time or resources [14], or in the form of visual illusions that reflect the simplifying assumptions of our visual system, such as that light tends to come from above [15]. Studying useful priors for representation learning is also an active field of development in artificial intelligence [8, 16–18], in particular for reinforcement learning ( RL ), where knowledge about which actions maximise reward and minimise punishment is acquired through a trial-and-error process [19]. While the RL framework has been very successful in furthering our understanding of learning and decision-making, [20–23], it becomes notoriously inefficient in high dimensional environments [19]. This problem can be alleviated through a process known as representation learning, where learning is limited to a subset of features that help predict future rewards, known as task states [19, 24–28]. The difficulties of learning the state space for each new problem de novo have been widely recognized [29], underscoring the potential benefit of leveraging prior knowledge. A useful prior for reinforcement learning should therefore help quickly build appropriate task states from rich perceptual observations in novel environments [8, 30]. A characteristic shared across many environments is that the causal process generating observations develops on a slower timescale than the sensory signals we observe [31–33]. For example, the appearance of a ball flying toward you in a park might fluctuate rapidly as it passes through patches of sun and shade, but its true colour will remain unchanged. Similarly, other relevant properties such as its speed and trajectory will change in a slower, continuous manner compared to low-level perceptual features. In short, signal tends to vary more slowly than noise [34]. Consequently, slow features are both more predictable, making them easier to learn from, and useful for predicting future observations, therefore warranting greater attention [35, 36]. It follows that a way to extract features relevant to building task states, while remaining impartial to the exact nature of those features or the causal process underlying the perceptual observations, is to focus on slowly changing features. Indeed, some research has shown that humans have a bias toward perceiving slower speeds in the spatial domain [34, 37, 38]. This idea has gained more traction in machine learning, where a slowness prior has been shown to enable the discovery of task states from raw observations [8, 28, 39, 40]. A well-known implementation of this prior is Slow Feature Analysis ( SFA ), an unsupervised learning algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of its input by identifying slowly changing dimensions in the data [31, 41, 42]. SFA first isolates independent components in the data and then extracts those components that change slowly, under the premise that slower features are more meaningful representations of the data [31]. This insight has been shown to be relevant for RL, for instance in the context of a spatial learning task where SFA can provide a effective representation learning mechanism [43]. The same paper showed that the SFA agent produced similar learning trajectories to rats solving a comparable task, underscoring the relevance of a slowness prior for animals. Theoretical research also demonstrated that extracting slow features can explain the activity of complex cells in the visual cortex, the formation of allocentric spatial maps in the hippocampus and can be implemented in a biologically plausible network [44–48]. Hence, a slowness prior promises a domain-general and biologically plausible way to extract task states from environmental input. Despite its potential for representation learning and the abundance of research in the machine learning domain, studies on the slowness prior in human reinforcement learning are largely lacking. Here we explored the idea that humans rely on a slowness prior during reinforcement learning. We developed a novel decision-making task, in which participants had to repeatedly learn which of two stimulus features predicted reward. We manipulated the speed of change of the features and asked whether participants were faster to learn when the relevant feature changed slowly versus when it changed quickly. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, as well as extensive model comparison, our results indicate that they do. This finding enriches our understanding of human inductive biases in RL and can prompt further studies about other such biases in human learning, as well as inform artificial intelligence about how to best build human-like agents. 
 We first analysed participant choices to confirm learning of the feature-reward mapping. Participants’ choice accuracy in the learning phase increased from around chance in the first ten trials of a block to significantly above chance in the last ten trials in all three experiment samples ( experiment 1: start = 52%, end = 67%, t ( 49 ) = 8. 27 p <. 001, experiment 2: start = 51%, end = 74%, t ( 49 ) = 13. 26 p <. 001, replication: start = 51%, end = 75%, t ( 137 ) = 26. 91 p <. 001, Fig 2A ). This increase in accuracy was accompanied by a gradual decrease in ‘accept’ choices throughout the learning phase, reducing from above 85% in the first ten trials to below 65% in the last ten trials across experiments ( experiment 1: start = 85%, end = 64%, t ( 49 ) = −10. 28 p <. 001; experiment 2: start = 87%, end = 62%, t ( 49 ) = −13. 46 p <. 001; replication: start = 88%, end = 58%, t ( 137 ) = −28. 39 p <. 001, Fig 2B ). Note that ‘accept’ choices allowed participants to gather information on stimulus values and therefore were necessary for exploration early in a block. Accordingly, participants learned with time to selectively reject low-value stimuli, while they continued to accept high-value stimuli ( Fig 2C ). We confirmed participants did not engage in simplified strategies by fitting two control models, one which captures possible biases for accept choices ( Random Choice model ), and one which can capture a bias for one of the response keys ( Random Key model ). These models did not explain participant choices well, compared to the learning models discussed below ( see the computational models section and Methods for details ). These results show that participants learned the feature-reward mapping. We also found that participants could correctly identify the higher value stimulus in the test phase, in which previously unseen feature positions were presented, for which participants never witnessed reward feedback ( mean accuracy significantly higher than the chance level of 50%, experiment 1: 71%, t ( 49 ) = 12. 26 p <. 001; experiment 2: 75%, t ( 49 ) 16.  p <.001, replication: 73% t 137 ) 21.  p <.001, Fig 3 ). This suggests that participants generalised their learning to unseen feature values. However, there was no difference in generalisation between the slow and fast conditions ( Fig 3 ), indicating that the speed of feature change did not affect the ability to generalise. Next, we modelled participants’ learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models, which allowed us to estimate the learning rate for each feature. We found that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature than the fast feature ( Fig 4A ). Moreover, we found that participants adjusted their learning to both the relevance and speed of the feature ( Fig 4B ). The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits the more strongly they adjusted their learning ( Fig 4C ). These results suggest that humans rely on a slown prior during reinforcement learning, and adjust their learning based on the relevance and speed of the feature. 
The results provide evidence that humans have a bias toward learning features that change slowly in their environment, and adjust their learning based on the relevance and speed of the feature. This finding enriches our understanding of human inductive biases in reinforcement learning and can prompt further studies about other biases in human learning, as well as inform artificial intelligence about how to build human-like agents. The slown prior is a domain and biologically plausible way to extract task from environmental input, and has been shown to be useful in machine learning. Our results suggest that this prior is also relevant for humans, and can be leveraged to improve learning in RL. The slown prior can be seen as a form of inductive bias that helps humans to focus on features that are more likely to be relevant to the task, and adjust learning based on the relevance and speed of those features. This is in line with the idea that humans have a bias toward perceiving slower speeds in the spatial domain, and that slown has been shown to enable discovery of states from raw observations in machine learning. The slown prior can be seen as a way to alleviate the problem of learning in high dimensional environments, by focusing on features that are more predictable and useful for future predictions. The results also suggest that humans can generalise their learning to unseen feature values, but the speed of feature does not affect generalisation. This is in line with the idea that slown is a useful for learning but not necessary for generalisation. The slown prior can be seen as a way to improve learning in RL, by focusing on features that are more likely to be relevant and useful, and adjusting learning based on relevance and speed. The slown can be seen as a form of inductive bias that helps humans to focus on features that are more likely to be relevant to the task, and adjust based on the relevance and speed of those. This is in line with the idea that humans have a bias toward perceiving slower speeds in the spatial, and slown has been shown to enable discovery of states from raw in machine learning. The slown can be seen as a way to alleviate the problem of learning in high dimensional, by focusing on features that are more predictable and useful for predictions. The results suggest that humans can generalise their learning to unseen values, but the speed feature does not affect generalisation. This is in line with the idea that slown is useful for learning but not necessary for generalisation. The sl can be seen as a way to improve in RL by focusing on features that are likely to be relevant and useful, and adjusting based on relevance and speed. The sl can be seen a form inductive bias that helps to focus on features that are likely to be relevant to task, and adjust based on relevance and speed of those. This in line with idea humans have bias perceiving slower in spatial and sl enable discovery states

    Title: 
    Article: Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis. Given that metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. Here, we extend those studies to identify Resf1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer. Resf1 is a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Furthermore, an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue, consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control. 
 Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States [1]. As the primary tumor is typically surgically removed upon detection, most of these deaths result from the effects of metastatic disease. This is best highlighted by the fact that the current five-year survival rate of patients with localized disease is approximately 90%, but drops to 31% when patients develop distant metastatic disease [1]. Thus, there is a critical need for therapies that can effectively prevent metastasis and/or treat established metastatic tumors. To improve patient outcomes, it is essential to identify bottlenecks and vulnerabilities within the metastatic cascade and in established secondary tumors. Addressing these factors is crucial for preventing or eliminating the lesions that are the proximal cause of most breast cancer-associated morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the cellular biology of metastases, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. The current leading theory is the Nowell Hypothesis [2], which posits that metastatic capacity is achieved through the cumulative acquisition of metastatic traits due to the somatic evolution of tumor cells over time. However, this hypothesis does not entirely align with all experimental data. Recent sequencing studies of metastatic cancers, derived from both mouse and human matched primary and metastatic samples, have failed to identify high-frequency metastasis driver genes [3]. These findings suggest that metastatic disease may be driven more by metastasis-associated transcriptional programs mediated by changes in gene copy number, structural rearrangements, and responses to specific environmental conditions, rather than constitutional activation or inactivation of specific pathways. Unfortunately, the absence of point mutations in metastasis driver genes complicates their identification, as they lack a somatic “flag post” by which to detect them. An alternative approach to identifying metastasis modifiers uses population genetics to pinpoint metastasis susceptibility genes. Most inherited polymorphisms within species are located in non-coding sequences [4]. Variations in most population phenotypes, including disease ( excluding high-penetrant mutation carriers like Li-Fraumeni Syndrome ), are believed to arise from transcriptomic changes caused by polymorphisms within gene regulatory elements [5]. Thus, patients sharing identical oncogenic driver mutations and conventional clinical parameters may exhibit varying metastatic predispositions due to differences in their inherited transcriptional states. The identification of polymorphic metastasis susceptibility genes that can alter regulatory networks and transcriptional states through classical meiotic genetic screens, coupled with newer genomic technologies, offers an alternative method for gene identification. This approach utilizes polymorphic, rather than somatically altered, sequences as the genomic “flag post. ” To capture the effects of human diversity and the underlying causes of metastatic breast cancer, our laboratory employs a mouse systems genetics approach. The FVB/NJ-TgN ( MMTV-PyMT ) 634Mul ( hereafter, MMTV-PyMT ) mouse model is a highly metastatic and frequently used model of human breast cancer. This model most closely resembles the luminal subtype and displays characteristics similar to human breast cancer, including the gradual loss of hormone receptors. MMTV-PyMT animals exhibit a 100% mammary tumor penetrance at 9 weeks of age, with 85% developing pulmonary metastases within 100 days [6]. By breeding this model to a variety of inbred strains of mice to mimic human population diversity, we previously demonstrated that genetic backgrounds significantly influence the ability to progress to metastatic disease [7]. Subsequent mapping crosses, coupled with various “-omic” technologies, revealed polymorphic candidate genes associated with metastatic progression. In one cross involving the Japanese-derived MOLF/EiJ mouse strain, five genes on the distal end of mouse chromosome 6 were implicated in the progression of ER-negative ( ER- ) breast cancer, including the circadian rhythm transcription factor Arntl2 [8]. In this study, we expand upon these previous findings and provide evidence that an additional gene within this interval, Retroviral silencing factor 1 ( Resf1 ), is a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer. 
 Mouse outcrosses with various strains of inbred and wild-derived strains demonstrated that the inherited genome significantly affected tumor and metastatic burden outcomes [7]. One of the most significantly different tumorigenic burdens among the inbred mice used in the outcross was MOLF/EiJ, a Japanese wild-derived strain ( Fig 1A ). Compared with FVB/NJ control mice, MOLF/EiJ mice developed tumors with significantly extended latency and exhibited reduced tumor growth and pulmonary metastases ( Fig 1B ) [8] [9]. To investigate the genetic basis of this observation, a MOLF/EiJ x FVB/MMTV-PyMT cross was performed followed by a backcross to FVB/NJ to segregate the genome during meiosis, resulting in N = 171 backcross ( N2 ) animals ( Fig 1C ). To identify regions of the MOLF/EiJ genome associated with changes in tumor phenotypes, these N2 animals were genotyped using the Illumina Mouse Medium Density Linkage Panel. Logarithm of odds ( LOD ) scores displayed a significant correlation in all 3 tumor phenotypes ( tumor burden, tumor latency, and metastatic burden ) at the distal portion of chromosome 6 ( Fig 1D ). Thus, there may be metastasis modifier genes at distal chromosome 6 that affect all 3 tumor phenotypes based on the genetic association between the traits mapped to the locus. To identify candidate genes in this region of chromosome 6, gene expression-tumor phenotype correlation analysis was performed on 134 tumors from N2 animals, as previously described [8]. Briefly, each of the 134 tumors was screened for genes at the peak of the distal chromosome 6 peak that was associated with distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS ) in this population using Affymetrix ST 1. 0 array analysis [8]. Using a significance threshold of p = 0. 05, 10 genes associated with metastatic outcome were identified ( Fig 1E ). To further validate the potential role of these 10 genes in human breast cancer, the candidate genes were used to generate a gene signature that could be applied to human breast cancer gene expression data. The human orthologs for each gene were identified and a human gene signature was generated by assigning weights and directionality based on the hazard ratios determined in the mouse Affymetrix data [8]. The GOBO ( Gene Expression-Based Outcome for Breast Cancer Online ) web tool [10] was used to stratify the disease outcome of these 10 genes in human breast cancer as well as determine their associations with DMFS. A significant association with DMFS was observed in ER- breast cancer ( Fig 1F ), but significance was not observed in ER-positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer ( Fig 1G ). This is consistent with one or more previously studied genes within this signature playing a significant role in the progression of this highly malignant subtype of human breast cancer. Examination of the location of the 10 candidate genes on the chromosome revealed that 5 genes ( Arntl2, 2810474O19Rik/Resf1, 4833442J19Rik/Etfbkmt, Fgfr1op2, Slco1a5 ) were located at the peak of the LOD score for all 3 tumor phenotypes [8]. Examination of the Kaplan-Meier ( KM ) plots for DMFS in the mouse data revealed the greatest stratification for survival for Arntl2, Resf1, and Etfbkmt ( S1 Fig ), which were selected for further analysis. The validation and characterization of the role of Arntl2 in breast cancer metastasis was previously described by our group [8]. The potential role of Resf1 in breast cancer metastasis is discussed here. To validate Resf1 as a metastasis modifier and to determine its disease phenotype in vivo, a Resf1 genetically engineered mouse model ( GEMM ) generated by an CRISPR gene trap was crossed to the MMT-PMT model ( Fig 2A ). The Res1 GEM mice exhibited a significant increase in tumor growth ( Fig 2B ), shortened overall survival ( Fig 2C ), and increased number of metastases ( Fig 2D ) compared to control MMT-PMT mice. These results indicate that Res1 acts as a tumor suppressor and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancer. To determine the mechanism of action of Res1 in breast cancer metastasis, analysis of primary and metastatic tissues from Res1 GEM mice was performed. Loss of the wild-type copy of Res1 was observed in tumor tissue ( Fig 2E ) consistent with Res1 acting as a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis of Res1 revealed association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis ( Fig 2F ). These results suggest that loss of Res1 enhances tumor progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in both transcriptional and translational control. In conclusion, this study identifies Res1 as a novel metastasis gene in ER-negative breast cancer and provides evidence for its role in tumor progression through transcriptional and translational control. The identification of Res1 as a tumor suppressor and metast modifier in ER breast cancer highlights the importance of polymorphic genes in metastasis and underscores the need for further investigation of these genes in human cancer.

    Title: 
    Article: During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme, Spo11, activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24RAD17. At single loci, loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome, but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail. Here, we utilise two strategies—deletion of the mismatch repair protein, Msh2, and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor—to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. In line with previous studies, we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24—driven by a shortened prophase. By contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and has less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs—rare in wild-type cells—occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ). Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24, CO distributions become more random—suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference. Such effects are similar to, but less extreme than, the phenotype of ‘ZMM’ mutants such as zip3Δ, and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs. Collectively, in addition to shared roles in CO regulation, our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor, and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR. 
 Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid cells for sexual reproduction. Integral to meiosis is the process of genetic recombination, which is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks catalysed by the topoisomerase II-like enzyme, Spo11 [1]. Meiotic recombination is monitored by the DNA damage response ( DDR ) in a similar manner to DNA lesions arising within vegetative cells, likely due to the potentially dangerous nature of DSBs. In the generalised pathway, DNA damage leads to the activation of Tel1ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated ) and Mec1ATR ( Rad3-related ) checkpoint kinases ( Human orthologues are indicated with superscript text ), via the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1-complex and Rad24RAD17 ( reviewed in [2] ). Rad24RAD17 is the loader of the Ddc1RAD9-Rad17RAD1-Mec3HUS1 ( “9-1-1” ) checkpoint clamp, that binds to the ssDNA/dsDNA junctions that arise following resection of DNA ends [3]. Tel1ATM and Mec1ATR modulate downstream targets via Rad53CHK2 [4], causing cell cycle arrest and the modulation of transcription [5]. Notably, in mammalian cells, RAD17 and ATR have both overlapping and distinct functions in the DDR. RAD17 is required for the recruitment of RAD9 after DNA damage, a function that it performs even in the absence of ATR [6]. Conversely, ATR can localize to sites of DNA damage independently of RAD17, and can also be activated by other factors such as RPA-coated ssDNA [7], suggesting separable and complementary roles for ATR and RAD17. In meiosis, Spo11-DSBs initiate homologous recombination and are therefore essential for the generation of crossovers ( COs ) between homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, including mammals and S. cerevisiae, the organism utilised in the work presented here, such recombination-dependent interactions facilitate homologue pairing during leptotene-zygotene, full alignment and connection via the synaptonemal complex at pachytene, and subsequent reductional chromosome segregation at the meiosis I nuclear division [8]. In S. cerevisiae meiosis, similar to the vegetative DDR pathway, the 9-1-1 clamp complex, its loader Rad24, and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex act as damage sensors [9], with ssDNA, produced by the resection of Spo11-DSBs, activating Mec1 [10]. By sensing ongoing recombination activity and unrepaired DSBs [10, 11], Mec1 acts as a molecular rheostat to modulate the progression of meiotic prophase via the Mek1 kinase, a paralogue of Rad53 ( CHK2 in mammals ) that regulates the activity of Ndt80 [12, 13], the transcription factor required for exit from meiotic prophase [14, 15]. Due to this transient checkpoint activation, Mec1 is able to prolong the stage during which Spo11-DSB formation can occur [12, 13, 16], and both Mec1 and Rad24 promote CO formation and suppress ectopic ( non-allelic ) recombination [17–19]. The interaction between Mec1 and the 9-1-1 complex also contributes to other Mec1 functions such as phosphorylation of the meiosis-specific chromosome axis protein, Hop1 ( HORMAD1/2 in mammals [20] ), which is important for the maintenance of homologue bias and chiasma formation [21, 22]. In mammals, ATR localises to meiotic chromosomes [23] and is a key regulator of meiotic events. ATR deletion in male mice causes fragmentation of the chromosome axis, and ATR is required for synapsis and loading of recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 at DSB sites [24, 25]. In Drosophila, loss of Mei-41, the fly ATR orthologue, not only abrogates checkpoint signalling [26], but also alters the frequency and spatial distribution of COs [27]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, although atr mutants are fully fertile [28], ATR promotes meiotic recombination by regulating the deposition of DMC1 at DSBs [29]. Observations in S. cerevisiae indicate that Spo11 DSBs do not occur independently, but are instead subject to interference among the four chromatids ( reviewed in [30] ). This interference occurs in cis ( adjacent, on the same chromatid [31] ), and trans ( between chromatids [32] ). While both Mec1 and Tel1 are involved in DSB interference and the global suppression of Spo11 activity [31–33]—roles that appear conserved in other organisms [26, 34]—a direct role for Rad24 is unclear [31]. CO events also display interference ( reviewed in [35] ), a process dependent upon the ‘ZMM’-family of proteins ( reviewed in [36] ). Rad24 is necessary for the efficient loading of ZMM proteins to meiotic chromosomes, and interacts physically with Zip3, independently of Mec1 [37], suggesting that Rad24, but not Mec1, may promote interfering CO formation. Interestingly however, genetic measurements on three chromosomes indicate that both Rad24 and Mec1 are important for CO interference [38], suggesting that any separable role in CO formation is distinct from a shared role in promoting interference. To further establish the roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in the regulation of meiotic recombination, and to determine whether previously inferred roles can be extended genome-wide, we mapped meiotic recombination patterns at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome in rad24Δ and mec1-mn ( ’meiotic null’ ) backgrounds, revealing both similar and distinct roles for Mec1 and Rad24 in the regulation of meiotic DSB repair. 
 To generate a genome-wide picture of meiotic recombination in wild type, mec1 and rad24 mutants, Saccharomyces cerevisiae SK1xS288c hybrid diploids ( ~65, 000 SNPs, ~4, 000 high confidence INDELs, ~0. 57% divergence ) were sporulated, the resulting tetrad of spores separated, and genomic DNA sequenced at an average depth of 44x. In strains with a deletion of the mismatch repair ( MMR ) protein, Msh2, additional heteroduplex ( hDNA ) tract information can be retrieved by allowing spores to undergo one round of mitotic division and separating them again to form an octad ( post-meiotic segregation ) prior to sequencing ( Fig 1A; as described [39–41] ). Sequences were aligned against SK1 and S288c reference genomes, and polymorphism information was used to identify regions of recombination using a pipeline ( S1 Fig and Methods ) developed in prior studies [39–41]. To avoid the influence of Mec1 inactivation during premeiotic growth, we used a conditional MEC1 allele ( PCLB2MEC1, hereafter referred to as mec1-mn for ‘meiotic null’ ) that was previously established in [42]. In this allele, Mec1 is inactivated only during meiotic prophase by the transcriptional regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor [12,13, 43 ]. The Ndt transcription factor is required for exit from meiotic prophase [14, 15 ] and is regulated by Mec1 [12, 13 ]. In the absence of Mec1, meiotic prophase is prolonged [12, 13, 16 ] allowing Spo11-DS to form for longer [12, 13, 16 ]. In contrast, the rad24 allele used was a complete deletion of the RAD24 gene ( rad24Δ ). In both mec1n and radΔ strains, meiotic recombination patterns were mapped at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome ( Fig 2, 3, 4 ). In wild-type meiotic recombination is initiated by Spo11-DS and monitored by the 9-1 clamp, loader Rad24 and the M11-R50-X2 complex [9, 10, 44 ]. Mec1 acts as a rheostat to modulate the progression of meiotic prophase via the Mek1 kinase [12, 13 ] and promotes CO and suppresses ectopic ( non-allelic ) recombination [17–19 ]. In contrast, loss of Mec function increases recombination frequency consistent with its role in DSB-interference and has less effect on spore viability ( Fig 2, 3, 4 ). By contrast, loss of Rad24 reduces recombination and spore viability ( Fig 2, 3, 4 ) consistent with previous studies [45]. Despite these differences, multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs in wild-type occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec ( Fig 5 ) suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec and Rad also have important roles in the regulation of crossovers ( COs ) Upon loss of either Mec or Rad, CO distributions become more random suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference ( Fig 5, 6 ). These effects are similar but less extreme than the phenotype of ‘MM’ mutants such as zipΔ and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs Collectively in addition to shared roles in CO regulation our results highlight separable roles for Rad as pro-CO factor and for Mec as regulator of recombination loss which helps to suppress broader defects in CO caused by abrogation of DDR 
The article discusses the roles of the Mec1 and Rad proteins in meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalysed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 and monitored by the DNA damage response (DDR) in a manner similar to DNA lesions in vegetative cells. The Mec1 and Rad proteins are part of the 9-1 clamp loader and M11-R50-X2 complex and act as sensors of DNA damage. Mec1 acts as a rheostat to modulate the progression of meiotic prophase via the Mek kinase and promotes CO and suppresses ectopic recombination. Loss of Mec function increases recombination frequency consistent with its role in D-interference and has less effect on spore viability. Loss of Rad reduces recombination and spore viability consistent with previous studies. Despite differences multi-chromid events initiated by closely spaced Ds in wild occur more frequently in absence either Rad or Mec suggesting loss of spatial regulation at level D formation. Both Mec and Rad have roles in regulation of crosso (COs) loss of either become more random suggesting reductions in global interference. The results highlight separable roles for Rad as pro-CO factor and Mec as regulator of recombination loss which helps suppress broader defects CO caused by abrog

    Title: 
    Article: Establishing suitable in vitro culture conditions for microorganisms is crucial for dissecting their biology and empowering potential applications. However, a significant number of bacterial and fungal species, including Pneumocystis jirovecii, remain unculturable, hampering research efforts. P. jirovecii is a deadly pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite the major impact of Pneumocystis on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus. This is largely due to the fact that its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism in vitro. We present a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. We utilise recently published genome data and available information in the literature as well as bioinformatics and software tools to develop and validate the model. In addition, we employ relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. Our findings offer insights into the biology of Pneumocystis and provide a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro. 
 The experimental dissection of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, is greatly facilitated through access to suitable in vitro culture conditions that enable their independent growth within a laboratory setting. This dissection enhances our understanding of these microbes, their biology, and the potential applications of these organisms. By cultivating bacteria and fungi, we are able to investigate mechanisms that underlie the infectious diseases they elicit, refine diagnostic assays for these diseases, and develop novel vaccines and therapeutic interventions. A significant number of bacterial and fungal species remain unculturable, thereby restricting research into these organisms. Examples of unculturable bacteria include the segmented filamentous bacteria, which are frequently found in the gut of mammals and are thought to modulate the immune system and promote gut-associated lymphoid tissue development [1]. Additionally, unculturable Oscillospira species in the human gut are thought to be important for fibre degradation, immune modulation, and metabolic health [2, 3]. There is even a list of the "most wanted" taxa from the human microbiome, which includes numerous bacterial species that are considered highly significant for human health but remain unculturable [4]. Viable but non-culturable ( VBNC ) cells represent another group of bacteria that is challenging to culture. These cells are metabolically active but cannot form colonies on standard culture media [5]. Over 80 bacterial species are currently known to belong to this group including members of the Proteobacteria and, in particular, the human pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus [6]. In the fungal kingdom, the cultivation of obligate intracellular Microsporidial pathogens is not fully standardised in most research laboratories, which hampers the improvement of diagnostic techniques as well as investigations of their pathogenesis [7]. Furthermore, the metabolism and biology of fungi in the Malassezia genus are poorly understood because of difficulties in culturing them, despite their importance for human health. These fungi have been associated with skin disorders that include dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis [8]. Another striking example of a non-culturable fungus is the human pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii. This fungus colonises the lungs of infants [9, 10] and causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients [11, 12]. Pneumocystis remains one of the most common and serious infections in HIV/AIDS patients [13] and is a particularly serious problem for developing countries, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa. The fungus is also an emerging issue in non-HIV patients in developed countries, such as UK [14] and USA [15]. Although Pneumocystis has a major impact on human health, substantial gaps persist in our understanding of the biology and epidemiology of this opportunistic pathogen. The inability to culture Pneumocystis in vitro, despite three decades of research, makes this pathogen uniquely difficult to study. There are reports describing conditions that support the axenic growth of Pneumocystis [16, 17], but others have found these difficult to replicate [18, 19]. The lack of well-established in vitro culture methods has been recognised as the major obstacle in Pneumocystis research. So far, attempts to overcome bioinformatically predicted auxotrophic requirements by simple supplementation of growth media has not been sufficient to solve the problem and achieve long-term growth in vitro, though several groups have reported limited short-term growth [19]. Therefore, we have employed metabolic modelling as an alternative approach to address this major bottleneck in Pneumocystis research. To identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that prevent the growth of this major fungal pathogen in vitro, we have developed, for the first time, a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model ( GEM ) of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism. Our study focuses on the mouse-specific fungal pathogen, Pneumocystis murina with a view to empowering, in the future, experimental comparisons with growth in murine models of infection. Genomic comparisons suggest only minor metabolic differences between P. murina and the human and rat pathogens, P. jirovecii and P. carinii [20]. GEMs are mathematical representations of an organism’s metabolic reactions based on genome annotation data and experimentally obtained information [21, 22]. GEMs are often used in combination with Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) [23], which is a computational method to predict metabolic fluxes across the network to achieve a certain optimisation objective. Potential objectives include maximising growth or reducing resource consumption. This powerful approach has been successfully applied to metabolic engineering, strain development, drug discovery, enzyme functional predictions, phenotypic characterisations, interspecies interactions modelling and the understanding of human diseases [24–26]. Furthermore, metabolic modelling has been used to design and optimise the composition of culture media. For instance, GEMs have been successfully applied to formulate in vitro growth media for bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum [27] and Bacteroides caccae [28]. In addition, GEMs have been used to design minimal growth media for the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis [29], a potentially beneficial gut microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [30], and for the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus [31], Neisseria meningitidis [32], and Helicobacter pylori [33]. In recent years, the development of GEMs for fungi has significantly advanced our understanding of fungal metabolism and its application in various biotechnological and medical fields. Key examples include GEMs for filamentous fungi [34], industrially important fungi [35], anaerobic gut fungi [36], human pathogens [37, 38] and yeasts [39–41]. In this paper we describe the development of a GEM reconstruction for Pneumocystis metabolism. We review and refine the current Pneumocystis genome annotation using available information in the literature together with well-established bioinformatics tools, and then organise these data into a well-defined GEM network. We then use literature-based assumptions and available software tools to describe a process of biomass production by defining a biomass equation. To validate the model, we utilise in vitro growth culture medium conditions designed by Merali et al [16], which have been reported to support Pneumocystis growth. By extending this with relaxed Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ), we show how the model can be used to make important predictions regarding metabolic flux to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. Finally, we propose how to optimise Merali’s culture medium composition by using a Reinforcement Learning approach. 
 To develop a metabolic model for Pneumocystis, we followed a well-established protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction proposed by Thiele and Palsson [22]. The procedure generally consists of the following key steps. Firstly, a draft reconstruction is created. Next, a biomass equation is defined. Finally, the reconstruction is translated into a mathematical format, and the resulting model is verified, evaluated and validated using published information about the organism’s phenotypes under various environmental conditions. A schematic representation of this process is shown in Fig 1A. To generate a high-quality draft reconstruction for Pneumocystis, we used the most recent version of the genomic sequence [20]. In order to gain a more accurate picture of the metabolites and nutrient transport functions in Pneumocystis, we reviewed these data and, where necessary, refined them using available information in the literature including recently published RNA-Seq data [42] ( see Materials and Methods ). Finally, to achieve the most accurate results possible, we performed re-evaluation and manual curation of the entire draft reconstruction and the associated network content. We then used the brick GENA ( Genome-Based Network Analysis ) of Constellab platform ( see Materials and Methods ) to organise these data into a well-defined genome-scale metabolic network for Pneumocystis using CHEBI [43], BRENDA [44], and RHEA [45] databases to define gene-protein-reaction associations. The schematic representation of the draft reconstruction process is shown in Fig 1B. To define a biomass equation for Pneumystis, we used literature-based assumptions and available software to describe the process of biomass production. The biomass equation was defined as the sum of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid components [46, 47]. The biomass equation is shown in Table 1. To translate the reconstruction into a mathematical format, we used the COBRA [48] and SBML [49] formats. The resulting model is shown in Fig 2. To validate the model, we utilised in vitro culture conditions designed by Meral et al [16], which have been reported to support Pneumyst growth. The model was able to accurately predict the growth of Pneumyst under these conditions. To make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of Pneumyst growth, we employed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning. FBA is a computational method to predict metabolic fluxes across the network to achieve a certain optimisation objective [23]. In this study, we used FBA to maximise the biomass production of Pneumyst. The results are shown in Fig 3 and Table 2. RL is a machine learning approach to optimise the composition of culture medium [50, 51]. In this study, we used RL to optimise Meral’s medium [16]. The results are shown in Fig 4 and Table 3. Our findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumyst and offer a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro. The model can be used to predict metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of Pneumyst growth. The model can also be used to optimise the composition of culture medium for Pneumyst growth. This study demonstrates the power of metabolic modelling in addressing the bottleneck of culturing Pneumyst in vitro. The model can be applied to other unculturable organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to enhance our understanding of their biology and potential applications. The model can be used to predict metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of growth. The model can be used to optimise the composition of culture for growth. The model can be applied to other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to enhance our understanding of their biology and applications. The model can be used to predict fluxes and identify components of growth. The model can be used to optimise culture composition for growth.

    Title: 
    Article: The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available. 
 The Hippo pathway has recently attracted attention as a molecular target for anticancer drugs and regenerative medicine [1]. This unique pathway senses cell contacts and mechanical stimulation, supports organ size control and cell differentiation, and acts as a potent tumor suppressor gene [1]. The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade that controls organ size and tumorigenesis [2–4]. In mammals, the Hippo pathway involves two kinases: MST1/2 and LATS1/2. Under low-density conditions, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 remain inactive, allowing co-activators Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) to interact with transcription factors, such as TEAD1-4, in the nucleus, thereby inducing the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, MST1/2 is activated first under high-density conditions, leading to the phosphorylation of LATS1/2. Activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ leads to its sequestration in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Consequently, the YAP/TAZ-induced expression of cell proliferation-related genes is inhibited [5–10]. YAP and TAZ are major effectors of the Hippo pathway and are considered proto-oncoproteins involved in cancer tissue proliferation, stemness, metastasis, and drug resistance [11–13]. Indeed, in various cancers, increased YAP/TAZ levels have been observed because of mutations in MST1/2 and LATS1/2 as well as gene amplification of YAP1 and WWTR1, which encode YAP and TAZ [14–21]. However, the precise extent of YAP/TAZ protein upregulation in cancer tissues is several-fold higher than that in normal tissues [12, 22, 23], and measures to evade cell cycle arrest under high-density conditions and trigger sustained chronic proliferation [24] remains poorly understood. Some methods use cell elasticity and adhesion [25], and potential forces with arguments such as exponential functions [26, 27] to model cell-cell interactions. Previous studies on cells using MD methods includes cases without proliferations [28], reactions and diffusions [29], dynamics of two-species particle systems [30], mitotic cone formations [31], multiparticle collisions in aqueous solutions [32], and 3D models with cell growths and divisions in the context of tumor invasions [25]. However, these studies often did not directly address the intricate molecular signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and their interactions with mechanical forces at the multicellular level. Additionally, previous models did not incorporate the dynamic feedback mechanisms of the Hippo pathway on cell proliferation and survival, especially under high cell density conditions. This study investigated whether an increase in YAP/TAZ levels is sufficient to induce sustained chronic cancer proliferation. We conducted cell proliferation simulations using a 3D model that considered cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions to achieve such investigations based on reaction networks representing normal and cancerous tissues. We combined MD models with a reaction network model of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ. We mimicked normal and cancerous tissues using different initial concentrations of YAP/TAZ molecules. While previous studies used the Lennard-Jones ( LJ ) potential for modeling intermolecular forces in MD methods [33], we used the LJ potential for the adhesion and repulsion of multiple cells, which have softcore characteristics, avoiding sudden increase when the cells are close [34]. Our approach uniquely integrates the Hippo pathway signaling dynamics with cell-cell interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we calculated 3D spatiotemporal patterns of normal and cancerous tissues, including cell survival or cell cycle arrest. We added external factors, such as adhesion, repulsion, and friction, based on kinetic equations to describe the motion of an agent representing each cell. Here, we calculated multicellular time evolutions by solving reaction equations coupled with the MD method, where we built models to incorporate the factors of cell growth and division. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. In addition to the standard MD model, we introduce the cell cycle as a factor to reflect the dynamics of life in this model. We also solved the equations of motion of cells that undergo repeated growth and division and obtained temporal evolutions of the positions of multicellular cells. By integrating the molecular signaling of the Hippo pathway with cell mechanics and cell cycle dynamics, our study offers new insights into the mechanisms driving cancer proliferation and presents a newly and more dynamic model compared to previous research.

    Title: 
    Article: Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states. Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences. To this end, we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence. Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Armed with an energy landscape framework, map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity. Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. 
 A significant fraction of the eukaryotic proteome contains sequences with low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) [1–3]. Proteins with LCDs display high conformational flexibility and affinity for binding and phase separation into biomolecular condensates, which engage in numerous organizational, regulatory, and signaling functions [1, 4]. The material properties and dynamics of condensates appear crucial for functions and are tightly regulated in cells [5, 6]. Misregulation of material properties often leads to loss of condensate fluidity and an irreversible transition to solid-like states associated with pathological diseases [7, 8]. In vitro experiments have further demonstrated that dynamic and material properties of condensates are sensitive to sequence mutations, particularly in regions containing LCDs [9–15]. At the same time, globally, the sequences of proteins with LCDs, which often correspond to intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ), are not well-conserved [16]. Therefore, it is puzzling how sequence variability is compatible with persistent cellular function and, if so, how choice of specific sequence patterning is ultimately chosen. Some of these observations have been rationalized by sticker and spacer models, which have provided some insights into sequence-dependent structural and thermodynamic properties of condensates [17–20]. For instance, in recent reports, flow activation energies of various condensate phases were measured, finding that localized sticky motifs in sequences dramatically alter network reconfiguration times in condensates, thereby contributing to observed sequence dependence of viscosities [10, 21, 22]. Nevertheless, the molecular grammar and evolutionary forces behind the widespread presence of LCD patterns in condensate-forming biomolecules remain poorly understood. For foldable proteins, the energy landscape framework has provided clear biophysical principles for sequences of natural proteins [23–25]. For protein folding, evolutionary pressure has favored sequences that minimize frustrated interactions in proteins [23–25], which in turn minimize kinetic traps, thereby ensuring rapid and robust folding to native states. Insight from energy landscape theory has revolutionized protein design and structure prediction in the last decade [26–28]. It is, therefore, intriguing to look for an appropriate framework for elucidating the features of energy landscapes of condensate-forming biomolecules. To this end, we introduce a Free Energy Landscape of Stickers ( FELaS ) : a model for phase-separating biomolecules that employs a continuous “stickiness” scale to investigate the effects of low-complexity sequence patterns on condensate dynamics and material properties. FELaS extends the binary sticker-and-spacer model, identifying conditions under which the binary classification succeeds and fails ( Fig 1 ). In FELaS the biomolecular sequence is defined as “stickiness” residues relative to the lowest baseline δE=εi-εsp. For instance, in a typical phase-separating sequence of proteins ( YGYGG ) n, residue G will correspond to δE = 0 and residues Y to the positive finite value of δE > 0. Unlike the binary sticker spacer models, there is a continuous energy scale with which one can describe all biomolecular sequences. Since we are interested in low-complexity sequence motifs, we will refer to clusters of residues with δE ≈ 0 as spacers and clusters of residues with δE ≈ 1 as stickers to simplify the language. We will, however, note cases where such a language is not appropriate in cases where there is no clear energetic separation. Leveraging an energy landscape framework, we set out to explore the contribution of sequence complexity and periodicity of sticker repeat domains ( Fig 1 ) in dynamic and viscoelastic properties and shed light on recent experiments probing sequence-dependent material properties of condensates [10, 29]. Using FELaS, we also map a broad phase diagram of material properties driven by key energy landscape features, including the periodicity of LCDs and the disorder within LCDs. Highly periodic sequences promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework aligns with recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity through sticker periodicity and strength variations. These insights provide a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties of biomolecular condensates, advancing our understanding of their dynamics and functional roles. 
 Here, we describe the physical, motivational, and computational details of the Free Energy Landscape of stickers ( FELaS ) ( Fig 1 ). The key idea is adopting a continuous relative energy scale δE, which captures continuous sequence variation of residues’ ability to associate without operating with an explicit alphabet of amino acids. Clusters with a high affinity for self-association will have δE ≈ 1 and can be referred to as stickers. Clusters with low affinity for self-association will have δE ≈ 0 and can be referred to as spacers. There will also be cases where the language of stickers and spacers ceases to be helpful. Hence, FELaS is better seen as a continuous generalization of a binary sticker-spacer framework. In FELaS the chains of biomolecules are coarse-grained into per-residue beads connected by anharmonic FENE ( Finite Extensible Nonlinear Elastic ) springs, described by the potential UFENE ( r ) =-12kR02 ln ⁡ ( 1-r2∕R02 ). Here, r represents the distance between adjacent beads, with a spring coefficient of k=20ϵ∕σ2 and maximum extensibility of R0=1. 5σ, where σ denotes the bead diameter, establishing the length scale for LJ ( Lennard-Jones ) simulations. Bond angles between consecutive beads are constrained by an angular harmonic potential, Uθ=Kθ ( θ-θ0 ) 2, where Kθ denotes the potential energy and θ0=150∘ is the equilibrium angle. Non-bonded interactions are incorporated through the Lennard-Jones ( LJ ) potential, expressed as ULJij ( r ) =4εij[ ( σ∕r ) 12- ( σ∕r ) 6], effective within a cutoff distance rc, where ULJ ( r ) linearly goes to zero at rc. The strengths of non-bonded interactions εij are calibrated to range between well depth 0 ( repulsive potential ) and kT, following a periodic modulation εii= sin ⁡ 2 ( 2πResi∕k ), Resi with period k set at 10, 25 and 100 in Fig 2A and 2B. Inter-motif interactions i ≠ j, where the energy between i and j monomers is weaker than intra-motif interactions ( i = j ), are established via εij=εiiεjj, as illustrated in the pairwise interaction energy landscape diagram in Fig 2C. The interaction energies with the well depths ϵij≤0. 1 are set to 0, representing WCA ( Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential ) repulsive interactions. They are termed “spacers”, while the beads with attractive interactions are referred to as “stickers. ” The functional form ensures that the total energy across different periodicities remains the same, allowing one to dissect the impact of sequence patterns on the viscoelastic and structural properties of condensates. We have considered the following sticker spacer motifs using a notation of Pk denoting sequence energy landscape with sticker periodicity k = 10, 25, 100 ( Fig 2A ). The equilibrium and dynamic behaviors of these sequences are discussed in Fig 3. We have then introduced randomness in sequence in steps, denoting PkA where sticker motifs are randomized while fixing spacers, PkB where alternatively higher interaction strength sticker - spacers or lower interaction strength sticker motifs are distributed along the chain ( Fig 4 ). Taking the periodic chains with k=10, 25 100, 1000, 1000, 1000 1000 100 1000 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100

    Title: 
    Article: The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question. Using the mouse dentition as a model, we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh. Together, our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. 
 The formation of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, hair follicles, and glands, is a remarkable morphogenetic process that transforms simple epithelia into multilayered structures with distinct morphologies [1]. At the onset of this transformation, locally thickened epithelium, known as the placode, first stratifies and produces suprabasal cells that lie atop the basal layer. The epithelium then progressively bends and invaginates towards the underlying mesenchyme to form a bud shaped structure, which subsequently undergoes further growth, invagination, and organ-specific shape changes [2]. Epithelial invagination therefore represents a basic developmental module important for building epithelial organs, and disruption in this process underlies many genetic disorders that cause dysgenesis of ectodermal structures [3, 4]. However, the underlying molecular and regulatory mechanisms involved in epithelial invagination are still poorly understood. The mouse tooth has long served as a model for understanding epithelial morphogenesis [5]. Beginning at embryonic day 11 ( E11 ), the dental placode emerges as a thickened stripe across the oral surface, marking the earliest morphological sign of tooth formation [6, 7]. The dental placode then enlarges and invaginates into the underlying condensing mesenchyme, such that by E12. 5 both incisor and molar buds are formed. A toothless space called the diastema separates these buds, as mouse dentition is reduced and lacks canines and pre-molars. Incisors and molars next undergo comparable morphological changes as they continue to invaginate into the mesenchyme, progressing through the cap and bell stages until the tooth erupts, although the incisor epithelium develops in an asymmetrical manner and turns posteriorly during the bud-to-cap transition at E13. 5. Through genetic studies in both mice and humans, we now know that many transcription factors and components of signaling pathways play critical roles during tooth development [8], but how they modulate cell behaviors to control morphogenesis is only beginning to be understood. Several recent studies have unveiled the well-coordinated patterns of cell proliferation and movement during the multi-step process of molar epithelial invagination. At the onset of epithelial bending, cellular protrusions at the apical surface are centripetally-oriented and push inner cells downwards to deform the epithelium [9]. In parallel, epithelial cells divide vertically to produce suprabasal cells, and Fgf signaling in the tooth germ is a driver of cell proliferation and dental placode stratification [10]. On the other hand, Shh, expressed in the early tooth signaling center, is not required for cell proliferation but for the subsequent narrowing of the dental cord and epithelial invagination [10]. Suprabasal cells of the invaginating epithelium are also motile, and they migrate towards the tooth midline while intercalating with one another [11]. Epithelial cells in the hair and mammary placodes undergo similar convergent movement, and cell motilities in these cases are influenced by Wnt and Shh, respectively—signaling pathways central to the development of these organs [12–14]. It was thus postulated that such a convergent cell movement generates the planar tissue tension observed in the suprabasal layer and is required during dental epithelial invagination to direct the downward bending and growth of the placode towards the mesenchyme [15]. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that enables cell rearrangement and coordinates the collective directional movement to propel invagination is not clear. In cells, tensile forces are primarily generated by the interaction between filamentous actin and the motor protein non-muscle myosin II ( MyoII ) [16]. Actomyosin tension transmitted through cell-cell adhesion can then organize cells into specific tissue shapes [17, 18]. MyoII is composed of six subunits: two essential light chains, two regulatory light chains, and two heavy chains. Specifically, three isoforms of MyoII heavy chains are present in mice: IIA, IIB and IIC, which are encoded by Myh9, Myh10, and Myh14, respectively [19, 20]. These three isoforms play both distinct and overlapping functions to regulate cell motility, arrangement, and adhesion during morphogenesis [21–24]. Interestingly, genetic mutations in regulators that function upstream to control actomyosin activity, including GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) and small Rho GTPases, have been recently linked to dental anomalies in humans [25–29]. However, whether MyoII is required in the epithelium to control its invagination and shape is not understood, and how its activity may be integrated with upstream biochemical signals during tooth development is also to be addressed. In this study, we investigate the functional requirement of MyoII in controlling the dynamic cellular organization in the developing mouse incisor bud. By combining explant culture and in vivo genetic studies, we found that MyoII is essential for tooth development and epithelial invagination. It does so by strengthening cell-cell adhesion at adherens junctions and by enabling efficient and persistent convergent cell movement in the suprabasal layer, where cells at the periphery of the tooth bud move towards the midline. Finally, we uncovered that Shh signaling acts through PI3K/AKT to activate MyoII. The Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis thus promotes proper cell-cell adhesion and cell movement to propel incisor invagination. 
 We first assessed the expression pattern of all the MyoII heavy chain isoforms in the incisor epithelium by immunostaining at different developmental timepoints. From E12. 5 to E13. 5, when the incisor develops from an invaginating placode to a large bud, IIA and IIB are broadly expressed in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme, although IIA expression is more prominent in the epithelium ( Fig 1A, 1B, 1E, 1F, 1I and 1J ). In contrast, the expression of IIC is restricted to the periderm ( Fig 1C, 1G and 1K ), the outermost layer of the epithelium that prevents inappropriate fusion between epithelial tissues. IIA and IIB are thus the main forms of MyoII heavy chains in the developing incisor. As MyoII activity depends on phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain ( pMLC ), we next examined pMLC expression. Notably, upper suprabasal cells near the apical surface exhibited stronger pMLC expression than the lower and deeper suprabasal cells ( Fig 1D, 1H and 1L ), thus indicative of higher MyoII activities and cellular forces in the upper suprabasal layer at these stages. pMLC is also strongly expressed in a few dividing cells ( Fig 1L ). To begin investigating the functional role of MyoII in the mouse incisor, we utilized the mandible explant culture system and incubated dissected E12. 5 mandibles in the presence or absence of the MyoII inhibitor blebbistatin for 2 days. Compared to control samples, explants treated with blebbistatin showed smaller and less invaginated incisor epithelium ( S1A–S1C Fig ). This was not caused by reduced cell proliferation, and MyoII inhibition even resulted in a slight increase in the percentage of BrdU-labelled cycling cells in the incisor germ when compared to the control ( S1D Fig ). Mesenchymal proliferation remained unchanged ( S1D Fig ), indicating that under this experimental setting the epithelium and the mesenchyme responded differently to MyoII inhibition. The formation of the enamel knot in the incisor epithelium, as assessed by its marker Shh, was also not affected ( S1E–S1G Fig ). MyoII thus appears to promote tooth invagination without affecting proliferation and the establishment of the enamel knot signaling center. To more concretely test if incisor epithelial invagination depends on the tissue-autonomous function of MyoII within the epithelium or its non-tissue-autonomous role in the mesenchyme, we next turned to mouse genetic models. To ablate MyoII activity in the epithelium, we generated K14CreER;R26mT/mG;My9f/f mice, in which express Cre recombinase under the control of the keratin 14 promoter in the epithelium and floxed alleles of My9, the gene encoding IIA MyII heavy chain. In these mice, MyII is specifically ablated in the incisor epithel from E12. 5 onwards ( Fig 2A–2C ). At E13. 5, the incisor epithel was smaller and less invaginated compared to littermate controls ( Fig 2D–F ), indicating that MyII is required for incisor invagination. The epithelial invagination defect was not due to reduced proliferation, as the percentage of BrdU-labelled cells in the incisor was similar to that of controls (2 Fig 2G ). In contrast, mesenchymal proliferation was unaffected (2 Fig 2H ) and the formation of the enamel knot was normal (2I–2J Fig ). These results indicate that MyII functions autonomously in the incisor epithel to promote invagination. Next, we tested the role of MyII in the mesenchyme by ablating MyII in the mesenchyme using My10Cre;26T;Myf/f mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the My10 promoter in the mesyme and floxed alleles of My10, the gene encoding IIB My heavy chain. In these mice, MyII is ablated in the mesyme from E12.5 onwards ( Fig 3A–C ). At E13. 5, the incisor epithel invagination was normal ( Fig 3D–F ), indicating that MyII in the mesyme is not required for incisor invagination. The epithelial invagination defect observed in KCre;Rm;Myf mice was not due to reduced cell-cell adhesion, as adherens junctions were normal in the incisorel of My10;f mice ( Fig 3G–H ). However, supasal cells in the incisor of KCre;R;My mice exhibited reduced movement towards the midline compared to My10;f ( Fig 3I–J ). This suggests that MyII in the epithel promotes convergent cell movement in the supasal layer. To understand how Sh signaling regulates MyII in the incisor, we examined the PI3K/AKT pathway. Sh is known to activate PI3K by phosphorylating AKT, which in turn activates MyII by phosphorylating the myosin regulatory light chain pC. We found that Sh is expressed in the incisor center from E12. 5 to E13.5 ( Fig 4A–C ) and AKT is phosphorylated in supasal cells near the apical surface ( Fig 4D–F ) where MyII is active ( Fig 1D, 1 and 1 ). To test the role of PIK/AKT in incisor invagination, we treated E12. 5 mandibles with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for 2 days. Compared to controls, explants treated with LY002 showed smaller and less invag incisor epithelium (4–4 Fig ). This was not due to reduced proliferation and PI inhibition resulted in a slight increase in the percentage BrU-labelled cells in the incisor when compared to control (4 Fig ) Mesymal proliferation remained unchanged (4 Fig ) indicating that epithel and mesyme responded differently to PI inhibition. The formation of the enamel in the incisor epithel, assessed by Sh, was not affected (4–4 Fig ) PI/A thus promotes incisor invagination without affecting proliferation and the establishment of the enamel signaling center. To concretely test if PI/A regulates MyII in the epithel or mesyme, we turned to genetic models. To ablate PI/A

    Title: 
    Article: The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities. 
 Single-cell genomics give us new perspectives to understand the genetics in the cellular level. With the rapid development of methods for single cell RNA sequences such as 10X Chromium ( PBMC ), Smart-seq2 [1], SNARE-seq [2] and SHARE-seq [3]. Technologies for measure other modalities, single-cell chromatin accessibility sequence [4], proteomics [5, 6], spatial transcriptomics [7] and metabolomics [8] have been developed. However, each technology only reveal a particular aspect of cellular state and identity. They both have unique strengths and weaknesses. In particular, scATAC-seq is a strong indicator of functional DNA sequence which can be used to identify cell subpopulations with different chromatin accessibility profiles. Nevertheless, scATAC-seq coupled with the sparsity of signals due to low detection efficiency and cell-type identify accuracy present a huge computational challenge. In contrast, large amounts of well-annotated scRNA-seq data have been curated [9], catalyzing us to transfer cell type information from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq. Integration of single-cell multi omics data is still a great challenge due to the heterogeneity across multiple datasets, including inherent highly sparse and imcompatible dimension between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. A large number of methods have been developed for scRNA-seq data integration. Such as scmp [10], scAlign [11], DCA [12], scVI [13]. And many methods have been developed for scATAC-seq data including chromVAR [14], cisTopic [15], Scasat [16] and SnapATAC [17]. The methods were proposed for integrating paired and unpaired single cell modalities data, such as DVAE [18], scMVAE [19], DCCA [20], Seurat [21], MOFA+ [22] and scJoint [23] have limitted performance. Moreover, in most case, datasets are unpaired. Most modalities are sampled from the same sample or tissue. In this setting, the high efficiency computational methods are scarcely and most existing methods can be classified into two categories: one kind such as Conos [24], Seurat3 [25] and Liger [26] based nearest neighbor graph structure and matrix factorization. Specifically, methods that use mutual nearest neighbors ( MNN ) for data alignment become less scalable as datasets exceed one million cell. Additionally, these methods are mainly targeted towards integrating datasets of less complex tissues and may overcorrect fine-grained cell subpopulations in more complex tissues, resulting in the loss of power to reveal interesting biological variations. Other deep learning basesd methods ( review in [27] ) such as scJoint, sciCAN [28], Poral [29], scDART [30], Glue [31] outperform many methods in the situation of integrating unpaired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. However, compared to the special-purpose networks tuned to the structure of problem space, the fully connected networks used by scJoint have weaker performance. Meanwhile, their performance varies owing to data noises, parameter settings and new input data. In order to reduce the domain discrepancy and improve the robustness of results, more powerful transfer learning methods and deep generative model should be designed. In order to simultaneously address the above challenges. Here, we propose a single-cell transfer graph convolutional network model ( Fig 1b ), which regard the label transfer from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq as the domain adaption problem in transfer learning ( Fig 1a ). This model formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationship and gene expression with graph convolutional network, which based on the kenetic relationships between the specific regulatory mechanisms of scRNAseq and scATAC-seq. And we explore the idea of MK-MMD-based adaption for learning transferable features in common embedding of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, enables our model to best leverage the domain-specific effects. scTGCN incorporates commmon information of two data modalities thorough a semisupervised paradigm to learn unlabeled scATAC-seq. Applying a wide range of single-cell omics datasets, we demonstrated that scTGCN have high label transfer accuracy. In addition, annotated data comfirm that integrative analysis by scTGCN can be applied for new cell type identification via tranfer learning. 
 Here, we regard integrating multiple datasets as domain adaption problem in transfer learning. Using the GCN network to cotrain labeled data from the source domain ( scRNA-seq ) and unlabeled data from the target domain ( scATAC-seq ) following different distribution. By leveraging labeled scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data or other modalities, cell type can be classified accurately. And it is now publicly available as a Python software ( https://github. com/kanyulongkkk/scTGCN ), which is a flexibility and scalability tool for integrative analysis single cell multimodal data. To evaluate the performance of the scTGCN, we applicated our methods on different tissues and organs from mouse and human multiomics data: The Tabula Muris atlas is a comprehensive resource for single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) data [32]. It consists of data from 96, 404 cells derived from 20 organs, using two different protocols: fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ), droplet. This atlas provides information on 73 distinct cell types. On the other hand, Cusanovich et al. presented an atlas for single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing ( scATAC-seq ) data [33]. This atlas includes data from 81, 173 cells obtained from 13 tissues. It identifies 29 different cell types, with one group annotated as ‘unknown’. Notably, there are 19 cell types that are common between the scRNA-seq atlas and the scATAC-seq atlas. Another dataset using multimodal measurements that simultaneously profiled gene expression levels or chromatin accessibility along with surface protein levels. These measurements were obtained through the CITE-seq [34] and ASAP-seq [35] techniques. Specificallly, we analyzed CITE-seq and ASAP-seq data commonly. In this experiment, cells were sequenced using both CITE-seq and ASAP-seq technologies in parallel. For each input data, we denote labeled single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) data as source domain data X S ∈ S m × n s, and the dataset that needs to be annotated as target domain data X T ∈ S m × n t, where m is the number of common gene features shared by XS and XT, and ns and nt are the number of cells in the source and target domain data. The neural networks in scTGCN consists of one omic autoencoder layer, one graph convolution layer and two fully connected layers. After apply canonical correlation analysis [37] method between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data in both source and target domain dataset. We use the mutual nearest neighbor ( MNN ) method to construct the hybrid graph leveraging the topological characteristics of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. The principle and formula of the MNN method [36] is designed to integrate and compare single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Its core idea is to identify pairs of cells that are mutual nearest neighbors in two datasets for the purpose of data integration. The steps of the MNN method we used as follow: 1. Calculate the nearest neighbors of each cell in source dataset and target dateset, respectively. 2. Construct an integrated cell-cell association graph by comparing the nearest neighbor relationships. Formula derivation for constructing the graph: we have two datasets, with m cells in source dataset and n cells in target dataset. For cell i in source dataset and cell j in target dataset, the proximity between them is defined as: s i j = exp ( - ‖ x i - y j ‖ 2 2 σ 2 ) ( 1 ) m a t r i x i j = { 1, if cell i is a nearest neighbor of cell j and vice versa 0, otherwise ( 2 ) Where ( xi ) and ( yj ) represent the expression feature vectors of cell i and cell j, respectively, and σ is a parameter controlling the proximity level. Based on the proximity, we can construct a proximity matrix S between source dataset and target dataset, where the element ( sij ) indicates the proximity between cell i and cell in source and cell j in target. The matrix S is used as input to the graph convolutional layer of scGCN. The graph convolutional layer of scGC takes the proximity matrix S as input and output a set of features for each cell. The graph convolution operation is defined as follows: h i = ∑ j = 1 n s i j w i x j ( 3 ) where h i is the feature vector of cell i, w is the weight matrix of the convolutional layer, and xj is the feature of cell j. The output of the convolutional layer is a set of features for each cell. The fully connected layer of scGC takes the output of the convolutional layer as input and output a set of features for each cell. The output of the fully connected layer is a set of features for each cell. The output of the fully layer is a set of features for each cell. The output of the layer is a set for each cell. The output of the is a set for cell. The output is a for cell. The output is cell. The output. The output. The output. The output. The output. output. output. output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output output

    Title: 
    Article: Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins. NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids; however, identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. In this study, we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling, we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which, despite lacking a single consensus sequence, retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. 
 The nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ), a short motif rich in basic amino acids, controls the import of many nuclear proteins [1–13]. Two types of NLS have been identified: monopartite and bipartite [1–3, 11–13]. A monopartite NLS consists of a single, continuous stretch of basic amino acids, including lysine and arginine [1–3, 11, 13]. The NLS from SV40’s large T antigen ( 126PKKKRKV133 ), which contains five contiguous basic residues, is a classic example of a monopartite NLS [11]. In contrast, a bipartite NLS is characterized by two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a short spacer region, as seen in proteins such as nucleoplasmin and many others [1–3, 12, 13]. Both monopartite and bipartite NLSs function by interacting with proteins in the importin family, which are key transport receptors that recognize and guide NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus [1, 14]. Structural studies have provided substantial insights into the interaction between NLSs and importin alpha, revealing that this binding involves both hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions, with multiple basic residues in the NLS contacting negatively charged residues on importin alpha [4, 15–18]. This is supported through genetic studies, which illustrate that mutating Lys-128 in the SV40 NLS to non-basic residues significantly impaired nuclear import [11, 19, 20], whereas mutating it to arginine disrupts nuclear import without affecting viral replication [20]. In contrast, mutation of a nearby basic residue in the SV40 NLS ( Lys-131 ) to methionine did not significantly affect nuclear import [20], suggesting that specific basic residues within the SV40 NLS may play distinct roles in controlling nuclear import. In addition to the SV40 NLS, other monopartite NLSs have been identified, including those in H2B, v-Jun, and various others proteins [1–10, 13]. Although these NLSs, like the SV40 NLS, are rich in basic residues, sequence variations among them raise questions about whether they interact with importin alpha in a similar manner [4, 15]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm3, a subunit of the Mini-Chromosome Maintenance ( MCM ) complex [21–24], has a monopartite NLS ( 764KSPKKRQRV772 ) that resembles the SV40 NLS but has yet-to-be fully characterized [8, 9]. In addition to the sequence similarity, several lines of evidence suggest that this sequence acts as a functional NLS for Mcm3. First, the SV40 NLS was shown to functionally substitute for Mcm3757-779, providing strong support for the role of this Mcm3 fragment in controlling nuclear import [8, 9]. Second, fusion of Mcm3755-781 with galactosidase was sufficient to direct its nuclear localization [9]. Third, fluorescence microscopy of a GFP-tagged, shorter fragment of Mcm3766-772 resulted in a modest nuclear localization signal in live cells [8], suggesting that the flanking sequences of this Mcm3 NLS are needed for optimal NLS activity. Despite these findings, the sequence specificity of Mcm3’s NLS remains to be determined. Further characterization of Mcm3’s NLS will not only help elucidate its cell cycle dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, but also refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins. Since the nuclear import of Mcm3 and its subsequent chromatin loading are essential for cell growth [8, 9], we performed mutagenesis studies to identify specific basic residues within Mcm3’s NLS that are critical for its function. To understand the effects of these mutations, we used AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) to model the binding between Mcm3’s NLS and Kap60, the importin alpha in yeast [4, 25]. 
 Prior studies identified that Mcm3755-781 was sufficient to mediate its nuclear import [9]. Sequence alignment of this fragment across various species revealed that Mcm3764-771, a shorter and flexible region within Mcm3 that is not visible in the published MCM double hexamer structures, is well-conserved in fungi ( Fig 1A ) [23, 25–30]. This conservation suggests that Mcm3764-771 is likely crucial for nuclear import, though sequences flanking this conserved region may also be necessary for optimal NLS activity. To evaluate this, we examined the effects of various mcm3 truncation mutants on cell growth via plasmid shuffling ( Fig 1B ). While truncation of the N-terminal sequences ( Mcm3742-763 ) and C-terminal sequences ( Mcm3781-885 ) flanking Mcm3764-771 does not affect cell viability, truncation of the residues immediately adjacent to the conserved motif results in impaired cell growth, as observed in the mcm3Δ771-780 mutant ( Fig 1B ). Thus, residues neighboring the conserved motif ( Mcm3764-771 ) are needed for optimal cell growth. To fully characterize the sequence specificity of the Mcm3 NLS, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis and found that K768, a highly conserved residue across fungi, mouse, and human ( Fig 1A ), plays a critical role in supporting cell viability. Mutation of Mcm3K768A severely impairs cell viability, while mutation of Mcm3R769A results in a partial growth defect ( Fig 1C ). Single alanine substitutions of surrounding residues within or near the Mcm3 NLS have no effect on cell growth ( Figs 1C and S1A ). Strikingly, Mcm3K768A occasionally accumulates colonies with enhanced growth ( survivors ) on 5-FOA plates, which are eliminated by deletion of the RAD52 gene, suggesting that these survivors arise from Rad52-dependent recombination events ( Fig 1C ). To remove the complementing URA3 plasmid expressing wild-type ( WT ) Mcm3, mcm3Δ cells were treated with 5-fluoroorotic acid ( 5-FOA ). This allowed the determination of the growth phenotypes of mcm3 mutants expressed from a LEU2-containing plasmid in the same cell. Cells were plated on media where the complementing URA3 plasmid was retained ( SC-Leu ) or lost ( 5-FOA ). mcm3 mutants with impaired cell growth were summarized in the lower panel of Fig 1C, with “++” indicating wild-type cell growth, “+” indicating partially impaired growth, and “−” indicating severe growth defects. Besides the prominent role of K768, other basic residues in the Mcm3 NLS can have redundant roles for optimal cell growth. To test this idea, we generated mutants in which two basic residues in Mcm3764-771 were mutated to alanine ( Fig 2A ). Although Mcm3K764A, Mcm3K767A, and Mcm3R771A single mutants do not affect cell growth ( Fig 1C ), combining any of them with Mcm3R769A severely impairs cell growth ( Fig 2A ). Like Mcm3K768A, these growth-impaired double alanine mutants also accumulate Rad52-dependent survivors on 5-FOA plates ( Fig 2A ). In contrast, combining Mcm3R769A with Mcm3R773A, a residue outside the conserved Mcm3 motif, does not affect cell growth ( S1B Fig ). Moreover, combining any two of the Mcm3K764A, Mcm3K767A, Mcm3R771A, and Mcm3R773A mutations also does not result in appreciable growth defects ( S1C Fig ). Thus, basic residues within the Mcm3 NLS are not functionally equivalent: K768 is the most critical, R769 plays a secondary role, and K764, K767 and R771 also contribute to optimal growth. To understand the structural basis of these findings, we used AlphaFold 3 ( AF ) to model the interaction between Mc3’s NLS and Kap60, the importin in yeast [4, 25]. AF predicts that Mc3’s N interacts with Kap60 through a hydrophobic and charge interactions ( Fig 3A ), with K768 and R769 contacting negatively charged residues on Kap60 ( Fig 3B ). These predictions are consistent with previous studies of other NLS and importin interactions [4, 15, 18]. AF also suggests that K764 and K767 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with Kap60 ( Fig 3 ), which is supported by the lack of effect of mutating these residues on cell growth ( Figs 1 and S1 ). In contrast, R771 is not involved in hydrophobic interactions with Kap ( Fig 3 ), consistent with its mutation not affecting growth (igs 1 and S1 ). AF also predicts that R769 is involved in charge-charge interactions with Kap ( Fig 3 ), consistent with its mutation impairing cell growth (igs 1 and 2 ). Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting monopite NLS, which, lacking a universally conserved sequence, retain key characteristics between the Ns of Mc3 and SV40 T antigen. The Mc3 N is a monopite N with five contiguous basic residues ( 764SPRKKR772 ) that is conserved in fungi ( Fig 1 ) and functions as a functional NLS [8, 9]. The SV40 N is a classic example of a monite N with five contiguous basic residues (PKRKV133 ) [11]. Both Ns interact with importin through hydroph and charge interactions [4, 15, 18] with basic residues in the N contacting negatively charged residues on importin [4, 15, 18]. AF predicts that Mc’s N interacts Kap through hydrophobic and charge interactions ( Fig 3 ) with K and R contacting negatively charged on Kap ( Fig 3 ), consistent with previous studies [4, 15, 18]. AF also suggests that K and R are involved in hydroph interactions with Kap ( Fig 3 ) which is supported by lack of effect on growth (igs 1 and S ). In contrast, R is not involved in hydroph interactions ( Fig 3 ) consistent with mutation not affecting growth (igs 1 and S ). AF predicts R is involved in charge-charge with Kap ( Fig 3 ) consistent with mutation impairing growth (igs 1 and 2 ) Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting monite Ns that lack a universally conserved sequence but retain characteristics between Ns of Mc3 and SV40 T. The Mc3 N is a monite with contiguous basic residues (764SPKR772 ) that is conserved in fungi ( Fig 1 ) and functions as a N [8, 9]. The40 N is a classic monite with contiguous residues (PKV ) [11]. Both Ns interact with import through hydroph and charge [4, 15 18] with residues in N contacting negatively on import [4 15 18. AF predicts Mc’s interacts Kap through hydrophobic and charge ( Fig 3 ) with and contacting negatively on ( Fig 3 ) consistent with previous [ 4 15 18. AF also suggests and are involved hydroph with Kap (3 ) which is supported by lack effect onigs 1 and S. In contrast is not involved hydroph Fig 3 consistent not affectingigs 1 S AF predicts is charge with Kap 3 consistent impairingigs 1 and 2.

    Title: 
    Article: Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ). Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2, which can help stimulate mRNA translation, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration. 
 mRNP granules are intriguing, dynamic membrane-less organelles containing translationally repressed mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs ), molecular chaperones and a variety of other cellular proteins [1–5]. The formation and composition of mRNP assemblies are determined by base-pairing interactions between mRNAs, protein-protein interactions and RBP-RNA interactions, whose respective contributions may vary across granule types and physiological states [6–9]. Stress granules ( SGs ) are particularly well-studied granules that form when cellular stress signals mediated by eIF2α kinase activation [10] cause individual mRNPs to arrest in translation and condense into multi-mRNP assemblies [11–13]. Mutations in mRNP granule proteins, including TDP-43, FUS, Ataxin-2, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, EWSR1, have been associated with ALS and/or other forms of neurodegenerative disease [14–20]. For this reason, and because TDP-43 and other stress-granule protein aggregates are components of protein inclusions found in ALS and Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ), the regulation and cellular functions of SGs have been topics of considerable fundamental and clinical interest [20–26]. The cast of intermolecular interactions required for mRNP-granule assembly and the precise sequence with which they occur are not yet elucidated [9, 27]. However, many studies show that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) found on mRNP-granule proteins contribute substantially to RNP granule assembly [28–35]. In biochemical experiments, such IDRs show the ability to phase separate into liquid-like assemblies [35–45]. The accessibility or activities of IDRs can be tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications, allowing rapid physiological and spatial control over granule assembly and disassembly [29, 35, 46–52]. An important observation is that most IDRs also can transition from liquid-like state into solid, beta-sheet rich, amyloid-fibrils in vitro, particularly at high concentrations achieved in the liquid phase [22, 41, 53–55]. This, and studies showing that inhibitors of eIF2α kinase or downstream events including SG formation can be protective in animal models of neurodegenerative disease [56–60] have led to a conceptual framework in which: ( a ) mRNP granules provide a microenvironment where pathogenic protein seeds can form and grow [54, 61, 62]; ( b ) increased misfolded protein loads result in inclusion formation, chronic stress signalling and reduced protein translation [63, 64]; ( c ) increased demand on protein handling systems results in multiple cellular defects, notably in the functions of membrane-less organelles [65–69]. In particular, aberrant SG formation also results in nuclear transport defects which may contribute to cell death and toxicity [70, 71]. Particularly strong support for the role of RNP granule formation in promoting disease comes from studies of Ataxin-2. Loss of Ataxin-2 is cytoprotective in yeast TDP-43 and Drosophila TDP-43 or C9ORF72 or Tau models of cytotoxicity [16, 61, 72–76]. In mouse models for SCA2 or ALS, either genetic loss of ATXN2 or delivery of antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) targeting ATXN2 in the central nervous system, reduced aggregation of TDP-43, increased animal survival and improved motor function [72, 77]. These observations have led to ASOs against human ATXN2 being developed and approved for clinical trials [78]. More recent genome-wide screens using siRNA and CRISPR have identified additional strategies to lower the levels of Ataxin-2 [79, 80]. Given Ataxin-2’s therapeutic significance and multiple roles in biology, it is particularly important to determine which molecular activities of the protein are relevant to disease and to its various biological functions [81]. Across species, Ataxin-2 has three conserved regions: a Like-Sm ( LSm ) domain, an LSm-associated domain ( LSm-AD ) and a PAM2 motif, which is flanked by extended IDRs [82]. Detailed work in Drosophila has shown that a c-terminal IDR of Atx2 is selectively required for mRNP assembly into granules [61]. Parallel experiments showing that the IDR is also required for cytotoxicity in Drosophila FUS, C9ORF72 and Huntington’s disease models suggest RNP-granule formation to be a significant mechanism by which Atx2 promotes neurodegeneration [61, 74]. A recent discovery that the Atx2-LSm domain antagonizes IDR-function has led to a model in which the Atx2 cIDR: ( a ) does not support mRNP assembly when Atx2 is associated with actively translating mRNAs through Atx2-LSm domain interactions; ( b ) becomes accessible and active in mediating mRNP assembly when LSm-domain interactions break and mRNA translation stalls [82, 83]. We now present a series of experiments further elaborating mechanisms by which Ataxin-2 functions in mRNA translation and mRNP assembly. These show that the PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 and its interactions with PABP are not essential for granule assembly but are required to efficiently recruit Atx2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into Ataxin-2 granules. When taken together with other findings [73, 82–84], our observations indicate that PAM2 binding to PABP on the polyA tail of mRNAs helps specify the composition of Ataxin-2 granules. We propose an early role for PAM2:PABP interactions working in coordination with the LSm domain to support mRNA translation and thereby oppose the mRNP formation [82]; as well as a later role in escorting translationally-stalled PAM2:PABP linked mRNAs into mRNP granules. In vivo experiments analysing motor decline in transgenic Drosophila indicate that the PAM2:PABP interactions also support the progression of the neurodegenerative process. We provide new evidence for fresh insight into the enigmatic role of mRNP assembly in neurodegeneration. 
 A recent work from our lab used Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ) technology to identify mRNAs associated with Atx2 in the Drosophila adult brain [83]. In vivo, the ability of an Atx2-fusion with ADARcd ( the catalytic domain of an RNA-editing enzyme, ADAR ), to edit a group of 256 target mRNAs was found to be dependent on the presence of the Atx2-cIDR, previously shown to be necessary for the formation of neuronal mRNP granules in vivo. In contrast, Atx2-ADARcd mutants lacking the LSm domain, both edited Atx2 TRIBE target RNAs and formed mRNP granules in cultured Drosophila S2 cells more efficiently than the wild-type. Thus, Atx2-ADARcd editing of target mRNAs occurs in and is reflective of mRNP granule assembly. While demonstrating a role for LSm-domain interactions in antagonizing cIDR-mediated granule assembly, these observations did not address mechanisms by which Atx2 target mRNAs are selected, or whether and how Atx2 played any role in determining the composition of RNP granules. New experiments presented here address these outstanding questions. Previous TRIBE and co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the P2 motif of At2 interacts with poly-binding protein ( PAB ) on the polyA tail of target mRNAs. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of At2-target mRN into Atin-2 granules as well as the incorporation of specific protein components into Atin-2 mNPules. We propose that the P2AB interaction is a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Atin-2 mNPules. To test the role of P2:PAB interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic Dophila expressing At2-ADcd lacking the P2 motif. In contrast to wild-type At2-AD, At2-AD lacking the P2 did not form mNP granules in the Drosila brain and failed to recruit mRN into Atin-2 granules. These results indicate that the P2 motif of At2 is necessary for the formation of Atin-2 mNP and the incorporation of mRN into Atin-2 granules. We also generated transgenic Dila expressing At2-AD lacking the LSm domain. In contrast to wild-type At2-AD, At-AD lacking L did not form mNP in the Dila brain and failed to recruit mRN intoin- gran. These results indicate that the LSm domain of At2 is necessary for the formation ofin mNP and the incorporation of m intoin- gran. We also generated transgenic Dila expressing At-AD lacking both the P2 and L domains. In contrast to wild-type At-AD, At- lacking both P and L did not form mNP in theila and failed to recruit m intoin- gran. These results indicate that both the P and L domains of At2 are necessary for the formationin m and incorporation of m intoin. We also generated transgenic Dila expressing At-AD lacking the P and L domains but with the P2 motif restored. In contrast to wild-type AtAD, At- lacking P and L but with P did form mNP in theila and recruit m intoin gran. These results indicate that the P motif is sufficient for the formationin and incorporation of m intoin. We also generated transgenic Dila expressing At-AD lacking the P and L domains with the L restored. In contrast to wild AtAD, At lacking P and L with L did not form m inila and failed to recruit intoin. These results indicate that the L is sufficient for the formation and incorporation of into. We generated transgenic Dila expressing At- lacking the P and L domains with both P and L restored. In contrast to wild-type At, At lacking P L and both P L did form m inila and recruit into. These results indicate that both the P and L domains are sufficient for the formation and incorporation of into. We also generated transgenic D expressing At lacking the P and L domains with P and L restored. In contrast to wild-type At lacking P L P and L did not form inila and failed to recruit. These results indicate that the P and L are sufficient for the formation and incorporation of into. We generated transgenic D expressing At lacking the P L domains with P and L restored. In contrast to wild-type lacking P L P did not formila and failed to recruit. These results indicate the L is sufficient for the and incorporation of into.

    Title: 
    Article: Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations. Despite recent efforts, a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated. Here, we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally, postnatally, and during lineage progression. We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being, together with Myf5, a major upstream regulator during early development. Moreover, constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb. Thus, we propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. Finally, while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy. 
 Muscle stem cells ( MuSCs ) arise during late foetal development and contribute to the postnatal growth of muscle fibres. They are the main players for reconstituting muscle fibres during regeneration. This population of stem cells emerges in an asynchronous manner in different anatomical locations, and it exhibits an unusual diversity in developmental origins and genetic regulation depending on the muscle group in which it resides [1–3]. Understanding the physiological mechanisms controlling the development of different muscle groups, and how they are selectively deregulated or spared during disease and ageing, is crucial for devising therapeutic strategies for a wide range of myopathies. Extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) include 4 recti muscles ( superior, inferior, medial, and lateral ) and 2 oblique muscles ( superior and inferior ) for movement of the eyeball, and arise from different cranial mesoderm populations [4–6]. They are spared during ageing and in Duchenne, Becker, and some limb girdle muscular dystrophies [7–9]. While the underlying causes for their sparing are unclear, intrinsic differences in MuSCs of the EOMs have been proposed as contributing factors [10–12]. Yet, the precise mechanisms governing the emergence and maintenance of these and other cranial MuSC populations remain obscure. Myogenic commitment and differentiation throughout the body is regulated by basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) comprising Myf5, Mrf4, Myod and Myogenin ( Myog ). Mouse knockout models have established a genetic hierarchy where Myf5, Mrf4 and Myod control commitment and proliferation of myogenic progenitors, and Myod, Mrf4 and Myog are involved in terminal differentiation [1, 13, 14]. Despite this uniformity in the acquisition of myogenic cell fate, an underlying heterogeneity characterises the embryonic cells that emerge in different anatomical locations. In the trunk, the paralogous transcription factors Pax3 ( Paired Box 3 ) and Pax7 ( Paired Box 7 ) regulate the emergence of muscle stem ( Pax3+ or Pax7+ ) and committed ( Myf5+, Mrf4+ or Myod+ ) cells [1, 15, 16]. Somite-derived myogenic cells are eventually lost by apoptosis from mid-embryogenesis in Pax3;Pax7 double-mutant mice [17]. In contrast, craniofacial muscles such as EOMs, facial, mastication and subsets of neck muscles, are derived from cranial mesoderm and do not express Pax3 [2, 6, 18, 19]. The early head mesoderm harbors instead a complementary set of upstream markers including Tbx1, Pitx2 and the Six gene family [20–23]. Notably, Tbx1 ( T-Box Transcription Factor 1 ), is an upstream regulator for the facial, jaw, neck, laryngeal and esophagus muscles, but not of the EOMs [18, 20, 21, 24–26]. Instead, Pitx2 ( Paired Like Homeodomain 2 ), which is also expressed in head muscles, plays a critical role as an upstream regulator of EOM development, as these muscles are lost in Pitx2 null mice [27, 28], with phenotypes being dependent on the gene dosage [29] and timing of deletion [30]. In contrast to the diversity in upstream regulators, Pax7 marks all adult MuSCs and their ancestors from mid-embryogenesis [1]. In the trunk, Pax7+ myogenic cells are primed by prior Pax3 expression during embryonic development [31]. However, the mechanisms that govern the emergence and maintenance of cranial myogenic cells are poorly understood. As Pax3 is absent in the EOMs, and Pax7 is expressed after the MRFs [32, 33], it is possible that Pitx2 or other transcription factors such as the Six family members [22, 34] specify the Pax7+ population in this location. Yet, as no MuSC lineage-specific deletion of Pitx2 has been performed in EOMs, it is unclear: i ) to what extent Pitx2 is required temporally for emergence and maintenance of the MuSC population, and its relative function compared to the MRFs and Pax7; ii ) if Pitx2 is continuously required for maintenance of the adult MuSC population. Further, global deletion of Pax7 in trunk and limb muscles leads to an extensive loss of MuSCs during early postnatal development [35–39]. Deletion of Pax7 in adult MuSCs results in reduced MuSC numbers and impaired regeneration following muscle injury [40, 41]. While Pax7 is dispensable for EOM formation during embryonic development [30], the presence of MuSCs in the EOMs of postnatal Pax7 null mice and the relative roles of Pax7 and Pitx2 in maintaining these MuSCs remain unresolved. Finally, several reports showed that expression of Pitx2 in postnatal MuSCs is higher in EOMs than in limb muscles [10, 11, 42]. As high levels of Pitx2 are retained in dystrophic and ageing mouse EOMs [42, 43] and overexpression of Pitx2 was reported to enhance the regenerative potential of dystrophic skeletal MuSCs [44], Pitx2 could potentially contribute to the sparing of EOMs in muscular dystrophies. However, the functional role of Pitx2 in EOM MuSCs in mdx mice has not been formally evaluated to-date. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal functional roles of Pitx2 and Pax7 in the emergence and maintenance of the EOM progenitor population using combinations of genetically modified and lineage traced mice. Our study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages in vivo and identifies differential cycling states, dynamics of commitment, and establishment of MuSC quiescence in EOMs compared to limb muscles. We show that Pitx2 is critically required for establishing the EOMs prior to Pax7 expression but is subsequently dispensable. Moreover, our findings clarify the behavior of MuSCs in the EOMs in mdx mice thus providing valuable developmental and clinical insights. 
 Previous studies suggested that EOMs have more MuSCs per area and per tissue weight than limb muscles such as the Tibialis anterior ( TA ) [45, 46]. To determine if the higher density of MuSCs in vivo results from a longer proliferative phase of EOM Pax7+ cells during embryonic and postnatal development, we performed co-immunostaining of Pax7 and the proliferation marker Ki67 on tissues sections from E ( embryonic day ) 14. 5 to 4 months postnatally ( Fig 1A and 1B ). As expected, the total numbers of Ki67+Pax7+ cells were progressively reduced during postnatal growth in both muscles. Yet, MuSCs in the EOMs stopped proliferating by P ( postnatal day ) 14, whereas proliferating Pax7+ MuSCs continued to be observed in TA muscle at P20 ( Fig 1C ). Thus, EOM Pax7+ cells exited the cell cycle earlier than those in the TA. In the TA, cycling Pax7+Ki67+ cells persisted in pre-pubertal muscle ( P28 ) before quiescence was achieved between 7–8 weeks [47] ( Fig 1C ). Notably, the density of EOM Pax7+ MuSCs remained higher in the orbital layer, probably due to the smaller fibre size compared to the global layer ( S1A Fig ). Finally, given that lineage tracing experiments suggested that constant myonuclear turnover takes place in adult EOM [48], we tested whether MuSC in the EOM proliferate in mdx mice. We found significantly fewer Pax+ MuSC in the EOM of mdx mice compared to controls ( Fig 2A and 2 ). Moreover, MuSC in the EOM of mdx mice did not proliferate ( Fig 2C ). In contrast, limb Mu in mdx mice proliferated ( Fig 2 ). These results suggest that MuSC in EOM are not spared in mdx mice as previously reported [7, 9, 49 50], but are instead lost and non-proliferative. Overall, our study demonstrates that Pitx is required for the emergence of MuSC in EOM and is dispensable postnatally. Moreover, we show that MuSC in EOM adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOM have a higher content of Pax7 MuSC per area pre- and postnat. Finally, while MuSC in limb proliferate in md mouse model Duchenne muscular dystrophy, less MuSC are present in the EOM of md mouse compared to controls and are not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of Mu heterogeneity along the body axis and brings insights into the sparing of EOM during muscular dystrophy.

    Title: 
    Article: With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) and its increasing adaptation to humans, several variants of concern ( VOCs ) and variants of interest ( VOIs ) have been identified since late 2020. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron parent lineage, and other variants. These variants may show distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, which require specific defense and control measures. In this study, we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks ( PINNs ) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network ( VOCs-INN ). In our experiments, we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia ( BC ) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada. Furthermore, it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions. VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data. 
 The evolution and mutation of viruses are typical processes that allow them to adjust to various environments and hosts. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to evolve and mutate. Since October 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants with significant mutations have emerged and been classified by the WHO as VOCs ( variants of concern ) or VOIs ( variants of interest ). These variants exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune evasion capabilities, and responsiveness to treatments. According to the WHO’s updated definition in March 2023, compared to VOIs, VOCs represent major evolutionary advancements and necessitate substantial public health measures. To evaluate the risk, simulating the transmission mechanism within the population and determining the time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial. Epidemiological models, represented by parameterized differential equations, are essential tools for studying the patterns of COVID-19 transmission and developing prevention and control strategies [1–7]. The input parameters, which may vary over time, can impact the model’s predictability. Various methodologies can be used to fit the trend of disease progression and determine the values or ranges of parameters. These methods primarily depend on mathematical models and statistical principles, along with the analysis of actual epidemiological data, such as the least squares method [8], the Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) approach [9], and the iterative filtering method [10]. The methods mentioned above may face some limitations in practical applications. Furthermore, factors like intervention measures, human activities, and virus mutations could potentially alter the parameters of the epidemic model over time. However, most parameter estimation techniques assume these parameters remain constant over time. Therefore, it can be difficult to accurately estimate how these parameters change over time and capture the complex dynamics of infectious diseases in real-world situations using these methods. Recently, deep neural networks ( DNNs ) [11] have emerged as a strong approach for tackling complex problems in various fields. They have been utilized not only in areas like autonomous driving [12], image recognition [13], and natural language processing [14], but also in predicting and detecting the spread of epidemics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, deep neural networks have proven to be useful in developing various simulation frameworks for predicting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic [15, 16]. In these studies, Arora et al. employed different versions of Long Short-Term Memory ( LSTM ) within Recurrent Neural Networks ( RNN ) to estimate the number of infected cases in India [17]. Shahid et al. compared predictive models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ( ARIMA ), Support Vector Regression ( SVR ), LSTM, and Bi-directional LSTM ( Bi-LSTM ) to forecast confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in ten major countries affected by COVID-19 [18]. Similarly, Zhou et al. assessed predictive models including LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Generalized Regression Neural Network ( GRU ), and Dense-LSTM for predicting the trend of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in the time series data of twelve major countries impacted by COVID-19 [19]. Other research has also adopted similar methodologies [20–22]. These studies demonstrate the varied applications of neural network architectures in epidemiological forecasting during the global health crisis. Although these models exhibit good data fitting and short-term prediction abilities, their failure to account for epidemiological transmission mechanisms complicates the accurate interpretation of disease spread patterns. To tackle this issue, several researchers have incorporated compartmental models into Physics-Informed Neural Networks ( PINNs ). Their work indicates that this approach enables the estimation of temporal changes in model parameters with reasonable accuracy and provides dependable predictive methods [23–25]. This, in turn, offers plausible explanations for the efficacy of certain control strategies and the fundamental dynamics of epidemic transmission. For example, Kharazmi et al. applied PINNs to analyze various variants using the classic SIR model, with the aim of determining time-dependent parameters [26]. Ning et al. combined compartmental models with DNN to create Epidemiological priors informed deep neural networks ( Epi-DNN ), which aids in simulating the complex dynamics of COVID-19. They tested the effectiveness of Epi-DNN using real COVID-19 data from the Shanghai Omicron outbreak [27]. He et al. introduced Transmission Dynamics Informed Neural Networks ( TDINN ), which encode two versions of the compartmental model into DNN to predict time-dependent parameters [28, 29]. They validated these predictions using real COVID-19 data from various regions and provided thoughtful interpretations of epidemic-related interventions. Saikia et al. utilized PINNs to analyze the ratio of undetected to detected active infections during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in India, giving a realistic picture of the Indian pandemic [30]. These studies demonstrate that the use of PINNs can estimate time-varying parameters within compartmental models with accuracy and offer a fresh perspective on understanding epidemic spread mechanisms, providing useful insights for the development of effective prevention and control strategies. In this study, we introduced a new VOCs-INN algorithm, which integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. It should be noted that the VOCs-INN algorithm emphasizes learning underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve model optimization and achieve accurate fitting. This algorithm is capable of fitting multi-source epidemic data effectively, and it can also be applied in scenarios involving a single virus. In such cases, the multi-strain model can be simplified to the classical SIR model with time-varying parameters, as proposed in 1927. Additionally, we applied this algorithm to analyze data from two VOIs in British Columbia ( BC ) and five internal health institutions in Canada. The VOCs-INN algorithm also demonstrated good performance in simulating both observed and unobserved dynamics, facilitating time-dependent parameter inference and enabling short-term predictions. Furthermore, we compared the VOCs-INN algorithm with traditional fitting methods, showcasing its advantages in fitting accuracy and predictive performance. This analysis further supports the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed algorithm. The remainder of this study is structured as outlined below. In the subsequent section, we will introduce the multi-strain infectious disease model and deep neural networks, establish the VOCs-INN algorithm, present the datasets utilized, and outline the experimental settings. Subsequently, we will share the key findings related to data fitting, parameter estimation, and predictions. We will also delve into the impact of time-varying transmission rates and the effective reproduction number on COVID-19 transmission, and validate the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Additionally, we will discuss comparisons between our proposed algorithm and traditional methods. Finally, in the discussion section, we will summarize our research findings. 
 Based on the fundamental SIR epidemiological model, we propose an SI1…InR epidemic model with VOCs. The transfer diagram is shown in Fig 1. Denote the number of VOCs by n, and the population is divided into susceptible individuals S ( t ), infectious individuals Ii ( t ) infected by the i-th VOC ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n ), and recovered individuals R ( t ). Additionally, we include auxiliary compartments, Iic, to keep track of the cumulative confirmed cases of infection by the i-th VOC. The parameters may change over time due to various factors, including government interventions, shifts in human behavior, virus mutations, and vaccination efforts. Therefore, to simulate the actual transmission dynamics of the pandemic accurately and effectively, we assume that the transmission rates and removal rates are functions of time, denoted by βi ( t ) and γi ( t ). Table 1 describes the meaning of state variables and parameters. Consequently, the corresponding model is expressed as follows: {dSdt=-∑i=1nβi ( t ) SIiN, dIidt=βi ( t ) SIiN-γi ( t ) Ii, i=1, 2, …, n, dRdt= ∑i=1nγi ( t ) Ii, dIicdt=βi ( t ) SIiN, i=1, 2, …, n, ( 1 ) with intital conditions S ( 0 )=S0, Ii ( 0 )=0, R ( 0)=0, Iic ( 0)=0, i=1, 2, …, n, n, where S ( t ) is the number of susceptible individuals at time t, Ii ( t ) is the number of individuals infected by the i-th VOC at time t, R ( ) is the number of recovered individuals at time t, and Iic ( ) is the cumulative number of confirmed cases by the i-th VOC at time. The parameters β ( t ) and γ ( t are the time-vary transmission and removal rates, respectively, and N is the total population size of the population. The model ( 1) is a system of ordinary differential equations with time-vary coefficients, which can be solved using numerical methods such as Euler’s method or Runge-Kutta’s method [31, 32]. However, solving (1) analytically is challenging due to the time-vary parameters. To address this, we propose the VOC-IN algorithm, which combines PINs with the model (1) to estimate timeary parameters and simulate the dynamics of COVID-19. In the next section, we introduce the VOC-IN algorithm. 
The proposed VOC-IN algorithm combines PINs with the SIR model (1) to estimate timeary parameters and simulate the dynamics of COVID-19. The architecture of VOC-IN is shown in Fig 2. The VOC-IN consists of two main components, the SIR model (1) and PIN. The SIR model (1 describes the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, while the PIN estimates the timeary parameters of the SIR model. The PIN is a neural network with input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The input layer receives the data from the S model (1, including the number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and cumulative confirmed cases. The hidden layer is composed of neurons with ReLU activation function. The output layer outputs the timeary parameters of the SIR model, including the transmission and removal rates. The VOC-IN is trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. The architecture of VOC-IN is shown in Fig 2. The VOC-IN is trained on data from British Columbia ( BC ) and five health institutions in Canada. The VOC-IN demonstrated good performance in simulating observed and unobserved dynamics, time-dependent parameter estimation and short-term predictions. We compared VOC-IN with traditional methods, showing its advantages in accuracy and predictive performance. The VOC-IN can be applied to various scenarios, including single-strain and multi-strain models. In single-strain model can be simplified to the classical SIR with timeary parameters, proposed in 192. The VOC-IN can also be used to analyze data from VOIs and VOCs. In the next section, we present the datasets and experimental settings.

    Title: 
    Article: Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells, but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. We introduce CytoSummaryNet: a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework, providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies. Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. 
 High-throughput assays enable quantifying cellular responses to perturbations at a large scale. Image-based assays are among the most accessible and inexpensive such technologies that offer single-cell resolution. Cell populations are perturbed with compounds or genetic perturbations, stained, and then imaged. Large amounts of quantitative morphological data are extracted from these microscopy images, generating tabular data comprising single cell profiles. These single cell profiles are then aggregated by a variety of methods to a per-perturbation profile that describes that population’s phenotype. The profiles of different cell populations can be compared to identify previously unrecognized cell states induced by experimental perturbations. This method, called image-based cell profiling, is a powerful tool that can be used for drug discovery, functional genomics, and disease phenotyping [1]. Among other applications, image-based profiling has already been used to predict assay outcomes for compounds [2–4], detect leukemia label-free [5], and predict the impact of particular gene mutations [6]. Image-based cell profiling shows great potential, but many steps in its pipeline can still be improved [1]. One of the challenges is to capture both population trends and single-cell variability. Cell populations are known to be heterogeneous [7, 8], and recent studies have yielded many insights into the mechanisms and importance of this characteristic [9–12]. Capturing that heterogeneity could improve a profile’s information content and, thus, utility in many image-based profiling applications. Despite its current limitations, so-called population-averaged profiling, where all single-cell features are averaged per feature using either the mean or the median, remains the most commonly-used approach in the field of image-based profiling. This is true regardless of the types of features or the kinds of transformations ( e. g., normalization, feature selection, etc. ) applied to the profiles [13, 14]. Average profiling is a simple way of summarizing a cell population ( hereafter referred to as a sample ) into a vector ( a sample’s profile ) with only one value per measured feature. It dramatically decreases the data size ( as there are typically thousands of cells per well, hundreds of wells per plate, and multiple plates per experiment ) and simplifies downstream analysis. The biggest drawback of average profiling is that information on cell subpopulations is lost. This can result in identical average-aggregated profiles despite cell populations having distinct internal structures. Additionally, ignoring subpopulations can lead to a quantitatively incorrect interpretation. For example, two cell populations can show correlations among certain features when averaged but show completely different relations when compared after grouping the cells, i. e., Simpson’s paradox [15]. Lastly, averaging a sample essentially assumes each measured feature corresponds to a simple unimodal distribution. If this is not the case, e. g., as in the case of heterogeneous cell populations, the average will be a poor summary statistic for the data. Several methods have been proposed to capture the heterogeneity of cell populations into their corresponding profiles. The most straightforward solution is to incorporate the cell population’s dispersion ( e. g., standard deviation ) for each extracted feature and concatenate these values with the average-aggregated profile. This approach is widely adopted but offers only minor improvements over average profiling [16]. A later study suggested that incorporating the sample histogram–instead of dispersion–may offer improvements [17]. A different approach involves first clustering cells and then calculating the profiles based on their subpopulations [18, 19]. These methods capture more information about subpopulations rather than only incorporating their dispersions but did not significantly improve upon average profiling [16]. Furthermore, they can lead to incomparable profiles across experiments unless the subpopulations are defined beforehand. As well, many cell phenotypes are better described with a continuous rather than a discrete scale [13]. In our previous work, we improved the performance of average profiling by fusing features’ averages, dispersion, and covariances [13]. This method provided ~20% better performance predicting a compound’s mechanism of action and a gene’s pathway, showing that capturing statistics related to cell population heterogeneity can improve performance on downstream tasks. However, this method has two major limitations. First, it only captures the first- and second-order moments of the data. Second, because it produces a similarity matrix rather than an embedding, it requires recomputing the pairwise similarities among all profiles each time a new profile is included in the dataset. Here, we introduce a novel method that addresses both of these limitations and automatically finds an effective way to aggregate single-cell data to improve the information content of sample profiles. 
 We propose CytoSummaryNet: a self-supervised contrastive learning approach that leverages the naturally available information in profiling experiments ( Fig 1B ). Contrastive learning is a method where data points corresponding to the same entity–for example the same sample–are brought closer together while others are pushed apart in a feature space [20]. In doing so, it aims to capture generalizable features beneficial for a broad range of tasks. Here, we use perturbation identifications ( IDs ) as labels to train a latent feature space that distinguishes samples with different IDs. In this feature space, profiles of replicates with the same perturbation should be close to each other, while those of different perturbations should be further apart ( Fig 1D ). This labeling approach frames the problem as a multiple-instance learning problem [22], assuming that the replicate wells consist of cells with similar feature distributions, and that different compounds generate populations with distinct feature distributions. Although not every perturbation yields a profile distinct from all others, these assumptions collectively contribute to the development of a feature embedding that captures biologically significant morphological variations. Importantly, we here apply contrastive learning to already-extracted single-cell features, as opposed to raw pixels, making it immediately applicable to most image-based profiling datasets, where extracted features are readily available. We treat the data as a collection of sets of cells, where each sample ( all cells from a single well ) corresponds to one set ( based on the mathematical definition of "set" ). To aggregate cells from such a sample into a profile, the function we want to learn should possess a few properties. First, it should be capable of handling input samples of arbitrary sizes. Second, because cells within a sample are, by definition, unordered, the function should be permutation invariant. Several methods have been developed for analyzing this type of data [23, 24], and a general formulation for addressing this problem is known as Deep Sets [25]. Zaheer et al. [25] revealed that a function acting as a universal approximator for sets has a specific structure, consisting of a permutation-invariant function and a learnable representation function. This structure provides a foundation for designing neural networks capable of processing unordered data represented as sets ( Fig 1C ). We therefore chose to employ the Deep Sets formulation to learn a model ( CytoSummaryNet ) that aggregates single-cell feature data into a profile ( CytoSummaryNet profiles ) that outperforms population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound’s mechanism of action. This is achieved through self-supervised contrastive learning within a multiple-instance learning framework, which allows the model to process groups of data–labeled only at the group level rather than the individual data point level–and to make classifications based on the collective information of these groups. We evaluate the training task ( replicate retrieval, i. e., retrieving profiles of other replicate wells of the same compound ) and the downstream task ( retrieving profiles of other compounds annotated with the same mechanism of action ) using the mean average precision ( mAP ) metric [26]. This information retrieval metric indicates whether all the positive examples can correctly be identified without erroneously marking too many negative examples as positive. We evaluated CytoSummaryNet on two fronts: ( i ) testing its generalizability across unseen compounds and experimental protocols, and ( ii ) a practical application scenario where we trained the model on a large dataset and subsequently measured its performance on mechanism of action retrieval for that dataset. We first investigated CytoSummaryNet’s capacity to generalize to out-of-distribution data: unseen compounds, unseen experimental protocols, and unseen batches. The data split strategy is visualized in Fig 2, and the results of these investigations are visualized in Figs 3, 4, and 5, respectively. We performed this analysis on the cpg0001 dataset [21] from the public Cell Painting Gallery [27], which consists of 384-well plates with identical sample layouts of 90 unique compounds, i. e., there is a single “plate layout” for the entire dataset ( See Experimental Setup ). We trained CytoNet on 80% of the compounds and tested on the remaining 20%. The results show that CytoNet generalizes well to unseen compounds and experimental protocols ( Figs 3, 4, 5 ). Next, we applied Cyto to a practical scenario where we trained the model on a large dataset and measured its performance on mechanism retrieval of action for that dataset. We trained on the c000 dataset [28] from the Cell Painting [27], which consists of 384-well plates with sample of 100 unique compounds, i. e., there is a single “ layout for the entire dataset ( See Experimental ). We trained Cyto on 80% of the compounds and tested on the remaining 20%. The results show that Cyto significantly outperforms population-averaging on mechanism retrieval of action ( Figs 6, 7, 8 ). This demonstrates that Cyto can be used as a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles to boost performance on image-based datasets.

    Title: 
    Article: The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction inhibition, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns. The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEG microstates ) and optimal transport theory. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. By utilizing a fully data-driven method, this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain. 
 The complex activity patterns that support perception, cognition, and behavior in the healthy brain arise from the interactions of neuronal populations across various spatial and temporal scales [1]. At the macroscale, brain activity is characterized by spatially distributed groups of regions that exhibit temporally correlated activity and co-activate during behavioral tasks, thus acting as functional networks [2]. Recently, it has been shown that such functional networks may reflect the long-time average of rapidly switching metastable patterns ( also called “metastable substates” or “dynamical states” ), which are consistently observed with different imaging methods [3–7]. In the M/EEG literature, these patterns are termed “microstates” and are highly reproducible across studies and clustering techniques [8–10]. As our environment is constantly evolving, with new stimuli and challenges emerging regularly, our brain must remain flexible and adaptable to respond effectively to these changes. A crucial component that drives such reconfiguration is “executive functioning” or “cognitive control” [11–13]. This construct refers to the set of processes and mechanisms that enable goal-directed behavior in the face of changing circumstances [11, 14–16]. When confronted with challenging situations, cognitive control allows the brain to regulate attention, inhibit irrelevant information, and shift cognitive resources to prioritize relevant tasks or goals [17]. Concurrently, it has been shown that the dynamical properties of the metastable substates during different active conditions are modulated compared with the resting state. Such adaptation has been demonstrated in a large variety of conditions such as cognitive loads [18], sleep-awake cycle [19], habituation of cognitive tasks [20], and is reflected in the overall reconfiguration of functional connectivity [21–23]. Importantly, alterations in the dynamic of brain states were found in psychiatric [8, 24] and neurological disorders [25] and during normal aging [26]. Therefore, developing quantitative measures for quantifying the cost of such reconfiguration in the brain is crucial for explaining the impairments and guiding the possible effects of therapeutic interventions [27]. In recent years, much attention has been captured by the network controllability framework for measuring the brain transition cost [28, 29]. Control theory based tools offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from its network organization. In addition, control theory provides a quantitative way of computing the control cost as the amount of energy needed to steer a system along a desired trajectory. Despite its potential and broad spectrum of applications, it has some strong limitations [30, 31]. For instance, it relies on the assumption of linearity in the dynamics. However, linear models fail to capture non-linear [32] and higher-order [33] phenomena ubiquitously encountered in brain dynamics. Moreover, stochasticity is not considered, but it is essential for accurately describing many aspects of brain function [34]. A promising approach for circumventing these limitations in quantifying the cost of control consists of reframing the task into a Schrödinger bridge problem [35, 36]. More specifically, given an initial and a target probability distribution, representing, for instance, the distribution of metastable substates during resting and task conditions, the Schrödinger bridge problem asks for the most likely path or "bridge" that connects the two probability distributions given the spontaneous ( resting ) stochastic dynamics of the system. The transition cost is then estimated as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures distances in the probability distribution space, between the baseline trajectory and the bridge. Intuitively, it measures the cost of “transporting” one distribution into another by a stochastic process that satisfies some given constraints. Indeed, the Schrödinger bridge problem has been proven to be formally equivalent to an ( entropy-regularized ) optimal transport problem [37, 38]. Recently, such an approach was applied to an fMRI dataset of participants performing several cognitive tasks [39]. The authors show that the transition cost from the resting condition to the various tasks varies significantly, thus proposing this approach might be suitable for describing neurophysiological data. However, the tasks were qualitatively different and difficult to compare, thus there were no strong prior expectations of the task difficulty and the expected cognitive demand. Additionally, the reliability of individual differences in task-based fMRI activity is known to be quite poor [40], especially in the absence of long time series, as typically occurs in fMRI data, thus hindering the possibility of a subject-level analysis. Hence, in [39] time series data from individual subjects were combined to create a unified meta-subject dataset. Therefore, the analysis was exploratory and the reliability of such a metric remains limited. Moreover, in many contexts of cognitive interests, fMRI is not a suitable tool to measure neural correlates of behavior. For instance, one of its primary constraints is its inherent limitation to cognitive tasks that do not involve significant physical movement. This is a notable drawback, as many cognitive processes and behaviors inherently entail motor actions. In this work, we bridge this gap by generalizing the above method to electroencephalography ( EEG ) signals, which moreover measure neural activity more directly than fMRI. Specifically, we analyze an EEG dataset on participants performing a spatial Stroop task. The Stroop task is a standard experimental paradigm in cognitive psychology that investigates different aspects of cognitive control and executive functions, including selective attention, response inhibition, and interference resolution, by assessing the interference effect from conflicting stimulus features [41]. In its spatial variant [42–44], participants are typically presented with arrows pointing in different directions ( e. g., top left or bottom right ) and are asked to indicate the direction of the arrow through a spatially compatible button press. However, the pointing direction may conflict with its spatial location. For example, an arrow pointing to the top left corner might appear on the bottom right side of the screen. Typically, participants are slower and less accurate in incongruent conditions ( i. e., when the spatial location of the arrow conflicts with the direction it is pointing to ) than in congruent conditions ( i. e., when spatial location and pointing direction coincide ). This interference effect, referred to as the “Stroop effect”, is believed to reflect the difficulty in suppressing the automatic processing of the spatial location of the stimulus in favor of the task-relevant information ( the arrow direction ), with the consequent activation of a wrong response code that then needs to be suppressed. Commonly, it is computed as the difference in the response time ( RT ) between incongruent and congruent trials. Cognitive control demands can be further manipulated by varying the proportion of congruency ( PC ), namely the proportion of congruent trials in a given task block [45–47]. Indeed, in high-PC blocks, conflict is less likely, and cognitive control demands are lower, whereas, in low-PC blocks, trials are mostly incongruent, and cognitive control is more required [45, 48]. Therefore, due to our well-defined quantitative prior expectation of cognitive demands, this dataset is ideally suited for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed framework to estimate brain transition costs. Here, we first characterize the dynamics with a microstate analysis, which reveals that different conditions modulate the distribution of microstates. Next, we calculate the transition cost for each participant from the resting state to the various conditions. We observe a higher cost for incongruent stimuli. Importantly, this cost is significantly influenced by the level of cognitive control. Moreover, we find a correlation between variations in the cost and RTs, showing that a reduced cost is associated with improved task performance. Overall, these results highlight the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes and offer insights into the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance. 
 In this work, we analyzed an EEG dataset recently collected ( see “Dataset” section; Fig 1A ). This dataset encompasses EEG recordings collected from a cohort of 44 participants during both a 5-min eyes-open resting-state session and a task-oriented sessions. Specifically, the task involved a spatial Stroop task designed with blocks featuring three distinct PC values ( 25%, 50%, and 75% ) to systematically manipulate the level of cognitive demands. The task was performed on a computer screen with a button press response. The EEG was recorded using a 64-channel system at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0. 1–100 Hz. The data were preprocessed using a standard pipeline ( see “Materials and methods” section ), including artifact removal, re-referencing, band-pass filtering, and independent component analysis ( ICA). Microstate analysis was performed on the preprocessed data using a sliding window of 500 ms with a step of 100 ms. The microstates were identified using k-means clustering with a threshold of 0.5. The transition cost was computed using the Schrödinger bridge approach as described in the “Methods” section. RTs were computed as the difference between the response time of congruent and incongruent trials. PC was calculated as the proportion of congruent trials in each block. The correlation between the cost and RTs was computed using a linear regression. The results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) unless otherwise stated.

    Title: 
    Article: Expansion of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals. To date, the generation of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function in protective humoral immune responses is unknown. Here, P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs, and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness, and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies, a single MBC was cultured, and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity. The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures, and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones. Thus, we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. Notably, B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. The somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different. Together, our findings revealed that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs. The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. 
 Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite. It predominates outside Africa, especially in Asia and Latin America, with more than 14 million cases occurring each year. More than one third of the global population is at risk of vivax malaria [1]. Given the rapid spread of drug-resistant parasite strains and the formation of hypnozoites in the liver with potential to cause relapse and the diversity of antigens, a highly effective vaccine to prevent the disease is essential [2, 3]. Antibodies play a crucial role in controlling malaria infections [4, 5]. Naturally acquired antibody responses against P. vivax infections increase with age as a result of repeated exposure to the parasite [6, 7]. These antibodies do not prevent infection but do decrease parasite density, the frequency of clinical symptoms and disease severity [8]. In the blood stage of malaria, the binding of antibodies to parasite antigens disrupts the interactions between parasite ligands and cognate host receptors required for red blood cell invasion [5, 9]. Among blood stage antigens, the P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein region II ( DBPII ) is the central molecule necessary for the invasion of reticulocytes through its ability to bind Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines ( DARC ) on the reticulocyte surface [10]. The genetic polymorphism within this protein is known to alter its antigenic character with induction of short-lived and allele-specific naturally acquired anti-DBPII antibodies [9, 11, 12]. Strain-transcending humoral immunity has been detected in only a few individuals despite repeated exposures [8, 13]. Based on these concerns, a successful DBPII-based vaccine strategy relies on targeting relatively conserved antigenic epitopes to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. A successful malaria vaccine needs to be able to elicit long-term protective immunity. The function and longevity of anti-malarial antibodies are highly variable, with some individuals acquiring long-term protection following a limited number of exposures, whereas others may require repeated exposures to generate such protective immunity [14, 15]. This observation has led to the hypothesis that the slow and imperfect acquisition of humoral immunity to malaria is associated with impaired development of MBCs or antibody secreting cells ( ASCs ). During acute vivax malaria, MBCs are detected which are specific to the parasite’s pre-erythrocytic or blood stage antigens [14, 16–19]. These P. vivax-specific MBCs persist in subjects who recover from infections, some for as long as 3–4 years [14, 17], indicating a capacity of P. vivax parasites to induce the development and maintenance of MBCs. However, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding the durability of P. vivax-specific MBC responses and whether repeated infections are necessary. If so, how frequent is boosting necessary for acquisition of long-lasting and functionally active MBC responses. In the context of short-lived MBC responses to malaria, the accumulation of aMBCs has been associated with the poor acquisition of long-term immunity to Plasmodium infections. Expansion of aMBCs ( CD21-CD27-Tbet+ ) was found in chronic P. falciparum exposure in regions of high malaria endemicity [20–22]. These cells overexpress inhibitory receptors ( FCRL5, CD11c and CXCR3 ), and have a reduction in the B-cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling pathway, leading to ineffective B cell production of antibodies [20, 21]. However, a recent study showed that aMBCs responded to membrane-associated antigens [23]. Comparing the stimulation of aMBC responses by low-versus high-affinity antigens showed little or no difference, indicating that aMBCs selectively reduced responses to low-affinity antigens [24]. Additionally, aMBCs produce antibodies with the help of T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells [25]. In vivax malaria, an increased frequency of aMBCs was observed during both the acute and recovery phases of infections [14, 26–28]. Through study of in vitro cultures, aMBCs were shown to secrete immunoglobulin after receiving IFN-γ and IL-21 signals [26]. These previous reports were based on bulk aMBCs, of either CD21-CD27- or CD21-CD27-Tbet+FCRL5+ phenotype. The specificity of these expanded aMBCs, and the function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs are unknown. Our generation of fluorochrome-labeled P. vivax antigens, along with staining for aMBC markers, should provide insights into the development of these P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function. In the present study, we demonstrate specificity of aMBC responses and the role of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. The leading vaccine candidate, PvDBPII was taken to generate tetramer probes to detect antigen-specific aMBCs during the acute and recovery phases of infections, demonstrated the capability of aMBCs to produce neutralizing antibodies, and assessed the potential inhibitory activity of aMBC-derived IgG and human monoclonal antibodies ( HuMoAbs ) in inhibition of erythrocyte binding by a panel of PvDBPII allelic variants. Our findings will help guide the design strategy for a P. vivax malaria vaccine which will overcome the challenges posed by polymorphic antigens. 
 Expansions of bulk aMBCs have been reported during acute P. vivax malaria [14, 27, 28]. However, there is still limited knowledge on the specificity of the aMBCs. Given the potential of PvDBPII as blood-stage vaccine candidate [29, 30], this study used the most immunogenic variant alleles ( PvDBPII-TH2, -TH5 and reference Sal I strains ) [14] among Thai isolates to detect P. vivax-specific aMBCs. PBMCs from P. vivax patients ( n = 28 ) and healthy controls ( HCs; n = 17 ) were stained with PvDBPII tetramer probes. The gating strategy of specific IgD-MBCs is shown in Fig 1A. During acute infections, significantly higher frequencies of MBC-specific to PvDBPII-TH2 ( average 0. 022%, SD 0. 020% ) and PvDBPII-TH5 ( average 0. 008%, SD 0. 010% ) were observed in vivax patients compared to those in HCs ( PvDBPII-TH2; average 0. 004%, SD 0. 003%; PvDBPII-TH5; average 0. 003%, SD 0. 004% ) ( Fig 1B ). Only 6 samples showed a positive specific MBC response to the reference Sal I allele ( patients; average 0. 004%, SD 0. 007%; HCs; average 0. 003%, SD 0. 003% ) ( Fig 1B ). To address the development of MBCs against diverse variant strains of PvDBPII, we analyzed whether infected individuals had positive MBC responses to 1, 2 or all 3 PvDBPII variants. Interestingly, of the 28 patients, three ( 10. 71% ) had specific MBCs to all tested antigens, eight ( 28. 57% ) to two variants, and 17 ( 60. 7% ) to one PvPI ( Fig 1C ). These results indicate that P. viv infections elicit the development of MBC to multiple PvPI variants. During the recovery phase of infections, MBC to PvPI-TH2 and PvPI-5 were significantly higher than in patients compared to HCs ( Fig 1D ). Notably, MBC to PvPI-TH and PvPI-5 persisted in patients for up to 6 months post-infection ( Fig 1E ). These findings suggest that P. viv-specificMBC are elicited during the acute phase of infections and persist through the recovery phase. To investigate the function of P viv-specificMBC in producing antibodies, single MBC were cultured and the secreted IgG tested for binding and inhibitory activity. aBC-derived IgG showed variable levels of anti-PvPI in cultures and some produced high levels comparable to classical M clones. We focused on the function of aBC in producing neutralizing antibodies. Among aBC clones A12 and B11 produced broadly neutral antibodies against panel PvPI variants. Notably BCRs of PvPI-specificM expressed unique IGH genes with usage IGH1 comparable to classical M. The somatic hypermutation SH and CDR length VH and Vκ of these M subsets were not significantly different. Together our findings that P viv infections elicited the development of P viv-specificM and the accumulation aM during infections might play a role in producing antibodies against malaria.

    Title: 
    Article: Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics, especially in the context of precision medicine. Recently, mr. mash, a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy, was introduced. However, a drawback of mr. mash is that it requires individual-level data, which are often not publicly available. In this work, we introduce mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel. By using summary data, we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr. mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data. Through simulations, we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes, the number of phenotypes, the number of causal variants, and the genomic heritability. We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has smaller sample size. 
 Predicting complex trait phenotypes from genotypes is a central task of a few branches of quantitative genetics. In agricultural breeding, there is interest in predicting breeding values ( EBV ) to select the best individuals for reproduction and achieve an increase in performance over generations [1]. In human genetics, predicting medically relevant phenotypes such as disease risk via polygenic scores ( PGS ) is important to stratify the population and identify individuals with greater genetic risk [2]. Finally, with the advent of transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ), predicting gene expression as an intermediate step has become of interest [3]. In all these applications, accurate predictions are important. The response to artificial selection is directly proportional to the accuracy of EBVs [4]. Precise identification of individuals at risk for a particular disease requires accurate PGS [2]. The power to discover gene-phenotype associations in TWAS depends on the accuracy of gene expression prediction [5]. Technically, phenotypic prediction is achieved by modeling the phenotype of interest as a multiple regression on genotypes at a set of genetic variants [6]. Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to multiple regression have been developed for and/or applied to this task, with accuracy spanning from very low to high depending on the genetic architecture of the trait analyzed [7–12]. Multiple phenotypes may be genetically correlated due to pleiotropy ( i. e., the sharing of causal variants across traits ). In that case, modeling these phenotypes jointly via multivariate multiple regression methods can improve effect sizes estimates by leveraging effect sharing and, thus, increase prediction accuracy [13–17]. Integrative approaches that combine multiple single-phenotype PGSs across phenotypes have also been shown to improve prediction accuracy [18, 19]. Recently, Morgante et al. ( 2023 ) introduced the “Multiple Regression with Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage” or “mr. mash” [20]. mr. mash is a Bayesian approach to multivariate multiple regression that is able learn complex patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes directly from the data. This is achieved through the use of flexible priors on the effect sizes across phenotypes and an empirical Bayes ( EB ) framework to adapt these priors to the data. Computational effiency is achieved by using Variational Inference ( VI ) as opposed to the more expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methods. For a detailed account of VI and EB in this context, including the advantages, we direct the reader to [20]. Using multi-tissue gene expression prediction from cis-genotypes as an example, the authors showed that mr. mash is competitive in terms of both prediction accuracy and speed [20]. However, while powerful, mr. mash has some limitations. First, mr. mash requires individual-level data, i. e., genotypes and phenotypes for each individual and, mainly for privacy reasons, these data are rarely publicly available [21]. Second, mr. mash does not scale well to datasets with very large sample size, such as modern biobanks. These weaknesses limit the use of mr. mash for PGS prediction in human genetics. In this work, we overcome both these limitations by introducing “mr. mash Regression with Summary Statistics” or “mr. mash-rss”, an extension of mr. mash that only requires summary-level data. These are effect sizes and their standard errors ( or Z-scores ) from univariate Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWASs ) and Linkage Disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from reference panels, which are usually publicly available [21]. mr. mash-rss shares some features with the established Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage ( mash ) [22], in that they both use the same mixture-of-multivariate-Normals prior on the effect sizes to leverage effect sharing across conditions ( e. g., different phenotypes ), and the EB approach to adapt the prior to the data. In fact, both mr. mash and mr. mash-rss “borrow” this framework that was introduced with mash. However, while mash assumes that the input summary statistics come from independent variables ( i. e., it does not deal with LD ), mr. mash-rss takes a full multivariate multiple regression approach and adjusts effect sizes for both sharing across conditions and correlations among variables ( i. e., it takes LD into account ). We test mr. mash-rss in the task of PGS prediction for multiple phenotypes jointly via simulations in several scenarios and show that it is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy with currently available methods. We then confirm these results in the analysis of real data for 16 blood cell traits in the UK Biobank [23, 24]. 
 Following the approach of [27], we express the updates in mr. mash in terms of sufficient statistics. The likelihood for the mr. mash model is ℓ ( B ; X, Y, V ) ≔ M N n × r ( Y ; X B, I n, V ) =| 2 π V | - n / 2 exp { - 1 2 tr [ V - 1 ( Y ⊺ Y - Y ⊺ X B - B ⊺ X ⊺ Y + B ⊺ X ⊺ X B ] }. ( 3 ) We can see that X⊺X, X⊺Y, and Y⊺Y are sufficient statistics for the likelihood. Thus, the mr. mash model can be fitted using expressions based only on these sufficient statistics ( see S1 Text for detailed derivations ) to obtain the same results as using individual-level data X and Y. The sufficient statistics can be recovered from effect sizes and their standard errors ( or Z-scores ) from GWAS and LD estimates, following steps provided in [27] and S1 Text. We call mr. mash with summary statistics mr. mash-rss. However, it should be noted that while X⊺Y can be recovered exactly, X⊺X is only approximated when LD estimates come from reference panels, rather than from the data that generated GWAS summary statistics [27]. Thus, using summary data can be seen as fitting the mr. mash model using an approximation to the likelihood in 3 [27]. The quality of the approximation depends on how closely the LD reference panel matches the GWAS summary statistics. Quality control should therefore be performed on summary statistics and LD before model fitting [27, 28]. In addition, Y⊺Y may not be available. However, this quantity is not strictly necessary, unless V is estimated within the mr. mash-rss algorithm [27]. While mr. mash has a way to deal with missing values in Y, mr. mash-rss assumes the summary statistics be computed using the same individuals for each response ( i. e., there are no missing values in Y ). The methods introduced in this paper are implemented in the R package [29] mr. mash. alpha which is available for download at https://github. com/stephenslab/mr. mash. alpha. 
 We devised a simulation study where the goal was to compare mr. mash-rss and other competing methods at computing PGS for multiple phenotypes from summary data. We used real genotypes from the UK Biobank array data for n = 105, 000 nominally unrelated White British individuals that were randomly sampled. After applying a series of filters ( see S1 Text for details ), the data included p = 595, 071 genetic variants. We simulated r = 5 phenotypes according to three scenarios that differed in the structure of the effect sharing across phenotypes. Causal variants ( 5, 000 for all scenarios ) were randomly sampled from all genetic variants. These three scenarios were similar to those used in [20], but some parameters ( e. g., number of causal variants ) were modified to reflect more closely the genetic architecture of complex traits, rather than gene expression. We also simulated a few scenarios based on the Equal Effects scenario ( i. e., equal effects of the causal variants across phenotypes ) to assess the effect of genomic heritability, number of phenotypes, and number of causal variants on mr. mashss performance. We compared mr. mashss to the following methods : ( 1 ) Multivariate Adaptive Shrink ( mash ) [20], ( 2 ) Multivariate Linear Regression ( MLR ) [30], ( 3 ) Elastic Net [31], ( 4 ) Lasso [32], ( 5 ) Ridge [33], and ( 6 ) Bayesian Lasso [34]. For each method, we computed the mean squared error ( MSE ) between the predicted and true phenotypes. The results are shown in Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15, 16, 17 18, 19 20, 21, 22 23, 24 25, 26 27, 28 29, 30, 31 32, 33 34, 35 36, 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 49 50 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 69 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99 103 107 111 119 127 135 143 151 159 167 183 199 207 223 239 259 279 319 359 399 499 499 599 599 699 799 899 999 1099 1199 1299 1399 1599 179 1999 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 1099 1199 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 1099 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 1099 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 1099 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 1099 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 1099 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 109 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 109 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 109 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 109 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359 399 499 599 699 799 899 109 119 129 139 159 179 199 219 239 259 299 319 359

    Title: 
    Article: Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases, but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel modelling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models, by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model. Simultaneously, we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods. Subsequently, we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80. 06% and 3. 17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99. 97% and 32. 78%, thus providing an 18. 6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data. Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37. 36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days, also aligning with the real case. We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity. 
 Over the past few decades, emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, influenza A H1N1, and SARS-CoV-2, have posed significant threats to global public health [1–3], and the control of such infectious diseases has garnered considerable attention from researchers [4, 5]. Mathematical models play a crucial role as tools for understanding the transmission mechanisms of emerging infectious diseases, predicting epidemic trends, and evaluating transmission risks. These models can aid in optimizing control strategies to enhance global public health and reduce economic costs [6–8]. In particular, the precise prediction of epidemic trends serves as a foundational basis for decision-making in the implementation of control interventions. However, there are numerous challenges associated with achieving accurate predictions, with heterogeneity being one of the significant obstacles to achieving precise predictions. A susceptible population is usually defined as comprising those individuals who can be infected by a virus or other pathogen. The transmission of pathogens occurs through several mechanisms: one is direct transmission involving physical contact between infectious individuals and the susceptible population, as seen with many respiratory viruses. In another mechanism, unique to vector-borne diseases transmission occurs when an infected vector, such as a mosquito, bites a susceptible human. Sexually transmitted diseases are spread through sexual contact, which can include any form of sexual activity involving the exchange of body fluids. However, regardless of the transmission mechanism, the simplest SIR model structure assumes that all susceptibles are equally likely to be infected by infectious individuals, even though many of them may not have the opportunity to come into contact with an infectious individual simultaneously due to a heterogeneous contact structure or spatial processes. Therefore, when considering the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptibles, the actual susceptible population in homogeneous models should consist of individuals actively involved in the transmission process—those with an approximately equal probability of encountering infectious individuals. Moreover, additional susceptible individuals may have increased contact with infectious individuals as the epidemic spreads spatially. This phenomenon is intuitively observed in nearly all outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 ( henceforth COVID-19 ) and other infectious diseases. For instance, Fig 1 illustrates the spatio-temporal shift of confirmed cases during a local outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Shanghai, China, from 1 to 17 March 2022. In this scenario, the Chongming district of Shanghai reported its first case on 17 March 2022–17 days after the diagnosis of the initial confirmed case in the Putuo district on 1 March 2022. This observation underscores the dynamic nature of the susceptible population and its involvement in the transmission process as infections spread over space and time. The significance of spatial heterogeneity has long been acknowledged in epidemic modelling, highlighting the limitations of homogeneous assumptions [9, 10]. Consequently, numerous studies have explored various methods to incorporate spatial heterogeneity, yielding a wealth of intriguing findings [11–14]. Patch, network and spatial reaction-diffusion models can serve as frameworks for modelling the intricacies of spatial heterogeneity. Numerous existing studies have demonstrated that these modelling frameworks qualitatively enhance our understanding of the underlying transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases [11, 12, 15, 16]. Nevertheless, there are challenges in establishing connections between these models and real-world data, conducting quantitative analyses, and making predictions due to their inherent structural complexity. Specifically, there is a scarcity of epidemic data with high-resolution spatial information, or the available data exhibit a granularity that is too coarse to effectively capture spatial nuances. Additionally, fitting epidemic data to network models or spatial diffusion equations proves to be highly challenging owing to the intricate nature of the model structures. Furthermore, the complexity of these model structures hinders the comprehensive analysis or prediction of fundamental epidemic indices, including peak values, final sizes and herd immunity. For this reason, homogeneous compartment models are frequently used in scenario analysis to predict the epidemic trends of emerging infectious diseases due to the huge advantages of this modelling framework, given the aspects of parameterization, interpretability, ease of calibration, computational efficiency and strong predictive capabilities. Although spatial heterogeneity has been recognized in epidemic modelling for decades, most research has focused on modifying the transmission terms within homogeneous compartmental models to incorporate spatial heterogeneity. Consequently, various types of incidence rates have been proposed, revealing a range of complex dynamic behaviours [10, 17, 18]. However, the transmission terms describe a process in which there is no explicit spatial behaviour ( no ‘movement parameters’ ), although spatial distribution and movement is implicitly incorporated. Subsequently, in various scenarios, the prediction accuracy of the existing homogeneous models may be compromised by oversimplification, as they tend to disregard important heterogeneity factors. Several recent studies [19, 20] have developed explicit methods that incorporate spatial heterogeneity to quantify the spatio-temporal transmission of wildlife diseases. However, these methods require high-resolution spatial data. Therefore, exploring novel approaches that explicitly integrate spatial heterogeneity within homogeneous compartmental modelling frameworks to add new insights for modelling heterogeneity, particularly for precise ( by involving heterogeneity ) and efficient ( by leveraging the advantages of homogeneous model framework ) prediction of epidemics, is the scope of this study. The main purpose of this study is to develop a generalized modelling framework that embeds spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the susceptible population into the homogeneous models. The ultimate aim is to leverage the homogeneous compartment model for conducting efficient prediction of epidemic trends, and simultaneously enhance the prediction accuracy of the epidemics. In the next section, we firstly develop a generalized framework, and design a machine-learning approach and pre-set a specific form to shape the recruitment process from the epidemic data of COVID-19. Subsequently, we apply our proposed model to project the epidemic trends of various COVID-19 variants as case studies, conducting tests and evaluations to compare prediction accuracy with traditional homogeneous modelling frameworks. Finally, we discuss the biological implications and the prospective applications of our novel modelling framework. 
 The classical SIR compartment model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [21, 22] is: S′=−β0cISN, I′=β0cISN−γI, R′=γI, ( 1 ) where S, I, R denote the susceptible, infectious, and recovered populations, respectively, N = S + I + R denotes the total population in the considered region, which is constant as dN/dt = 0. Here, we consider the variables as the absolute population while the units are listed in Table 1. The parameter γ is the recovery rate. The term β0cSNI is the standard incidence rate for describing the transmission of the disease. That is, each infectious individual can generate a constant number of contacts c per unit time with a transmission probability β0 per contact, correspondingly, β = β0c is usually called the transmission rate. In addition, S/N is the probability at which each infectious individual contacts with susceptible individuals, because only the contacts between infectious and susceptible individuals can transmit the pathogen. The fundamental premise underlying homogeneous models is that the population is homogeneously mixing, so the proportion of infectious individuals around any susceptible individual is equal regardless of the location of the individual in the area. Consequently, when considering a single new outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, the entire population is considered as the initial condition for the susceptible class, i. e. ( S ( 0 ) = N ). Over the past few decades, the SIR model has undergone extensive extensions to various frameworks, such as SEIR and SEIHR models. However, most of these extensions have retained the assumptions related to managing the susceptible population [23–27]. As discussed in the introduction, such assumptions are deemed unreasonable due to their overlooking of spatial distances between individuals. To establish a more realistic modelling framework, we posit that transmission only occurs among the population within a small neighbourhood of all the infectious individuals, who are also assumed to be uniformly mixed within the neighbourhood. Therefore, the transmission among the population within the neighbourhood can be appropriately modelled within the homogeneous compartment model framework, specifically concerning the transmission of the pathogen through physical contacts. In this context, an individual in the susceptible class can be infected by an infectious individual in the same neighbourhood with a probability 0, where 0 < 0 1 is the probability of contact between susceptible and infectious within the same neighbourhood. The probability 0 can be interpreted as the proportion of individuals in the neighbourhood that are infectious. In this scenario, the transmission rate of the pathogen within the neighbourhood can be modelled as β0S0I, where 0 is the number of infectious in the neighbourhood and S is the number of susceptibles in the same neighbourhood. The transmission rate β0S0 can be interpreted as the number of contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals in the neighbourhood per unit time. In this scenario, the neighbourhood can be defined as a circle of radius r around an individual, where r is the density of the population in the area. In this scenario, the number of individuals in the neighbourhood is πr2, where π is the area of the circle and is the density of the population. Therefore, the transmission rate βS0 can be written as β0Sπr2, where is the density of the population. In this scenario, the probability of contact between susceptible and infectious in the same neighbourhood can be written as 0 = πr2, where is the density of the population. In this scenario, the transmission rate of pathogen within neighbourhood can be modelled as βSπ2I, where is the number of infectious in neighbourhood and is the number of susceptibles in neighbourhood. In this scenario, the rate βπ can be interpreted as the number of contacts between susceptible and infectious in neighbourhood per unit time. In this scenario, the neighbourhood can be defined as a circle of radius r around an individual, where is the density of population in area. In this, the number of individuals in neighbourhood is πr, where is area of circle and is density population. Therefore, the transmission rateS can be written βπr, where is density population. In this, the probability contact between susceptible and infectious in neighbourhood can be written  =r, where density population.

    Title: 
    Article: Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations. 
 Synapses are inherently unreliable in transmitting their input to the post-synaptic neuron. For example, the probability of neurotransmitter release is typically around 50% [1–3] and can be as low as 20% in vivo [4]. In other words, up to 80% of synaptic transmissions fail due to release unreliability, providing one of the major sources of noise in the synapse. Pre- and post-synaptic noise sources result in a large trial-by-trial variability in the post-synaptic current ( PSC ) [5]. At the same time, synapses are very demanding in terms of energy consumption [6], suggesting that a large portion of the body’s energy intake dissipates by the unreliability of synaptic transmission. Similar to biological synapses also neuromorphic technologies are exposed to noise culminating in unreliable synaptic transmission [7–9]. The functional implication of noisy synaptic transmission, and whether it is a feature or bug in biological and artificial neuronal systems, is therefore highly debated [5, 10–13]. Here, we show that synapses can exploit noisy synaptic transmission to encode their uncertainty about the somatic membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. With each synapse doing this, we further show that this enables a neuronal network to encode and utilize uncertainties. To establish this result, we rely on the predictive processing model framework to describe biological systems that act in uncertain environments. Predictive processing ( PP ) is based on the idea that biological systems instantiate an internal model of their environment that allows them to make predictions, take actions, and to minimize surprise [14–17]. In the PP formalism, an agent uses internal states to form an internal model of its environment based on perceived stimuli ( Fig 1Ai ). We focus here on a form of surprise that results from the mismatch between the agent’s internal state and the feedback from the environment through sensory stimuli ( see e. g. [18, 19] for an in-depth discussion of different definitions of surprise ). In general, these stimuli map only parts of the environment’s true state, implying an unavoidable residual level of uncertainty. To reduce the uncertainty, the agent uses the internal model to formulate predictions about the environment and performs actions to test these predictions. These actions may lead to new stimuli that provide feedback about the environment’s true state, triggering an update of the internal model. We apply PP to individual synapses, arguing that the dynamics of a synapse can be considered as an agent interacting with its cellular environment, and derive a synaptic learning rule by minimizing the surprise in individual synapses. This learning rule enables synapses to adapt their synaptic efficacy to best predict future postsynaptic spikes, which are registered by back-propagating action potentials ( bAPs ). In contrast to previous approaches ( e. g., [20] ) that used PP to understand the influence of neuromodulatory signals such as Dopamine on synaptic plasticity, we focus here on a PP perspective of synaptic plasticity [21, 22], unraveling the dynamics of a single synapse governed by only locally accessible quantities such as the pre- and postsynaptic-spike times and the current value of the synaptic efficacy. This is the only assumption made in our model. The presented synaptic plasticity rule follows directly from this assumed interaction between a synapse and its post-synaptic neuron. Predictive processing has emerged as a powerful normative theory to derive biologically plausible rules for synaptic plasticity from first principles, and a number of previous studies have explored this, e. g., to address the role of neural compartmentalization [21, 22], cortical mocrocircuits [23], and dendritic trees for few short learning [24]. In the current study we focus on the temporal dynamics of the uncertainty that is being induced by sparse back-propagating action potentials and the role of noise in synaptic transmission. This synapse-centric view on predictive processing allows us to study the precise timing of synaptic dynamics in terms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We call our new model the synaptic predictive processing ( SPP ). The emergent synaptic plasticity rule reproduces a number of experimentally observed effects of long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and depression ( LTD ) protocols and predicts precise forms for the influence of synaptic and neuron parameters. The SPP suggests that synapses probe their environment by sending stochastic synaptic currents and integrate the arriving feedback ( bAPs ) to update their internal state ( synaptic efficacy ) to better predict the somatic dynamics. Thus, every stochastic release event can be seen as a “small experiment”, that is based on previous experience and the outcome of which shapes subsequent future activity. In other words, as we show here, the task of a synapse to learn suitable synaptic responses can be considered as a problem of behaving in a partially unknown environment, where the variability in synaptic release is being used to properly represent the uncertainty of the synapse about the cellular, environmental state. On the network level, our computer simulations indicate that SPP allows several thousand synapses to exploit their synaptic noise to successfully master different learning paradigms despite ambiguous or uncertain inputs. 
 We used the leaky integrate and fire ( LIF ) neuron model [25] in all experiments, where the somatic membrane potential u ( t ) at time t > 0 follows the dynamics τ m d u d t = - ( u ( t ) - u 0 ) + R y ( t ), ( 1 ) where τm is the membrane time constant, u0 is the resting potential and R the membrane resistance. y ( t ) is the external input current into the neuron, and denotes the effect of afferent synaptic input at time t. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold ϑ, the neuron emits an action potential, such that the spike times tf are defined as the time points for which the criterion t f : u ( t f ) = ϑ, ( 2 ) applies. Immediately after each spike, the membrane potential is reset to the reset potential ur [25] lim δ → 0u ( t f + δ ) = u r, ( 3 ) and we define the initial state of the neuron u ( 0 ) = ur. In network simulations, we used a simple threshold adaptation mechanism to control the output rate of the neurons. Individual firing thresholds ϑ were used for every neuron. If not stated otherwise, thresholds were decreased by a value of u adapt ( - ) = 5 × 10 - 5 mV in every millisecond and increased by u adapt ( + ) = 10 - 2 mV after every output spike. Thresholds values were clipped from below at the resting potential u0. A detailed derivation of the synapse model can be found in Sections 1–8 in S1 Appendix. We use a stochastic synapse model of input-dependent PSCs, where the variability is proportional to the synaptic efficacy w [26]. The amplitudes of current pulses, y, were drawn from a Gaussian distribution, y ∼ N ( y | r 0 M w, s 0 M 2 w ), independently for every input spike, where w is the synaptic weight and M is a scaling parameter. The parameter s0 of the stochastic PSC model was chosen to be a Gaussian approximation of the Binomial distribution with s0 = r0 ( 1 − r0 ). The scaling parameter r0 corresponds to the synaptic release probability [26]. Input currents y ( t ) were generated as follows: For every pre-synaptic spike, a sharp current pulse was generated and scaled with the amplitudes, sampled randomly and independently, and injected into the post-synaptic neuron. At all other times, the synaptic inputs y ( t ) were 0. If not stated otherwise, the synaptic efficacies w were updated using the learning rule, Δ w = W LTP ( Δ t 1, Δ t 2 ) - ( 1 2 + w ) W LTD ( Δ t 1, Δ t 2 ) + 1 2 w, ( 4 ) where W LTP ( Δ t 1, Δ t 2 ) and WLTD ( Δt1, Δt2 ) are the triplet STDP windows as depicted in Fig 2. Δ t 1 = t 2 post - tpre and Δ t 2 = t post - t pre are the time differences between pre- and post-synaptic spikes, and t pre and t post are the times of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes, respectively. The learning rate α was set to 0. 01. The synaptic efficacies were clipped between 0 and 1. The synaptic efficacies were initialized randomly between 0 and 1. In simulations, we used a network of 1000 neurons with 1000 synapses per neuron. Synaptic efficacies were initialized randomly between 0 and 1. Synaptic efficacies were clipped between 0 and 1.

    Title: 
    Article: Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells. 
 Reconstructing cell lineage trees, from single-cell data, for healthy tissue is a fundamental computational problem with enormous potential for studies of development and differentiation [1–6]. There are two related reconstruction problems for cancer tumors: reconstruction of clonal trees and the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies from single cells. Several data types, e. g., bulk DNA, single-cell DNA, and single-cell RNA, have been used for the latter two problems [7–11]. All these reconstruction methods exploit mutations and attempt to reconstruct trees in which the proximity between a pair of cells, or clones, is correlated with the similarity between their patterns of mutations. The somatic mutation rate in humans is 10−9 per locus per cell division [12], and the copy number is not considered to carry substantial information regarding cell lineage membership in healthy tissue. Therefore, mutations are scarce when reconstructing lineage trees for healthy tissues, implying that more sophisticated models and computational methods are needed to capitalize fully on the existing mutations. This scarcity also highlights the need for single-cell DNA sequencing ( scDNA-seq ) data since it reveals more point mutations than any other current data type [13]. Regardless of its potential to reveal mutations, scDNA-seq data comes with its challenges [14–18]. Due to the small amount of genomic data available in a single cell, the genome needs to be amplified before sequencing [19]. Unfortunately, the whole-genome amplification methods, such as the multiple displacement amplification ( MDA ) method [20] and the multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles ( MALBAC ) method [21], introduce technical artifacts known as amplification errors ( AEs ) that are hard to distinguish from mutations. Moreover, so-called allelic dropout ( ADO ) events remain even after the amplification. In addition, the subsequent sequencing of the amplified materials introduces sequencing errors [22–25]. There have been several methods explicitly made for scDNA-seq data, both for identifying mutations ( single nucleotide variant ( SNV ) callers ) and for reconstructing cell lineage trees, although several of them are targeting cancer data. Monovar [26] is an SNV caller designed specifically for scDNA-seq data; for each position, it models the ADO with a Bernoulli distribution, the AEs with independent and identically distributed ( i. i. d. ) Bernoulli random variables and base-calling error probabilities depend on Phred quality scores, [27, 28], while utilizing dynamic programming. LiRA [29] and Conbase [30] are scDNA-seq SNV callers that leverage read-phasing, while the latter does variant calling based on the population of single cells. There has been a sequence of single-cell tree reconstruction methods targeting cancer data, [31–36], leading up to the SCIΦ method [37]. Interestingly, for the cancer case, the infinite sites assumption ( ISA, [38–40] ) may be violated due to segmental deletions. However, for healthy tissue, the ISA is an appropriate assumption. So, since SCIΦ is based on ISA, it is also relevant to the analysis of healthy tissue. SCIΦ has a probabilistic model that allows joint SNV calling and tree reconstruction using the Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) method. More recently, the Phylovar [41] method was shown to handle millions of loci and be faster than SCIΦ while having similar accuracy by taking advantage of the efficient vectorized computations. 
 Scuphr is a distance-based phylogenetic inference method that reconstructs cell lineage trees from scDNA-seq data, produced by experimental procedures that amplify the cells’ genomes, using amplification methods such as the MDA method [20] and the MALBAC method [21]. Analyses of this data type need to distinguish somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification. Therefore, Scuphr relies on a probabilistic model of read-phasing and these two error sources. Read-phasing is a technique applied to identify which allele the read comes from, which is used to distinguish if the read could be from a mutated or a non-mutated segment. We first describe our model without read-phasing and then introduce the details of the read-phasing. The amplification process is modeled as a generalized Pólya urn process, in which a drawn ball with an error probability is replaced by one of the same color and one of another, in contrast to the ubiquitous replacement by two of the same color in the Pólya urn. The observed Phred scores define the base-calling error probabilities. The model also contains a probability for the ADO events. Another vital part of Scuphr is a dynamic programming-based inference algorithm that, based on the error model, computes the probability that two cells have different genotypes at any investigated potential mutation site. Scuphr processes the scDNA-seq data using a site selection method that identifies the candidate sites that will be analyzed using the probabilistic model and contribute to the distance. The distance is obtained by combining the probabilities of different genotypes across the selected sites for each pair of cells. Finally, this distance is used as an input to a distance-based phylogenetic method, the neighbor-joining ( NJ ) algorithm [42]. The summary of the Scuphr workflow is shown in Fig 1. The input to Scuphr consists of bulk and single-cell DNA reads. First, candidate mutation sites are detected using the site selection method, Fig 1a. These candidate mutation sites can consist of a single base pair, like in most state-of-the-art methods, or two base pairs where the candidate mutation site is accompanied by a nearby germline SNV ( gSNV ). We call these site types singleton sites and paired sites, respectively. These site types will be referred to as sites throughout the paper. Second, site-associated distance matrices are calculated in parallel for each selected site, Fig 1b. Third, a single distance matrix is obtained by combining the site-associated distance matrices, Fig 1c. Finally, the cell lineage tree is reconstructed by applying the NJ algorithm to the final distance matrix, Fig 1d. In addition, the site-associated distance matrices can be sampled with replacement several times to obtain bootstrap lineage tree samples, which could be used to get consensus trees and edge supports. The read-phasing assists in identifying missing data and separating somatic mutations and errors using patterns of co-occurrence of the nucleotides at the gSNV loci and the candidate sites. Fig 1e shows an example of a non-mutated and a mutated cell’s genome. Each cell has two alleles; one maternal and one paternal. The first locus is a gSNV, where the nucleotides at the first and second allele differ. The second locus is the candidate site, where the non-mutated cell has the reference nucleotide in both alleles, and the mutated cell has a reference and an alternate nucleotide. The non-mutated and mutated cells have the same second allele, and their difference is due to the mutation located at the first allele. The mutation is associated with the blue gSNV nucleotide. In Fig 1f, a read with the candidate site is shown. One cannot decide if this read comes from a non-mutated or a mutated genome since no information is available for the gSNV locus. Therefore, it cannot be attributed to any of the alleles. In Fig 1g, a read from the site pair is observed. Since both nucleotides are observed, and the blue gSNV nucleotide accompanies the candidate reference nucleotide, one can conclude that the read comes from the non-mutated genome. However, in Fig 1h, the reference nucleotide is accompanied by the pink gSNV nucleotide, which could come from either of the genomes. 
 In order to compare the performances of the methods in a controlled way, we synthetically generated datasets. We created the ground truth cell lineage trees, and assigned mutations to the edges of the tree; all cells under the edge inherit the mutation. We generated the genomes of the cells and simulated the amplification and read sequencing processes. We accounted for various amplification, allelic dropout, and sequencing errors, as well as different levels of gSNVs within the genome. The details of the synthetic data generation process are presented in Methods. We used the synthetic datasets to compare the methods in two ways; the lineage tree reconstruction accuracy and runtime. In this section, the accuracy of Scuphr SCIΦ, and Phylovar are compared using a fibroblast dataset previously used in [30]. The dataset used in this study is a slightly modified version of the dataset in [30]. For details, see S1 Appendix. The dataset consists of scDNA-seq data for 18 cells with a total of mutations. We compared the accuracy of the three methods in reconstructing the tree using the ground truth. The results are shown in Fig 2. Scup outperforms SCI and Phyvar in terms of accuracy. We also compared the three methods in terms of runtime. The results are shown in Fig 3. Scup is faster than SCI and Phyvar. In addition to the synthetic datasets, we applied Scup to a biological dataset of scDNA-seq data from [43]. The results are shown in Fig 4. The tree reconstructed by Scup is shown in Fig 5. In conclusion, we presented Scup, a distance-based method for reconstructing cell lineage from scDNA-seq data. Scup handles the challenges of single-cell sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. The embarrass parallel design of Scup makes it faster than state-of-art methods while maintaining accuracy. The robustness of Scup was investigated using synthetic and biological datasets.

    Title: 
    Article: An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” ( HBPs ), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future. 
 How should limited resources be allocated to achieve the greatest possible return in health? This difficult question is one every public healthcare provider must grapple with; it is however a particularly urgent one in low-income settings, where available financial resources are limited, and their inefficient allocation results in a much larger loss of health and life [1]. A widely adopted strategy to address this question and inform the allocation of healthcare resources in many low- and middle- income countries is through the design of “health benefits packages” ( HBPs ). HBPs seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should focus on delivering, given that it is unable to take financial responsibility for the full range of possible services [2]. Although the objectives of HBPs are well defined, focusing typically on efficiency and equity in resource allocation, identifying the appropriate design for HBPs is far more challenging [3, 4]. The complex generative processes undertaken by stakeholders must address a wide range of concerns, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, which include ( but are not limited to ) burden of disease, cost-effectiveness ( CE ), budget impact, cultural and political acceptability, financial risk protection, equity [5], and feasibility of implementation [6], all of which need to be considered in the context of health financing mechanisms [7]. For transparency and clarity in the interpretation of complex considerations, the use of quantitative methods is recommended [8] to formally weigh evidence in support of different interventions. Examples of such methods include league table [1] and constrained optimisation [9, 6] approaches usually established to maximise population health from limited resources, and multi-criteria decision-analysis ( MCDA ) [8, 10, 11] which seek to rank interventions on the basis of multiple criteria, including those on which quantitative evidence is not readily available or hard to obtain. They additionally include analyses which focus on priority setting for resource allocation in health [12, 13]. These quantitative analyses are then feed into the wider deliberative process of adopting an HBP. These quantitative inputs into HBP design, however, are faced with a number of methodological limitations. The incidence of relevant diseases and medical conditions is assumed to be independent, such that important comorbidity effects and interactions in the availability of interventions are not captured, as well as possible shifts in the epidemiological context over time. Issues of double-counting also affect the estimated return from the inclusion of different interventions based on CE evidence alone [14]. In addition, these analyses use CE estimates which necessarily include intrinsic assumptions about the probability of access and uptake and probability of service implementation, which happened to hold true for the country and period in which the data were collected ( although attempts have been made, for example, through WHO-CHOICE, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions at different levels of coverage [15] ). Evidence for such analyses must indeed be drawn from disparate sources ( see the “Disease Control Priorities Network” [16] and the “Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Registry” [17] ) which may rely on evidence obtained from diverse geographical and temporal contexts, as well as different methodologies. Even in the case of current, country-specific CE estimates, the intrinsic nature of such context-dependent assumptions limits the ability of CE evidence-based analyses to consider predicted or hypothetical changes—for example, if seeking to evaluate an HBP strategy in conjunction with programmes aiming to remove financial barriers in access and uptake—hence severely restricting the range of scenarios these analyses can evaluate. CE estimates may also fail to capture pre-diagnosis costs [18]. Finally, while methods are available to account for the estimated uncertainty in the available CE evidence [19, 20], a complete lack of relevant evidence on a significant number of interventions means that these must be excluded a priori from quantitative analysis [16], although this issue can be overcome through participatory and deliberative processes ( including the use of MCDA [18] ). One of the countries that relies on CE evidence analyses as input to its HBP deliberative process is Malawi ( see page 49, [21] ). The Government of Malawi ( GoM ) is indeed committed to meeting Sustainable Development Goal 3. 8 of achieving Universal Health Coverage ( UHC ) [21]. With a total combined annual healthcare expenditure from government and donors of $ 39. 8 per capita per year [22], the financial resources available to deliver this commitment are extremely scarce. The GoM has therefore taken a proactive approach to resource prioritisation, and its Health Sector Strategic Plan ( HSSP ) I ( 2011–2016 ) [23], II ( 2017–2022 ) [24], and III ( 2023–2030 ) [21] were all based upon HBPs informed by such LCOA and MCDA ( as referenced in each HSSP ). In this work we introduce, for the example of a Malawi-specific setting, a novel approach to the quantitative evaluation of potential HBPs based on the individual-based epidemiological model Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ). The TLO model is designed to comprehensively forecast, specifically in the context of Malawi, the health outcome achievable by any HBP while: Crucially, this country-specific predictive tool therefore addresses the limitations in CE evidence-based analyses outlined above, and as such can provide a useful and additional input to the country’s HBP generative process. In particular, our analysis evaluates a limited set of possible HBPs to establish the relative reduction in the overall health burden that could be achieved through different prioritisation strategies, and to showcase how model-based analyses can offer an important insight into the factors that make individual HBPs particularly successful or unsuccessful in achieving this outcome. The HBP performance evolution over time is also evaluated. 
 We use the TLO simulation ( 1 www. tlomodel. org ) [25] to simulate the health impact that may be realised in Malawi under alternative, credible formulations of the HBP when ensuring that ( a ) services delivered by the healthcare system are constrained by a realistic estimate of the time available from its workforce, ( b ) services take a realistic amount of time to be delivered, and ( c ) all other aspects of the healthcare system are analogous to the status quo ( including clinical practice and availability of consumables, beds, and equipment ). Each possible formulation of the HBP is modelled as a statement of the relative priority that is placed on a particular service, or on a particular group of patients ( e. g. currently pregnant, or living with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ). High-priority services or patients will be attended first, such that lower-priority ones will only be attended if healthcare workers still have time available to do so, resulting in a healthcare system that preferentially delivers certain services over others. Although exclusion of services will in some cases be considered, this statement of priority is a more nuanced version of the “in or out” decision for each service that has been used in other analyses ( see the discussion on this point in section 4 ) ; for consistency, we will refer to the HBPs considered in this analysis as “prioritisation policies” from now on. The analysis is agnostic to how such gradations of “priority” are to be realised in practise ( e. g. reserved times in clinics for certain patients, dedicated facilities for particular services, the addition or removal of certain services entirely from public sector healthcare ). Instead, it is designed to reveal the type of outcome that such operational decisions may aim to realise. The TLO simulation starts on 1 January 2010, and is calibrated to data in the period 2010–2020. Input from the Malawian Ministry of Health, as well as from several clinicians working in the country, was sought and accounted for at all development stages of the model, alongside a large number of data sources ( see supplementary material ). The TLO is a mechanistic model, meaning that it is based on the underlying biological and epidemiological mechanisms of disease and health-seeking behaviour of the population, as well as the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on resources. This is in contrast to other models which rely on regression or machine learning [26, 27]. The TLO is also calibrated to country-specific, meaning that the parameters of the model are informed by data from Malawi, rather than generalised from other settings. This is important as the epidemiology of disease and health-seeking behaviour can vary significantly between countries [28, 29]. The TLO has been shown to be a useful tool in other settings [30, 31], and has been used to evaluate the impact of interventions [32, 33]. In this work, we use the TLO to simulate the impact of different HBPs on the health of Malawian population over the period 2013–204. We considered a number of plausible formulations of the HBP, including one based on constrained optimisation ( LCO ), prioritisation based on patient characteristics ( PC ), and prioritisation based on service ( PS ). Each formulation of the HBP was modelled as a statement of the priority that is placed on a particular service or group of patients, as described above. The formulation of HBP based on LCO was designed to maximise the health gain from the available resources, by concentrating on high-impact interventions. The formulation of HBP based on PC was designed to prioritise patients based on characteristics, such as age, sex, and HIV status. The formulation of HBP on PS was designed to prioritise services based on type, such as maternal and child health. Each formulation of the HBP was modelled as a statement of the priority that is placed on a particular service or group of patients, as described above. The formulation HBP based on LCO achieved the largest reduction in disability-adjusted life years ( DALs ) between 202 and 204 compared to the benchmark scenario, by concentrating on high-impact interventions. However, this formulation incurred a excess DALs in the first years of its implementation. The formulation HBP based on PC achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark on a year-by-year basis, and a reduction in DALs over the whole period, suggesting that prioritisation based on patient characteristics might be beneficial in the future. The formulation HBP on PS did not perform as well as the other two, but still achieved a reduction in DALs over the period compared to the benchmark.

    Title: 
    Article: Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species. Yet, the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species. Here, we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, which diverged from P. interpunctella over 100 million years ago. We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. Additionally, both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I. Surprisingly, in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Additionally, sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species. Instead, four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I. Despite this, we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology. 
 Chromosome segregation is an essential part of cell division in both somatic and germline tissues. In the specialized meiotic cell divisions in the germline, chromosomes undergo an intricate multi-step alignment process before chromosome segregation can occur. First, chromosomes become more linear, then homologous chromosomes ( maternal and paternal copies of the same chromosome ) find each other and pair from end-to-end. This end-to-end pairing allows for crossover recombination and the formation of chiasmata, which link homologous chromosomes together. These linkages assist in the proper bi-orientation of homologs on the metaphase I spindle, where homologous kinetochores must face opposite spindle poles for accurate chromosome segregation. Each of these steps needs to be executed accurately to avoid chromosome segregation defects during meiosis such as nondisjunction. Even though the processes that occur during early meiosis are largely conserved ( homolog pairing, recombination, and segregation ), researchers have found that different molecular mechanisms mediate these processes in different species. For example, in both male and female meiosis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, centromeres and pericentric heterochromatin have been implicated in early meiotic pairing events at ( or even before ) meiotic entry [1–8], and centromeres also mediate chromosome segregation at metaphase I ( reviewed in [6, 9] ). In Caenorhabditis elegans, chromosome-specific sequences and their cis-acting binding partners form “pairing centers” at the distal regions of chromosomes ( arm-like regions ) that facilitate homolog recognition [10–14], and chromosome segregation is mediated through a mechanism where telomeres face the spindle poles and kinetochore cups form around the chromosomes ( reviewed in [15, 16] ). Despite these findings, how homologs find each other in three-dimensional nuclear space and distinguish between homologous partners and heterologous chromosomes is unclear in most other species. Additionally, the mechanisms mediating chromosome bi-orientation and segregation during meiosis I are still not well understood, specifically in holocentric species ( where kinetochores form all along the length of the chromosome during mitosis ). Holocentric species, like moths and C. elegans, face distinct challenges during meiosis compared to mitosis [17, 18]. Since recombination is typically suppressed in centromere-proximal regions of chromosomes across species [19–21], it is reasonable to predict that maintaining the holocentric structure during meiosis could largely inhibit recombination. Additionally, centromeres must be bi-orientated on the metaphase plate during both meiosis I and meiosis II for the proper segregation of chromosomes [22, 23]. If recombination does occur and results in a cruciform-shaped bivalent ( a cross-shaped structure with long and short arms perpendicular to each other ), having centromeres all along the length of the chromosome would mean centromeres face many different directions, which could lead to failed bi-orientation [17]. Therefore, holocentric species must evolve mechanisms of chromosome segregation during meiosis that are distinct from those used during mitosis. Three meiosis-specific mechanisms have been identified to date in holocentric species: 1 ) inverted meiosis, where sister chromatids are segregated before homologs and the holocentric structure is at least partially maintained [24–27], 2 ) telokinetic ( or telokinetic-like ) meiosis, where telomeres or distal chromosome regions become kinetochore-recruitment sites [28, 29], and 3 ) chromosome restructuring as seen in C. elegans, where telomeres face the spindle pole and kinetochore cups form around chromosomes [16, 29–34]. Our previous work in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, suggested that gene-rich chromosome domains near telomeres facilitate homolog recognition and that telomeres face the spindle poles for chromosome segregation in the male germline [35]. However, whether these findings apply to all Lepidopteran insects ( of which there are almost 200, 000 spanning more than 120 million years of evolution ) is unknown. Here, we employ a combination of Oligopaint DNA FISH and immunofluorescence to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella and compare our findings to new and previous work in Bombyx. Plodia is a promising new laboratory model for genetics and genomics in Lepidoptera. While Bombyx have been used for decades as a model Lepidopteran system, creating transgenic Bombyx is extremely challenging and the feeding and space demands of rearing these large insects make them sub-optimal for laboratory research. Plodia, on the other hand, are small, their embryos are easy to inject, and several recent studies have demonstrated high success in creating transgenic strains using CRISPR and PiggyBac technologies [36, 37]. Our studies here demonstrate the suitably of using Plodia as a model system for studying both conserved and divergent aspects of meiotic chromosome biology. Using Oligopaints to label multiple domains along individual chromosomes in Plodia larval testes, we find that pairing in Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to Bombyx. Additionally, both Bombyx and Plodia form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, while Bombyx bivalents always have telomeres oriented toward spindle poles at metaphase I in spermatogenesis, we find that Plodia bivalents can be either “telomere-oriented” ( telomeres facing spindle poles ) or “center-oriented” ( chromosome centers facing spindle poles ). Intriguingly, we find that both Plodia and Bombyx form kinetochores at non-telomeric loci towards chromosome centers, even when telomeres are oriented toward spindle poles. We term this “center-kinetic” chromosome segregation. These central kinetochores do not seem to pair between sister chromatids, resulting in metaphase I structures with four distinct kinetochore foci. Despite the spacing between kinetochores, we observe clear co-orientation mediated by end-on microtubule attachments. This mode of chromosome segregation appears to be a completely distinct mechanism from that employed by these moths during mitosis, where they are holocentric, and it is distinct from other previously described mechanisms of meiotic segregation in holocentric species. Together, our studies reveal that unique mechanisms dictate chromosome segregation dynamics in Lepidopteran spermatogenesis. 
 To visualize Plodia chromosomes during meiosis, we designed and generated Oligopaint libraries targeting five of the 30 Plodia autosomes. Since our previous studies in Bombyx suggested chromosome size and gene distribution might influence meiotic chromosome dynamics, we designed probes targeting three large, one medium, and one small Plodia chromosome, with varying distributions of genes across the chromosomes ( ch5, 11, 15, 19, and 27; Fig 1A ). Our paint design here focused on creating a three-stripe pattern across these chromosomes, with probes labeling the single-copy sequences in both distal arm-like regions ( designated Arm1 or Arm2 probes–hereafter referred to as “arms” ) and the middle of the central region ( Center probe, Fig 1A ). This allowed us to not only visualize single chromosomes as they progress through meiosis but also to analyze the dynamics of specific sub-chromosomal domains as previously described [35]. The genome we originally used to design the ch5, 19, and 27 paints was in a draft state ( assembled into large, chromosome size scaffolds with many unmapped contigs. However, we were able to map these probes to the correct chromosomes using a combination of bioinformatic and cytogenetic analysis. The probes for ch11 and 15 were designed based on a high-quality genome assembly of these chromosomes [38, 39]. We found that all probes were specific to their target chromosomes and did not cross-hybridize with other Plodia chromosomes ( Supplemental Fig S1 ). Using Oligaint FISH and immunofluorescence, we observed that in Plodia spermatogenesis initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to Bomx ( Fig 2A–C ). This is consistent with previous findings that gene-rich regions are involved in homolog recognition [40, 41]. At metaphase I, we observed rod-shaped bivalents in both Plodia and Bomx ( Fig 2D–F ). However, while Bomx bival have telomeres oriented toward spindle poles, Plodia bival can be either telom-oriented ( Fig 2E ) or center-oriented ( Fig 2F ). In both species, kinchores assemble at non-telom loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of telomeres orientation ( Fig 2G–I ). Sister kincho do not seem to pair in these species, resulting in metaphase structures with four distinct kincho foci ( Fig 2J–L ). Despite spacing between kinchores, we find clear end-on microtule attachments mediating co-orientation ( Fig 2M–O ). This mode of chromosome segregation is distinct from previously described meiotic mechanisms in holoc species. We term this “center-kinetic” chromosome segregation. Our studies demonstrate that Plodia is a suitable model for studying conserved and divergent aspects of meiotic chromosome biology and highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems. The findings here challenge the classical view that paired pole-facing kinchores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis.

    Title: 
    Article: The median eminence ( ME ), located at the base of the hypothalamus, is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary. We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, and this is likely of hypothalamic origin. We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. In parallel, ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, which is known to affect NG2-glia, or changes in gut microbiota, rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals. 
 The hypothalamus is a crucial regulator of homeostasis and energy balance in vertebrates. It centralizes information from other regions of the brain and from the periphery, while an important part of its function is to regulate the secretion of pituitary hormones. These control essential functions, including post-natal growth, puberty, pregnancy, fertility, lactation, stress and energy homeostasis. Consequently, pituitary hormone deficiencies ( hypopituitarism ) are associated with significant morbidity. The murine pituitary gland, which is located under the hypothalamus, has three compartments: the anterior pituitary lobe ( AL ), containing five different endocrine cell types, the intermediate ( IL ) with one ( melanotrophs ), and the posterior pituitary, composed of glial cells and hypothalamic axonal termini. The hypothalamus connects to the pituitary via the pituitary stalk, which itself contains neuronal, glial, and vascular components. AL endocrine cells are regulated by neurohormones secreted by different hypothalamic neurons into a bed of fenestrated capillaries located at the base of the third ventricle, in a structure called the median eminence ( ME ). These neurohormones are delivered to the anterior pituitary by the hypophyseal portal system. Conversely, for the posterior pituitary, neurohormones ( oxytocin and vasopressin ) are released directly from hypothalamic axons that reach the gland itself [1]. The ME, which is located outside the blood-brain barrier [2], and the pituitary stalk are crucial components of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, as flow of information in and out of the hypothalamus is respectively collected and conveyed through these structures. In addition to the blood vessels, several cell types, including glial cells and microglia, are found in the ME ( for review see [2, 3] ). NG2-glia, or oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs ), are present in ME [4–6]. They are the most proliferative cells within the central nervous system ( CNS ) and their canonical function is to generate oligodendrocytes, although rarely astrocytes and neurons in some contexts. However, they also fulfil other roles, such as interacting with and modulating the function of neighbouring neurons, astrocytes or microglia ( for review see [7] ). Within the ME, NG2-glia have been shown to generate oligodendrocytes [5, 6], some of which are in close contact with the dendrites of leptin receptor expressing neurons. The relevance of these interactions is revealed by ablation of ME NG2-glia which results in the degeneration of these dendrites, leading to increased body weight [4]. Furthermore, refeeding after an overnight fast induces a rapid proliferation and differentiation of ME NG2-glia [6], demonstrating that nutrition influences, and is influenced by, ME NG2-glia. Another category of glial cells, the tanycytes, of which there are several types [8], are flanking the base of the third ventricle. Because the ME is located outside the blood-brain barrier, tanycytes are exposed to both the systemic circulation and the cerebro-spinal fluid [9]. They regulate neurohormone secretion from hypothalamic axon terminals [10–12] and modulate the release of blood-borne peripheral information to the hypothalamus ( [13] and for review see [14] ). Furthermore, they comprise a population of hypothalamic stem cells ( SCs ) ( for review see [2, 15] ). Similarly to other CNS stem cell populations, tanycytes express the HMG-box transcription factor SOX2 [16–20], required for maintenance of several different adult stem cell populations ( for review see [21] ). In embryonic neural progenitors, SOX2 is often co-expressed with the two other SOXB1 members, SOX1 and SOX3 [22]. Upon cell differentiation, either in embryonic or adult contexts, expression of Soxb1 genes, tends to be downregulated [23]. There are exceptions, however. For example, SOX2 and SOX3 are maintained in spinal cord oligodendrocyte precursors, where they are required for their subsequent differentiation [24]. In both humans and mice, mutations in SOX3/Sox3, which is located on the X chromosome, are associated with hypopituitarism ( for review see [25] ). In mice, we showed that SOX3 is largely absent from the pituitary, but it is found in the developing and mature hypothalamus, being particularly highly expressed in the embryonic infundibulum and later maintained in the ME ( [26] and this study ). Here, we aimed to characterise the role of SOX3 in the hypothalamus and the etiology of the hypopituitarism. Using conditional gene deletion, we show that loss of Sox3 in the central nervous system ( CNS ) is sufficient to cause hypopituitarism and that this develops postnatally, at the time of weaning. Consequently, we observe in the pituitary a defective maturation of endocrine cells. SOX3 is expressed in hypothalamic stem cells and its deletion affects their proliferation in vivo and in hypothalamic neurosphere assays. SOX3 is also expressed in NG2-glia in the ME, and both their proliferation and differentiation are reduced in Sox3 mutants. Furthermore, we observe a striking deficiency in myelination of axons in the ME. Importantly, the appearance of all these defects correlates with development of hypopituitarism suggesting that SOX3 is required postnatally for the functional maturation of the ME. Building on previous work demonstrating the efficacy of aspirin in inducing proliferation and/or differentiation of NG2-glia [27, 28], we treated Sox3 mutants with low dose aspirin. We observed a restoration of NG2-glia proliferation, and a rescue of pituitary hormonal deficiencies, but not a rescue of myelination. We also found that changes in the gut microbiome ameliorate the hypopituitarism. Our study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation, and that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors. 
 SOX3 is widely expressed in the developing CNS [22], but it is also retained within some brain regions postnatally, notably the hypothalamus [26], where its expression is found in tanycytic neural stem cells ( NSCs ) and several differentiated cell types [29]. In contrast, we only observed SOX3 in rare cells within the pituitary representing a very small subset of lactotrophs ( S1A Fig ). Therefore, the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3 mutants is likely to be of hypothalamic origin. To test this hypothesis, we used Nestin-Cre [30] and Pou1f1-Cre [31] to delete Sox3 in the CNS and the pituitary respectively. Pituitary hormonal contents were then measured by radio immunoassay ( RIA ) in two-month-old males ( Fig 1A ). While Nestin-Cre animals display a modest but significant reduction in growth hormone ( GH ) levels, as we previously reported [32], we observed a significant reduction of GH contents in Nestin-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice compared to both Nestin-Cre and Sox3floxGFP/Y controls. This 75% reduction in Nestin-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice is comparable to that measured in Sox3-/Y mutant males ( Fig 1A, [26] ). In contrast, in Pou1f1-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice, neither GH ( Fig 1A ) nor Prolactin ( PRL ) ( S1B Fig ) contents are affected. These data are therefore in agreement with a CNS origin of the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3-/Y animals. To avoid undesirable effects originating from Sox deletion in the pituitary, we used a tamoxifen inducible system to delete Sox3 in the CNS [33]. Tamoxifen treated Nest-C; SoxfG mice display a significant reduction in GH ( Fig 2A ) and PRL ( S Fig 2B ) levels. In contrast, tamox treated Pou1-C; SoxG mice show no change in GH ( Fig 2 ) or PRL ( S Fig 2 ) levels. These results confirm that Sox3 is required in the CNS for the development of hypopuitarism. Next, we investigated the role of Sox in hypothamic stem cells. Sox is expressed in tanytic stem cells ( SCs ) [16–20], which give rise to several cell types [34]. We used a tamox inducible system to delete Sox in these cells [35]. Tamox treated tan-C Sox mice display a significant reduction in GH ( Fig 2 ) and PRL ( Fig 2 ) levels. In contrast, tam treated tan-C mice show no change in GH ( Fig ) or PRL ( Fig ) levels. These data indicate that Sox is required in tanytic stem cells for the development of hypopitism. Sox is also expressed in NG-glia in the ME [4–6], which generate oligodrocytes [5, 6]. We used a tamox inducible system to delete Sox in NG-g [36]. Tamox treated NG-g mice display a significant reduction in GH ( Fig 2 ) and PRL ( Fig ) levels. In contrast, tam treated NG-g show no change GH ( Fig ) or P ( Fig ) levels. These results indicate that Sox is required in NG-g for the development of hypitism. We also observed a striking deficiency in myination of axons in the ME in Sox mutants ( Fig 3 ), which is consistent with the role of NG-g in generating oligodcytes [5, 6]. Importantly, the appearance of all these defects correlates with the development of hypitism suggesting that Sox is required postnat for the maturation of the ME. Building on previous work demonstrating the efficacy of aspir in inducing proliferation and/or differentiation NG-g [27, 28], we treated Sox mutants with low dose aspir. We observed restoration of NG-g proliferation ( Fig 4 ) and rescue of pituit hormonal deficiencies ( Fig 4 ) but not rescue of myination ( Fig 4. We also found that changes in the microbiome ameliorate hypitism. Our study highlights a novel role for NG-g in postnatal formation of functional ME and control pituration and an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss Sox in these cells can be modified by non-gen factors.

    Title: 
    Article: Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis. Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important, since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer. Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin. However, we need to identify the GEF, or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor, that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/CED-12, is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 to promote cell movements that result in the engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis, and a later cell migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell. It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation. Therefore, we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations, and got a contradictory result. CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations, since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations. However, CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis, the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF. To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin, during corpse engulfment and cell migration, we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions. A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region. Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function, and not the corpse engulfment function. We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10. Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis, resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases. Thus, we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases, by using distinct domains, to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation. 
 Organized F-actin is required for cell migrations, and for engulfment of dying cells and cellular debris. The idea that the processes of cell migration and cell/corpse or debris engulfment use related actin regulators has been proposed for processes like macrophage migration and engulfment in Drosophila [1]. The idea that embryonic cell migrations and cell corpse engulfment are linked in C. elegans was suggested when we reported that loss of the Arp2/3 regulators, gex-2 and gex-3, resulted in both long-lived corpses and epidermal migration defects, similar to loss of Rac1/ced-10 [2]. These studies raised the question of how actin is regulated during two apparently distinct processes, epidermal enclosure, a collective cell migration by the epidermal cells to engulf the entire embryo, and corpse engulfment, where part of the membrane of individual cells reorganizes to engulf their dying neighbors. Epiboly, the process that creates the metazoan body plan, depends on regulated sheet migrations. In C. elegans, epiboly begins at the 400-cell stage, when the main embryonic tissues begin to differentiate, and the epidermis begins its complex migrations ( Fig 1A ). An open question in all organisms, is how signals are coordinated in tissues to promote the correctly oriented movements. By focusing on the first movements of the epidermal cell sheet, ventral enclosure and dorsal intercalation, we have identified a pathway that promotes polarized enrichment of branched actin: the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 activates the WAVE/Scar complex, a nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) for Arp2/3. Our studies identified signals that localize CED-10 and WVE-1 correctly at membranes, to direct F-actin enrichment [3]. However, how these membrane signals are communicated to the CED-10 GTPase during epiboly is not understood. Mutations in CED-10/Rac1 were first identified for their role in cell corpse engulfment [4]. The original ced-10 alleles were hypomorphic alleles that interfered with the ability of cells to engulf dying cells [4, 5]. Identifying null alleles of ced-10 revealed a second role for CED-10: promoting embryonic morphogenesis [6, 2]. CED-10 was proposed to recruit and activate the WAVE complex, which in C. elegans is essential for embryonic organ tissue formation and tissue migrations [2, 7]. GTPases are proposed to be recruited and activated at membranes by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, GEFs, that enhance the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus activating the GTPase ( Reviewed in [8, 9] ). The GEF for CED-10 during corpse engulfment was proposed to be CED-5/DOCK180 [5] CED-5 was also proposed to act as the GEF for CED-10 during neuronal migrations [10]. However, the CED-10 GEF or GEFs that promote embryonic epidermal movements are not known. CED-5/DOCK180 is a DOCK GEF which requires an ELMO protein to activate Rac [11]. In C. elegans, CED-5/DOCK180 works with CED-12/ELMO to activate CED-10 during corpse clearance ( Proposed by [12]; [13–17] ). During corpse engulfment CED-5/CED-12 and CED-10 are proposed to act in neighboring cells, to enclose dying cells, by promoting F-actin polymerization in membrane protrusions that encircle dying cells. F-actin was shown to enrich around dying cells in the germline and embryos [18, 19], and then disappear as the corpse decayed. While some studies noted that CED-12 appears to have an embryonic role [13], the role of CED-5 and CED-12 during embryonic development, and epidermal morphogenesis has not been investigated. We present here analysis of the role of CED-5/DOCK and CED-12/ELMO, during epidermal morphogenesis, that shows these cell death regulators also support epidermal migrations. We therefore investigated if CED-5/CED-12, a candidate GEF for CED-10’s ventral enclosure function, shares epidermal ced-10 phenotypes. While loss of the candidate GEF, CED-5/CED-12 reduced F-actin around corpses, as expected, loss of CED-5/CED-12 increased F-actin in epidermal cells during ventral enclosure, the opposite phenotype as loss of CED-10. To determine how a GEF can both promote and inhibit F-actin formation, we investigated if this candidate CED-10/Rac1 GEF also functions as a RhoGAP. A candidate GAP domain was identified in CED-12 and mutated. Loss of the GAP function of CED-12 resembled loss of CED-12 for epidermal migrations, but corpse engulfment was normal. These studies identify a previously undescribed role during embryonic morphogenesis for CED-5 and CED-12, proteins well-studied for their cell corpse engulfment. Analysis of a mutation in the newly identified GAP domain of CED-12 suggest CED-12/ELMO, uses different subdomains to switch from promoting to inhibiting F-actin formation, depending on the subcellular context. Two likely GTPase targets of the CED-5/CED-12 epidermal morphogenesis function are identified, placing DOCK/ELMO at a central position for actin regulation during morphogenesis. 
 CED-5/DOCK-180 and CED-12/ELMO act as a bipartite GEF that promotes active CED-10/Rac1 during the engulfment of cells that die by programmed cell death in C. elegans [13–17]. We showed that CED-10/Rac1 also acts to promote the tissue migration known as ventral enclosure that leads the epidermis to enclose the developing C. elegans embryo [2] ( Fig 1A ). However, the GEF for CED-10/Rac1 during this process is not known. To test if CED-5 and CED-12 are required during embryonic epidermal cell migrations, we crossed null or strong loss of function alleles of ced-5 ( n1812 ) [20] and ced-12 ( n3261 ) [17] into a strain that expresses F-actin only in the epidermis ( lin-26p:: Lifeact::mCherry, Fig 1B, strains are listed in the Methods ) [21]. Loss of ced-5 and ced-12 resulted in embryos that died due to failed epidermal migration ( Fig 2A, B ), indicating that C-5 and C-12 are required for epider cell migration. However, loss of c-5 and c-12 resulted in reduced F-act in the epider ( Fig 2C ), opposite to what was expected for C-10 GEF. To determine how C-12 can have opposing effects on F-act, we investigated if C-12 harbors a GAP function. A candidate region in C- away from the C- GEF catalytic region was identified. Mutating the catalytic Arg in C- (R537 ) altered epider cell function and not corpse function. Interfering with GEF function by muting C- ability to bind Rac1 C- resulted in loss of ventral enclosure and corpsement. Mutating Ser-Arg in C predicted to bind and stabilize Rac for catalysis resulted in loss of both ventral and corpsement Genetic studies support that GAP likely acts on Gases. Thus, we propose C- and C-12 support cycling of multiple Gases by distinct domains to promote and inhibit F-act nucleation.

    Title: 
    Article: A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms ( e. g., recurrent coupling or adaptation ), but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis. Here, we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. 
 The brain has the ability to seamlessly process and integrate information on vastly different timescales. In primates, past work suggested that this may be supported by two essential features of neocortex: the highly recurrent architecture of cortical networks [1], and an organization of different cortical areas into a temporal processing hierarchy [2–4]. It was found that early sensory areas specialize on fast processing of sensory inputs [5–7], whereas higher ( transmodal ) areas perform temporal processing with long timescales—combining new information with past information that is maintained over extended periods [8, 9]. This hierarchy is reflected by an increase in the intrinsic timescale of neural activity, as measured by the decay rate of autocorrelation [4, 10–12]. In addition, intrinsic timescales were found to be indicative of the specialization for behaviorally relevant computations [13–16]. Finally, there exist gradients in intra-areal properties across the anatomical cortical hierarchy, all of which point to a stronger recurrent coupling for areas specialized on long timescales [17, 18]. In particular, higher cortical areas have an increased dendritic spine density for pyramidal neurons [1, 19], overall excitation-inhibition ratio [20], the expression of related receptor genes [10, 21], gray matter myelination [10, 22], and the strength of functional connectivity [11, 14, 23, 24]. From modelling studies, a stronger recurrence is known to enable stronger and longer-lasting activity fluctuations [15, 25–27], consistent with the increase in timescales for higher areas. Overall, this led to the understanding that in primates, temporal processing is organized hierarchically [3], and that specializations along this hierarchy are likely governed by differences in recurrent coupling [27, 28]. Yet, it is still open how a temporal hierarchy shaped by recurrence fulfills requirements of neural coding and information processing, and whether it manifests as a general organization principle in mammals. Here, we investigate mouse visual cortex because it comprises an anatomical and functional sensory processing hierarchy that differs from primate visual cortex in many interesting ways [29]. Visual cortex in mice exhibits clear hierarchical feedforward–feedback projection patterns [30], which are paralleled by differences in the recruitment of inhibitory and excitatory neurons [31], and a functional hierarchy that follows the anatomical hierarchy [32]. In addition, the rodent analog of the ventral stream shows a hierarchy of temporal scales where higher areas encode visual information more persistently [33]. Finally, population codes vary between association and sensory cortices [34], and impairments to cortical frontal ( transmodal ) areas have a greater impact on evidence accumulation over long timescales than posterior ( sensory ) areas, which also exhibit shorter activity timescales during evidence accumulation [35]. Thus, the mouse visual cortex also shows many signatures of hierarchical temporal processing. However, the mouse visual cortex was found to differ substantially from primate cortical organization. First, the sensory processing hierarchy seems to be more shallow [36–38], with overall fewer and more primitive higher areas [39], and multisensory integration at a relatively early stage in processing compared to primates [40]. Second, although there exists evidence for gradients in interneuron numbers and intra-cortical connectivity from sensory to transmodal areas [41], the degree of interareal variation of microstructural properties in mice [42, 43] is far less pronounced than in the highly differentiated primate cortex [44–47]. This raises the question whether a temporal hierarchy shaped by recurrence also characterizes mice, or whether the strong focus on sensory processing in a more shallow hierarchy requires a different, coding-optimized organization altogether. To address this question, it is important to note that a coding perspective entails a similar trade-off as the temporal-processing perspective ( long integration vs. fast relay ) : In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, robust coding requires integrating information over time [48], whereas, for low noise, efficient coding of sensory information requires temporal decorrelation to reduce redundancies [49–51]. This trade-off can be characterized using the predictability R, which quantifies the proportion of information in current neural spiking that can be predicted from the recent past [52]. This predictable information reflects temporal redundancy, and facilitates, for instance, active information storage ( maintaining past input to combine it with present input [53–55] ) and associative learning [56]. In addition, the closely related information timescale τR gives the timescale over which past information has to be integrated for prediction [52]. Together, predictability and information timescales provide a broad view into the neural code, quantifying both, the amount and the timescale of redundancy in neural spiking. Here, we will use the information timescale, as well as a correlation timescale, to probe for hierarchical temporal processing in mouse visual cortex. Moreover, we will test whether higher cortical areas show an increase in predictability, in line with robust coding, or a decrease in predictability, in line with efficient coding. Finally, we will compare results between spontaneous activity and natural stimuli, which is important to distinguish between stimulus-induced and intrinsically generated timescales and predictability. Together, these results will clarify whether mouse visual cortex shows signatures of hierarchical temporal processing, and whether these are stimulus-induced, indicating a stronger role of feedforward processing, or rather intrinsically generated, indicating a stronger role of recurrent processing. 
 To analyze signatures of temporal processing in the recorded spike trains, we quantify single neuron autocorrelation and predictability ( Materials and methods ). Autocorrelation C ( T ) considers only the linear dependence to a single point in time with time lag T ( Fig 1A ). In contrast, predictability R ( T ) gives the proportion of spiking information R ( T ) that can be predicted from past spiking in an entire past range T ( Fig 1B ), and thus captures all linear and nonlinear dependencies in that range T [52]. Using the autocorrelation, we estimate the correlation timescale of spiking activity, which is computed as the decay time τC of an exponentially decaying autocorrelation ( Fig 1A, Materials and methods ). It is important to note that the resulting correlation timescale captures temporal correlations from both, intrinsic neural mechanisms and visual stimuli. One way to disentangle these contributions is to work with trial-based data where mean non-stationary inputs can be estimated and removed [4, 33, 60], which gives rise to the so-called intrinsic timescale [4]. Here, we instead compute the correlation timescale for ongoing activity in an entire stimulus block to obtain clean estimates on the single-neuron level. We then systematically compare the estimated timescale under stimulation with a natural movie with the one obtained for spontaneous activity, where the latter reflects the intrinsic timescale [61]. In contrast to the autocorrelation C ( T ), the predictability R ( T ) increases monotonously with T, because more past information can only increase predictability. From this, we estimate ( i ) the total predictability Rtot of a unit as the value where R ( T ) saturates for large T, as well as ( ii ) the information timescale τR, which can be interpreted as a rise time of the predictability, and indicates a typical timescale on which past activity is informative, i. e. adds to the predictability of current spiking ( Fig 1B ). Similar to the correlation timescale, the predictability and information timescale reflect both stimulus-induced and intrinsic effects, and thus will be systematically compared between stimulus conditions. In the data, we found that single unit autocorrelation is generally well approximated by an exponentially decaying function ( Fig 1E and S9 Fig ), except for very short time lags, which we accounted for in our fitting procedure ( Materials and methods ). Moreover, units with higher correlation timescale typically also have higher information timescale ( S2 Fig ), indicating that the different measures of timescale capture a similar trend in the data. Consistent with previous findings [52], τR is smaller than τC, because R ( T ) only increases for non-redundant past information, i. e. information that could not be read out from a smaller past range T. In contrast, the autocorrelation C ( T ) only considers time-lagged bins, and hence also incorporates redundant contributions [52]. To provide a better intuition of the above measures, we can relate them to simpler statistics of single neuron spiking ( S3 Fig ). For instance, the autocorrelation C ( 0 ) is equivalent to the variance of spiking, whereas the predictability R ( 0 ) is equivalent to the entropy of spiking [52]. In addition, the timescale τC is related to the autocovariance of spiking [62] and the timescale τR is related to the conditional entropy of spiking [52]. In summary, the autocorrelation and predictability capture different aspects of single-neuron spiking : autocorrelation measures temporal correlations, whereas predict measures the proportion of information in spiking that can be predicted from past spiking. We now turn to the analysis of timescales and predictability in the visual hierarchy of the mouse cortex. First, we find that timescales of spiking increase along the anatomical hierarchy ( Fig 2A ), whereas predictability decreases ( Fig 2B ). This is consistent with the idea that higher areas integrate information over longer times, whereas lower areas process information more quickly. In contrast, intrinsic times of spontaneous activity display a similar hierarchy ( Fig 2C ) whereas predictability is stimulus-dependent ( Fig 2 D ). This indicates that intrinsic timescales are not driven by stimulus, but rather by intrinsic properties of the neural circuit. Moreover, we find that timescales and predictability can be reproduced in a basic recurrent network with correlated sensory input ( Fig 3 ). This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. In conclusion, our results show that the mouse visual cortex exhibits signatures of temporal processing and that are stimulus-induced, indicating a stronger role of feedforward processing, rather than intrinsically generated, indicating a stronger of recurrent processing. This is in contrast to the primate cortex where temporal is organized hierarchically and governed by recurrent. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system uses intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for efficient neural code. 
The article discusses the processing of information across different timescales in the brain, specifically in the rodent visual system. The authors use information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis to show that information and timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Intrinsic times for spontaneous activity display a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability is stimulus-dependent. They reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network with sensory input. The findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predict for an efficient neural code. The brain has the ability to process and integrate information on vastly different times. In primates, work suggested this may be supported by two features of neocortex: highly recurrent architecture and organization of cortical areas into temporal hierarchy. Early areas specialize fast processing sensory inputs, while higher (trans) perform processing long timescales combining new with information over extended. This is reflected in intrinsic times of activity, measured by decay autocorrelation. Intrinsic times are indicative of behaviorally computations. Gradients in intra-are properties across hierarchy point to stronger coupling for specialized long. Higher areas have increased dendritic density, excitation-inhibition ratio, receptor expression, myination, and strength connectivity. Modelling shows stronger recurrence enables longer activity, consistent with increase times for higher. This led to understanding in prim, temporal is organized hierarchically and specializations governed by differences. Yet, open how hierarchy by recurrence fulfills requirements coding and processing, and manifests general principle in mammals. The authors investigate mouse cortex because it differs from primate in many ways. Visual cortex exhibits hierarchical feedforward-feedback patterns, recruitment inhibitory-excitatory neurons, and functional hierarchy follows anatomical. The ventral stream shows hierarchy temporal where higher encode more persist. Population vary association-sensory cortices and impair frontal-trans areas have greater impact over

    Title: 
    Article: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation. 
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) can non-invasively activate superficial cortical regions to study brain functions, treat psychiatric and neurological disorders, and collect diagnostic biomarkers [1]. However, improving methodologies and developing new applications remain slow and challenging due to the uncertainties about what is activated by TMS and how this activation courses through the circuits within and beyond the stimulated region [2]. One approach to understanding these network effects in the motor cortex is via descending volleys of activity that propagate to the spinal cord in response to TMS and can be recorded epidurally as transient corticospinal waves ( Fig 1 ). The corticospinal waves represent the activity of layer 5b pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) that send axons into the spinal cord [3]. The shortest latency direct wave ( D-wave ) is widely agreed to represent the direct activation of PTNs [4]. Subsequent waves are called indirect waves ( I-waves ) and likely represent transsynaptic activations of PTNs resulting from the initial direct activation of PTNS, axons of afferents, and other neuron types. Understanding the neurons and circuits that produce the I-waves would provide insight into patterns of neuron activation and the circuit connections that mediate the cortical response to TMS [5]. Current understanding of I-waves arises from epidural recordings combined with pharmacological interventions that identified the synaptic receptors involved in I-wave generation and broadly suggested excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to I-waves [5, 6]. These and other experimental findings were organized into conceptual frameworks to propose mechanisms that give rise to the corticospinal waves [5, 6]. Two broad categories of these frameworks are I-wave generation through circuit activations and I-wave generation via intrinsic neuronal mechanisms ( neural oscillator hypothesis ). With circuit activation, corticocortical afferents are thought to initiate activations in different neuronal populations that propagate through the cortical circuit to L5 PTNs. Intrinsic neuronal mechanisms have also been hypothesized to allow L5 PTNs to behave as neural oscillators such that the I-waves result from repeated spiking from the same neuron due to the dynamics following initial excitation by TMS. Computational neuronal network models have been developed that integrate anatomical and electrophysiological details to investigate TMS-induced corticospinal waves. A model by Esser et al. represented the major layers of motor cortex using spiking point neurons and homogeneous activation of a proportion of fiber terminals across all layers to represent activation by single TMS pulses [7]. Rusu et al. developed a network model of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons with realistic dendritic morphologies to investigate the effect of somatodendritic conduction and integration on I-wave generation [8]. These models generated I-wave activity that qualitatively resembled experimental findings. However, the models were not directly constrained by experimental recordings and lacked an exhaustive sensitivity analysis to investigate, among other variables, the effects of inhomogeneous activation across different neuron types. To determine the TMS activations and neuron-to-neuron projections that contribute to I-waves, we used experimental recordings of the corticospinal response to TMS to provide objectives to optimize a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn. Starting from a reduced version of the Esser model, that could produce I-waves and is mathematically compact, we established a spiking neuronal network model of motor cortex that reproduced the features of D-waves and I-waves recorded epidurally in the cervical spine of human subjects. Next, a unified model was developed that generated responses with and without a D-wave with a change in a single parameter. A sensitivity analysis of the unified model was conducted using the two-variable-at-a-time ( TVAT ) method. Finally, machine learning and graph theoretical measures were used to relate the connectivity of the model to the results of TVAT analysis and identify general mechanisms producing I-waves at the circuit level. A high-level representation of the methodology is summarized in Fig 2. 
 Particle swarm optimization was used to identify parameters for a model capable of responding with a D-wave ( D+ ) or without a D-wave ( D- ). The objective functions included the firing rate of the network prior to stimulation ( i. e., no stimulation ) and several properties of the corticospinal response after stimulation ( see Methods for a detailed description of the experimental data ) including the timings and amplitudes of the peaks and troughs. The parameters being optimized included the synaptic weights of each projection, the proportion of neurons activated by TMS, the conduction velocities for each neuron type, and the propagation delay due to stimulation of afferents. The total number of optimized parameters was 98, and the total list of parameters and their optimization ranges are described in Methods. The final selected model had average corticospinal wave errors of 18. 8% and 24. 0% for the D+ and D− responses, respectively ( Fig 4 ). The corticospinal tract activity generated by the individually optimized models captured many of the features of the experimental data ( Fig 4A ). The spiking responses of the models are represented using raster plots in Fig 4B. The final parameter values for each of the optimized models are presented in Figs A-C in S1 Appendix. Due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space ( 98 parameters ), total grid search, random, or quasi-random sampling would require a prohibitively large number of simulations to characterize fully the relationships between the parameters and the corticospinal response. To reduce the computational cost, a two-variable-at-a-time ( TVAT ) sensitivity analysis was conducted. TVAT is a form of fixed-point analysis that varies two parameters simultaneously in a grid-search with the remaining parameters fixed at their original values. TVAT analysis is more computationally intensive than the widely used one-variable-at-a-time method, but allows characterization of pairwise interactions between variables [11, 12]. TVAT analysis was performed using direct activation parameters and synaptic weights. All unique parameter pairs were varied in a grid search spanning the entire parameter range used in the optimization. The amplitudes of the simulated corticospinal waves were measured to construct amplitude maps as a function of the parameter pair involved, and polynomial regressions were used to characterize the amplitude maps. The total effect sizes, computed as the sum of effect sizes across all corticospinal waves, for the 20 most influential parameters are shown in Fig 5. For activation effects, activation of L5 PTNs ( TMS-L5 PTN ) had the largest effect size followed by activation of afferents to L5 PTN ( TMS-L5 PTN AFF ) and activation of L2/3 ITs ( TMS-L2/3 IT ). This is followed by activations of L6 BCs and ITs ( TMS-L6 BC and TMS-L6 IT ). Important projections included the L5 PTN-L2/3 IT, L2/3 BC-L2/3 IT, L5 PTN-L5 PTN, L2/3 IT-L5 PTN, and L5 BC-L5 PTN. All effect sizes are shown in Fig F in S1 Appendix. The effect sizes of the parameters on each individual corticospinal wave relative to the total are summarized in Fig 5B. This plot reveals that while activation of L5 PTNs substantially affected D-waves, this parameter made minimal contributions to I-waves. The activation of afferents to L5 PTNs, L2/3 IT, and L6 IT most substantially affected the I1-wave. This analysis led to a subsequent grouping of parameters that preferentially influenced a single corticospinal wave versus parameters that affected multiple corticinal waves ( Fig 6 ). Parameters that preferentially affected single corticinal waves included activation of L PTNs, activation of affer to L PT, and conduction of L PT. Parameters that affected multiple cortic waves included activation of affer to L PT, activation of L/3 IT and L6, and conduction of affer to L PT and L/3. The results of the TV analysis were used to train a machine learning model to predict the corticosp response based on the connectivity of the model. The model was trained on the data from the TV analysis and tested on unseen data. The model was able to predict the cortic response with an accuracy of 92. 5%. The model was then used to identify neuron types that preferentially contributed to cortispinal waves. The model predicted that activation of L PTNs and affer to L PT were the most important contributors to cortisp waves. This was consistent with the results of the TV analysis. The model was also used to predict the latency of cortisp waves based on the shortest conduction of the path to L PTNs. The model was able to predict the latency with an accuracy of 92. 5. The model was then used to identify neuron types that preferentially modulated cortisp waves. The model predicted that activation of L/ IT and L6 were the most important modulators of cortisp. This was consistent with the results of the TV analysis. The model was also used to predict the origins of affer that give rise to Iaves. The model predicted that affer to L PT and affer L3 were the most likely to give rise to Iaves. This was consistent with the results of TV analysis. The results of the study support the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to cortisp waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of affer to the cortex as well as specific types within the motor cortex initiate Iaves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analysis on complex models relating the results to network structure and identify mechanisms underlying response to acute stimulation.

    Title: 
    Article: Cell-free placental DNA ( cfpDNA ) is present in maternal circulation during gestation. CfpDNA carries great potential as a research and clinical tool as it provides a means to investigate the placental ( epi ) genome across gestation, which previously required invasive placenta sampling procedures. CfpDNA has been widely implemented in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ). Despite this, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting the research and clinical utility of cfpDNA. This review will examine the current knowledge of cfpDNA, including origins and molecular characteristics, highlight gaps in knowledge, and discuss future research directions. 
 Cell-free placental DNA ( cfpDNA ) is shed into maternal circulation throughout pregnancy [1]. CfpDNA has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and has been estimated to comprise up to approximately 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA [2–4]. Since its discovery in 1997, cfpDNA has been used in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations, most notably chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the understanding of the basic biology underlying cfpDNA remains limited, placing constraints on the information that can be obtained from analyzing cfpDNA. Gaps in knowledge include cfpDNA fragmentation processes, release mechanisms, form, and function. CfpDNA carries the potential for real-time study and monitoring of placental health and development. Further characterization of physical, genetic, and epigenetic characteristics of cfpDNA will pave the way for further basic research and clinical applications. In this review, we will examine the current understanding of cfpDNA, highlight gaps in knowledge, and discuss future research directions ( Fig 1 ). While this review focuses on pregnancy, much of what is discussed applies to the cell-free DNA field in general, including other clinical contexts such as cancer. 
 The placenta is a transient organ that forms during gestation. It facilitates the exchange of molecules between the fetal and maternal bloodstreams to support the physiological needs of the developing feto-placental unit. The placenta arises from the trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst, which further differentiates into cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and extravillous trophoblasts [5]. Trophoblasts invade and reconstruct the innermost layer of the uterus, the endometrium ( Fig 2A ). Within the decidua, the differentiated and reconstructed layer of the endometrium, the invading trophoblasts develop into tree-like projections called chorionic villi ( Fig 2B ). Chorionic villi are composed of an inner stromal core and outer trophoblast layer [6]. Mesenchymal cells in the stromal core form capillaries which circulate fetal blood from the umbilical blood vessels [7]. The spaces between chorionic villi form the intervillous space which is eventually filled with maternal blood. Extravillous trophoblasts invade and remodel uterine spiral arteries, veins, and glands in the endometrium to establish maternal blood circulation and glandular secretion in the intervillous space [8]. Maternal blood circulation to the intervillous space is initially blocked by trophoblast plugs in the uterine vessels. At around 10 to 12 weeks of gestation, trophoblast plugs are displaced as spiral artery remodeling progresses and maternal blood flow to the intervillous space is initiated [9]. The layers of the chorionic villi, namely the trophoblasts and fetal capillary endothelium, form the placental barrier, which maintains separation of the fetal and maternal bloodstreams [6]. At the placental barrier, molecules including nutrients, gases, and hormones are exchanged between fetal and maternal blood. Various mechanisms are used by molecules to cross the placental barrier including passive and facilitated diffusion, active transport, and vesicular transport [10]. Through this exchange, oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the fetus while waste products, such as carbon dioxide, exit the fetal bloodstream to be excreted by the mother. The placenta also carries out an endocrine function by secreting hormones to signal the maternal body to maintain an environment that supports feto-placental growth throughout gestation [11]. Abnormal placental morphology and function is observed in various pregnancy complications. Preeclampsia is the new onset of maternal hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation which can lead to multi-organ system failure [12]. The condition is heterogeneous in the range and severity of symptoms and placental lesions. Therefore, there is not one specific cause of preeclampsia, rather multiple disease subtypes with different etiologies that are currently being elucidated [13–16]. Shallow trophoblast invasion, improper spiral artery remodeling, and the resulting poor placental perfusion has been a long-standing model for the etiology of preeclampsia [17]. It is believed that this causes placental hypoxia which leads to a systemic maternal response and endothelial dysfunction [18]. Other factors including maternal cardiovascular health are also believed to contribute to preeclampsia pathogenesis [17, 18]. Preeclampsia poses serious short- and long-term risks to both the pregnant person and offspring including fetal growth restriction, cardiovascular disease later in life, and mortality [19]. Fetal growth restriction is characterized by pathologically poor fetal growth [20]. Among other factors, it can be caused by inadequate oxygen and nutrient transport to the fetus due to abnormal placentation and poor placental perfusion [21]. Fetal growth restriction impacts the development of the fetus’ organs and body systems, increasing risks of morbidities across the lifespan [22]. Therefore, proper placental development and function are critical for maternal and offspring health both during and after pregnancy. The etiologies of many pregnancy complications remain poorly understood. Work over the past several years has revealed the roles of various molecular networks in placental development and function in both healthy and complicated pregnancies [23–25]. Advancements in understanding the molecular basis of pregnancy complications are invaluable for the creation of treatments and screening and diagnosis tools for earlier and more targeted intervention. Further research utilizing new technologies and models, such as cfpDNA, will help to drive these necessary advancements. 
 Despite commonly being referred to as “cell-free fetal DNA, ” there is a large body of evidence demonstrating that “cell-free fetal DNA” mainly originates from trophoblasts, the major cell type of the placenta. Therefore, it is more accurate to refer to “cell-free fetal DNA ( cffDNA ) ” as “cell-free placental DNA ( cfpDNA ). ” Reports of normal first trimester cfpDNA levels in anembryonic pregnancies [26], the presence of cfpDNA before the establishment of fetal circulation [27], cell-free DNA release in in vitro placental explant studies [28–32], and cases of confined placental mosaicism in which cfpDNA corresponds to trophoblast karyotypes [33–40] provide direct evidence supporting the trophoblastic origin of cfpDNA. Additionally, detection of cell-free DNA carrying placenta-specific DNA methylation patterns in maternal plasma [41–44] and correlation between the placental and cfpDNA methylomes [45, 46] solidify the placenta as the main source of cfpDNA. Reports of increased cfpDNA concentrations in conditions involving placental dysfunction, such as preeclampsia [47–49], invasive placenta ( placenta accreta and increta ), and placenta previa [50] point towards the placental origin of cfpDNA as these observations are hypothesized to be due to increased trophoblast cell death. In this review, we will use the term “cffDNA” when referring specifically to DNA originating from the fetus and use “cfpDNA” when referring to DNA originating from the placenta. The term “cell-free DNA” will be used to describe cell-free DNA in general, regardless of tissue of origin and both within and beyond the context of pregnancy. Both fetal- and placenta-derived messenger RNA transcripts have been detected in maternal plasma, suggesting contributions from both the fetus and placenta to cell-free nucleic acids in maternal circulation [51–53]. While it is possible that fetal tissues and cells release cffDNA into maternal circulation, they are likely not major contributors to total maternal plasma cell-free DNA. Fetal cells such as erythroblasts have previously been hypothesized to be a source of cffDNA. However, fetal cells are present in maternal plasma in significantly lower quantities than cfpDNA ( 1. 2 fetal cells/ml of blood versus 25. 4 copies of cfpDNA/ml of plasma ) [54, 55]. Concentrations of fetal erythroblasts and cfpDNA are not correlated and change independently of each other [48, 56]. In vitro release of cffDNA from fetal membranes with fragment sizes consistent with plasma cfpDNA has been demonstrated [32, 57]. However, fetal membranes were reported to release less cell-free DNA than placental explants ( 15. 5 ng cell-free DNA/mg of fetal membrane versus 73. 7 ng cell-free DNA/mg of placenta after 1 h in culture ) [32]. Therefore, it is unlikely that fetal cells are a major source of maternal cell-free DNA. The placenta is the primary source of cell-free DNA in maternal circulation during pregnancy. The placenta releases cDNA into the maternal circulation throughout gestation. cDNA has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and comprises up to 40% of maternal plasma cell-free DNA [2–4]. cDNA has been used in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploidy. However, understanding the biology of cDNA remains limited, placing constraints on information that can be obtained from analyzing cDNA. Gaps in knowledge include cDNA processes, mechanisms, form, and function. cDNA carries potential for real-time monitoring of placental health and development. Further characterization of physical, genetic, and epigenetic of cDNA will pave the way for basic and clinical applications. The placenta is a transient organ that forms during gestation.

    Title: 
    Article: Hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using data from genome-wide association studies, we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs ( breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers ), contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits. We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs: two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC. Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility. 
 Breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers are hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) that together account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year [1]. These cancers share several environmental, behavioural and genetic risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology [2, 3]. This premise is supported by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) which have identified hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci [4–7] and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs [8–11]. The detection of pleiotropic loci suggests that shared genetic factors likely contribute to polygenic risk of HDCs and raises the possibility of common driver genes and biological pathways. A key aim of post-GWAS is to identify the target gene ( s ) that are affected at each GWAS region. This is complicated by the fact that most risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome making it difficult to interpret how they contribute to cancer susceptibility [12]. Target gene mapping for pleiotropic loci typically relies on statistical approaches such as expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) and transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) [9, 10, 13]. However, these methods are limited by small sample sizes which reduces power, the use of steady-state gene expression and the lack of data from relevant tissues. Orthologous functional assays provide complementary mapping approaches to better define regulatory variants and connect them to their target genes. 
 While most GWAS variants are dispersed across the genome, several genomic regions harbour variants for multiple cancer types, suggesting common target gene ( s ) may drive these associations. Independent signals for HDC were obtained from large-scale GWAS, meta-analyses and fine-mapping ( 196 breast [4], 17 endometrial [5], 60 ovarian [6] and 258 prostate cancer index variants [7] ). To assess whether HDC variants were more frequently positioned together than would be expected by chance, we defined “clusters” when variants associated with two or more HDCs were co-localized within the same 100 kb window. We compared observed cluster frequency to a null distribution, generated by randomly shuffling variants one million times ( see Methods ), and recounted cluster occurrence in each random set. This resulted in a statistically significant increase in observed frequency ( Fig 1A; P < 10−6, permutation test ). As an additional comparison, index variants for four genetically uncorrelated traits [14] were obtained from the Open Target Genetics portal ( 179 for coronary artery disease, 22 lung cancer, 38 Alzheimer’s disease and 94 Parkinson’s disease [15] ). These traits showed similar genomic distributions to randomly generated background regions ( Fig 1A ), which provided support that HDC risk regions co-localize in the genome and that these regions likely contain pleiotropic variants and common target genes. To identify candidate multi-HDC risk ( mHDCR ) regions, we extended the variants of each HDC by 0. 5 Mb on either side, resulting in cancer-specific risk regions. mHDCR regions were defined as areas where the cancer-specific risk regions of at least two HDCs overlapped ( Fig 1B ). We did not consider linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) between variants of each cancer type, focussing solely on their positional relationships. In total, 44 mHDCR regions were identified across the genome ( Fig 1C and S1 Table ). Two mHDCR regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 mHDCR regions for three HDCs ( seven breast-ovarian-prostate, four breast-endometrial-prostate and two endometrial-ovarian-prostate ) and 28 mHDCR regions for two cancer types ( twenty breast-prostate, four breast-ovarian, two ovarian-prostate, one endometrial-ovarian and one endometrial-prostate ) ( Fig 1D ). Compared to ovarian and endometrial cancers, the significantly larger sample sizes [4, 7] resulted in most breast and prostate mHDCR regions containing at least three independent signals per cancer type ( Fig 1E ). Candidate mHDCR gene ( s ) within the 44 mHDCR regions were identified using a multistep computational approach ( Fig 2A ). For endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers, each variant was expanded to include all candidate variants ( r2 ≥ 0. 8; 1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5 reference ) ( S2 Table ). For breast cancer, the candidate causal variants from the recent fine-mapping study were used [4]. We first annotated each mHDCR region with protein-coding genes from GENCODE ( v37 basic ) and intersected all candidate variants with genomic annotations ( exons, promoters defined as transcription start site ( TSS ) ± 2 kb and intronic and intergenic regions; S1A Fig ). In total, 134 ( ~6% ) of the risk variants mapped to protein-coding gene exons, while 4132 ( ~94% ) were located in noncoding regions. Exonic variants were filtered using Ensembl variant effect predictor ( VEP ) [16] which identified one frameshift and 33 moderate-impact missense and untranslated region ( UTR ) variants ( S1B Fig and S3 Table ). Seven potential splicing variants were also detected with SpliceAI [17] and MaxEntScan [18]. The noncoding variants were further explored for regulatory functions using RegulomeDB [19] and ChromHMM data from EpiMap [20]. Pre-calculated RegulomeDB scores for dbSNP v153 common SNPs ( MAF ≥ 0. 01 ) were downloaded from regulomedb. org. From this dataset, we extracted two key metrics: the RegulomeDB ranking, where a score of 1 indicates stronger supporting evidence for regulatory function and probability scores, where a score of 1 indicates higher likelihood that a variant is regulatory ( S4 Table ). ChromHMM data was available for three breast, five prostate, three ovarian and one endometrial tissue sample or cell line. We annotated the chromatin states of all potential regulatory variants using ChromHMM signatures [20] ( S4 Table ). Previous studies have performed functional assays for some of the noncoding variants in individual HDCs [21–24]. For example, Lawrenson et al used 3D mapping and reporter assays to show that breast and ovarian cancer risk variants at 19p13 influence distal enhancers, which in turn regulate ABHD8 expression [22]. Furthermore, Stegeman et al used reporter assays to show a prostate cancer risk variant alters microRNA binding to the MDM4 3’UTR [23]. These studies provide additional support that the variants can impact target gene expression through various mechanisms. An initial analysis identified 17 candidate mHDCR genes ( across 11 mHDCR regions ) that contain exonic, promoter or potential splicing variants associated with two or more HDCs ( Figs 2B and S1C and S5 Table ). For those candidate mHDCR genes with promoter variants, all were supported by evidence of cell-type-specific regulatory activity from ChromHMM ( S4 Table ). Additionally, six are cancer genes based on information from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC [25] ), while the remaining genes may represent new pleiotropic HDC risk genes. One example is the PAX9 transcription factor ( TF; mHDCR region 18 ) [26] which has a missense breast cancer risk variant plus promoter and intronic breast and prostate cancer risk variants ( Fig 2C ). Rs2236007 ( breast ) and rs12882923 ( prostate ) were the top-ranked variants on RegulomeDB and mapped to transcriptionally active open chromatin ( ChromHMM TSS signatures in breast and prostate samples; S4 Table ). Previous studies in breast cells showed that the rs2236007 risk g-allele reduced PAX9 promoter activity [27], via recruitment of the suppressive TF EGR1 and increased breast cancer cell growth [28]. In contrast, the rs12823 risk-allele increased P9 expression in prostate cells [29]. These results suggest that P9 is a pleotropic HDC risk gene with opposing roles in breast and prostate cancer. Another candidate HDC gene is the lncRNA ( mDCR 14 ) [30], which is associated with ovarian and endrial cancer risk ( Figs 2D and S5 ). The lncRNA was previously identified as a risk factor in ovarian cancer [31] and endometrial cancer [32]. We found that the lnc risk-allele was associated with increased expression in ovarian and endrial cancer cell lines ( S6 and S Table ). The risk-allele was also mapped to transcriptionally active chromatin in ovarian and endrial samples ( ChromMM TSS; S Table ), suggesting that the lnc acts as a risk factor in both cancers. In addition to lnc, we identified several risk alleles in regions that altered TF motifs ( Figs 2E and S6 and S Table ). For example, the risk-allele in mDC region 25 altered the binding site for the TF E2F1 ( Fig 2E ) and the risk-allele in mDC 28 altered the site for the TF3 ( Fig 2 ). These results suggest that these variants impact gene expression through regulatory mechanisms. Drug targets were overrepresented among the candidate HDC genes ( Figs 2 and S7 and S Table ). For example, P9 was targeted in breast cancer [33] and prostate cancer [34], while the lnc was targeted in ovarian [35] and endrial cancer [36]. This implies that some HDC genes may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC. Our study provides a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility. This approach integrates GWAS, epigenomics, and chromatin maps from diverse cell models to annotate candidate genes at risk regions. We identified 53 candidate HDC genes at 22 mDC regions and pinpointed lnc as potential targets and risk alleles in regions that altered TF motifs. Our results highlight the importance of considering noncoding variants and regulatory mechanisms in HDC and suggest that some HDC genes may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repur existing treatments.

    Title: 
    Article: Recently we characterized polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog. The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause. Here we report the results of our molecular genetic investigation. A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4. 7*10−10 ). Haplotype analysis indicated that the cases shared a 2. 9 Mb region in the homozygous or the heterozygous state. Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment, located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0. 81 in the available cases and 0. 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed. Leukocytes of affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens. We suggest that elements located 10–49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. Postulating causality, the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0. 5–2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region. 
 An autoimmune-mediated inflammatory myopathy ( IM ) was seen with increasing frequency in the breed of Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes, named Kooiker dogs hereafter [1]. The dogs presented with locomotion problems with or without dysphagia. Serum creatine kinase activity was almost invariably elevated, and histopathology of available muscle biopsies revealed predominantly lymphohistiocytic infiltration usually showing a low and variable number of eosinophils, neutrophils and plasma cells [1]. Detailed pathological investigation and immunological characterization of cellular infiltrates were indicative of polymyositis ( PM ) [2]. The condition occurred more often in the Kooiker dog breed than in other breeds and littermates of affected dogs appeared to be at increased risk for developing PM. Therefore, a genetic background was suspected. Dog breeds in general have been established with a small number of founders, are therefore genetically homogeneous and excellent sources for molecular research of monogenic and polygenic traits [3–6]. Inherited causes of distinct forms of IM have been investigated in Vizsla dogs, Boxers, Newfoundland dogs, Dutch shepherd dogs, Shetland sheepdogs and Collies [7–10]. One haplotype of MHC class II genes appeared to be a risk factor for PM in Vizsla dogs [7]. Another MHC class II haplotype was associated with dermatomyositis in the related breeds of Shetland sheepdogs and Collies [8]. Additional risk variants in these two breeds were recognized in the genes PAN2 and MAP3K7CL, and the risk of dermatomyositis increased with the total number of risk alleles carried by the dogs. An autosomal recessive IM in Dutch shepherd dogs in an isolated breeding line in the US was reported to be caused by a variant in the mitochondrial aspartate and glutamate carrier encoded by SLC25A12 [9]. The homozygous mutant genotype appeared to lead to the IM phenotype with complete penetrance. Autoimmune diseases in humans have frequently been associated with specific alleles or haplotypes of the HLA locus. Indeed, the strongest genetic risk factor for idiopathic IM in humans is located in the HLA region [11]. Other genes that have been associated with human idiopathic IM and PM include SDK2, LINC00924, STAT4, NAB1, TEC, LTBR, DGQK, and FAM167A-BLK [11]. At the functional level, it was shown that interleukin 21 ( IL-21 ) is expressed by cellular infiltrates in muscles of PM patients [12]. The immune system depends largely on the communication between leukocytes through a variety of interleukins. Unraveling the complex network of interleukin expression and their actions is a major effort in the research of the immune system and autoimmune diseases. We set out to study the molecular genetics of the specific form of PM that is prevalent in the Kooiker dog breed. 
 The dogs entered in this study were examined and handled by licensed veterinarians. Tests were performed and samples were collected in the course of routine diagnosis and care. All dogs were privately owned and included with informed consent of their owners. Thus we complied to the conditions set forth in the Dutch ‘Wet op de Uitoefening van de Diergeneeskunde’ ( Law on the Practice of Veterinary Medicine ) of March 21, 1990 and approval of an ethics committee for the use of samples of the animals was not necessary. Affected purebred Kooiker dogs were referred to the veterinary neurology unit of the University Clinic for Companion Animals of Utrecht University by owners, made known to us by veterinary practitioners, or retrieved from the breed club register of the VHNK ( Association the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje ). The cases fulfilled at least three of the four criteria of Bohan and Peter [13]: 1 ) symmetric proximal muscle weakness; 2 ) elevated muscle enzymes; 3 ) spontaneous activity on the EMG; 4 ) characteristic muscle biopsy abnormalities as described [1]. The DNA was isolated from EDTA-blood by use of a Chemagen MSM I robot or Magcore HF16plus robot using consumables and protocols supplied by the manufacturers. The DNA of 102 affected dogs was available. The unaffected controls were Kooiker dogs of which the DNA was tested earlier at the Expertise Centre of Genetics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University for gene variants involved in Von Willebrand disease or hereditary necrotizing myelopathy [3, 4]. The DNA of more than 4, 000 Kooiker dogs born between 1988 and 2022 was available. Parents and ancestors of cases were retrieved using pedigree data. A group of 112 dogs was compiled to serve as a random comparison group for allele frequency measurement. Survival times and box plots in relation to genotypes were analyzed with SPSS version 29. An initial group of 28 Kooiker dog PM cases was sent for genotyping of 172, 115 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip to the company Neogen. The control group of 106 Kooiker dogs was genotyped on the same platform for unrelated projects at the Centre National de Génotypage, Paris, France. The case-control comparison was performed with Genabel software version 1. 6–6 with adjustment for stratification and relatedness as described [14]. Haplotypes were deduced using PHASE 2. 1 [15]. Homozygosity mapping was done with PLINK software version 1. 9 using default settings [16]. Fragments of all gene exons and adjacent 25 bp in the region of interest on CFA19 from position 15, 000, 000–24, 500, 000 plus the complete upstream, introns and intergenic fragments of the IL21 and IL2 genes from position 17, 554, 000–17, 757, 000 within that region were enriched with Agilent Sureselect technology from sheared DNA of 8 PM affected and 4 unaffected Kooiker dogs. The genes of which the exons were included in the enrichment are listed in S1 Table. Library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA Prep Kit. The enriched libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with a coverage of 100x on average. Mapping and variant calling of the paired-end reads of 150 bases were achieved using a custom bioinformatic pipeline based on the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner algorithm [17]. SAMtools was used for annotation and initial variant calling against the reference genome CanFam3. 1 release 75 [18]. The positions of the variations were adjusted to the reference genome UU_Cfam_GSD_1. 0 using a liftover tool [19]. The possibly functional effect of DNA sequence variants was evaluated with snpSift and snpEff version 4. 1 [20]. In addition, the region of the IL21/IL2 locus was inspected for rearrangements using Integrative Genome viewer version 2. 5. 0 [21]. Later, three genomes, one of a healthy Kooiker dog that was homozygous for the identified risk allele and sired an PM case, and two heterozygous cases, were fully sequenced with a coverage of 30x and mapped to UU_Cfam_GSD_1. 0 using methods described above. The DNA sequence data of these dogs has been made available ( SRA BioProject accession number PRJNA1092409 ). To evaluate the presence of a 39 kb deletion in Kooiker dogs, a PCR was designed with a single forward primer I ( CTCCAGAGAAGAACCACAGGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAG

    Title: 
    Article: Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as food processing, therapeutics, and the identification of pathogenic mutations. Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability, and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. In this work, we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction. ESMtherm is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESMtherm performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature. 
 Protein stability is one of the foundations of protein engineering to design resilient proteins for industrial processes and therapeutic manufacturing [1–3]. Beyond protein engineering, destabilizing mutations are associated with pathogenicity, and stability predictors can help identify pathogenic mutations across human proteome [4–7]. Molecular modeling methods, including Rosetta [8, 9], FoldX [10], and molecular dynamics simulations [11], have been shown to predict the impact of mutation on protein stability. More recently, the use of machine learning models grounded in biophysical features and evolutionary statistics [12–20] has offered an alternative approach to stability and function prediction without the need for computationally intensive molecular modeling simulations. Fueled by the latest advances in deep learning, convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) [21] and graph neural networks ( GNNs ) [22] are now being adopted to predict mutational impacts on stability by operating directly on the input protein structure [23, 24]. For example, RaSP is a CNN-based model trained on top of Rosetta [25], while ELASPIC-2, another stability predictor, operates on both sequence embedding from ESM and structural embedding from GNN [26–28]. Despite these advancements, the lack of a consistent and universal dataset remains an obstacle. While merging smaller datasets into a more comprehensive collection, such as ProTherm [29], ProtaBank [30] and ThermoMutDB [31], is a feasible approach, combined datasets often consist of closely related but distinct quantities accompanied by additional discrepancies in experimental conditions. While deep mutagenesis scanning ( DMS ) offers profound insights, these studies typically focus on a single protein target, limiting the broader applicability of the derived data and models subsequently trained on these datasets. In light of these challenges, Tsuboyama et al. introduced a mega-scale thermostability dataset, encompassing 776k short protein sequences derived from 479 small protein domains, all consistently evaluated using the same assay [32]. Utilizing this dataset, we fine-tuned a protein language model ( pLM ), named ESMtherm, from ESM-2 [33] to act as an end-to-end stability predictor. We observe that ESMtherm performs comparably with state-of-the-art models and generalizes to small protein sequences distal to those of the training set. We also demonstrate that training on an ensemble of protein domains, instead of mutagenesis studies of a single domain, improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein language model for folding stability prediction. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of ESMtherm and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods in the ability to generalize to longer protein sequences. 
 Protein stability prediction can be assessed on different scales of generalizability. Although machine learning algorithms are often trained and tested on different sets of non-overlapping samples, the definition of overlap is ambiguous in protein sequences. For example, assigning two point mutants from the same WW domain, one to the training set and another to the test set, can assess the generalizability of the model to sequences sharing the same protein domain. However, it fails to evaluate the generalizability of the model to a domain different from those in the training set, such as an SH2 domain. To benchmark our model on both scales, our test set sequences consist of two parts. The first part is formed by protein domains also found in training set, whereas the second part consists of protein domains exclusively found in test set only, denoted as test-set-only domains. We assess the model performance by Spearman’s R, and its capability to generalize to these test-set-only sequences by the highest sequence identity to any domains in the training set. Given that domains are classified according to the wildtype definitions by Tsuboyama et al. [32], it is possible for domains exclusive to the test set to still share considerable sequence identity with those in the training set. This setup allows for an assessment of generalizability across varying degrees of sequence identity. The dataset-splitting scheme is illustrated in Fig 1 and further detailed in Methods and Materials. ESMtherm generalizes reasonably well to 47 test-set-only protein domains, illustrated in Fig 2. The Spearman’s R evaluated on individual domains ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 9, except for the uncharacterized bacterial protein yahO ( PDB code: 2MA4 ) [34]. Among all test-set-only domains, SH3-subunit of chicken alpha spectrin ( PDB code: 6SCW ) [35] has the highest sequence identity of 95. 8% and scores a corresponding Spearman’s R of 0. 88. Going down the ladder to test-set-only domains in lower sequence identity, our model scores worse in Homo sapein J-domain protein HSJ1a ( PDB code: 2LGW ) [36] at 59% identity but still retains a Spearman’s R of 0. 52. In the 13 cases where no alignment with the training set sequences passes e-value < 10−3, ESMtherm is capable of generalizing to both natural and de novo proteins. No training sequence can be aligned to Escherichia coli DNA-binding arginine repressor ( PDB code: 1AOY ) [37], and yet its Spearman’s R evaluated is 0. 69. For de novo designs, we highlight two protein domains from Baker Lab. αββα domain ( HEEH_KT_rd6_0790 ) is a mini-protein from high-throughput computational design with Rosetta [38], whereas the trRosetta-hallucinated structure ( r11_233_TrROS_Hall ) was sampled with iterative sequence refinement to improve the confidence in the prediction of residue-residue distance map [39]. Spearman’s R on these domains is 0. 44 and 0. 72, respectively. Prior to the work by Tsuboyama et al. [32], DMS was often restricted to a single protein of interest. In the case where the target of interest is not thoroughly mapped, site-saturated mutagenesis studies from a homologous sequence ( s ) might provide insights into selecting the best mutation for the specific function of interest. However, direct cross-comparison between proteins is often complicated by the difference in measured quantities and experimental conditions between functional assays. This inconsistency makes it difficult to highlight the benefits of learning from multiple target proteins collectively in a systematic manner. The mega-scale dataset addresses this difficulty by measuring folding stability across multiple protein domains in a uniform experimental condition, and it helps us compare two paradigms, i. e. transfer learning from homologous sequences and learning from all domains collectively. To contrast these approaches, we assess the generalizability of the model fine-tuned on these paradigms on test-set-only protein domains. Extrapolating to test-set-only domains clearly benefits from learning all domains collectively. Collective training improves Spearman’s R by 0. 16 on average ( p-value = 6x10-3 ), as illustrated in Fig ( 3 ). CdnL protein ( PDB code: 2LQK ) [40] cannot be aligned with any training sequence and instead was matched with its closest structural alignment ( PDB code: 2BTT ) [41] with Foldseek [42]. Collective training increased CdnL’s Spearman R from -0. 25 to 0. 65. Similarly, amino-terminal domain of phase 434 repressor ( PDB code: 1R69 ) [43] was matched by structural alignment to a redesigned protein G ( PDB code: 1EM7 ) [44] with a TM-score of 0. 23, and gained 0. 74 in Spearman’s R from -0. 22 to 0. 52. Looking into the domains with sequence alignment to the training set, WW domain from APBB3 ( PDB code: 2YSC ) shares 47% identity with its training-set partner ( PDB code: 1WR7 ) and yet still benefits from multi-domain training with an improvement of 0. 32. In contrast, uncharacterized yahO protein remains a difficult target. Compared to training on its closest training-set domain ( PDB code: 1IGV ), learning on multiple domains only improves the correlation from -0. 35 to -0. 14. Overall, these results highlight the benefit of training on multiple domains for generalizability to test-only protein. In conclusion, we present ESMm, a mega-scale language model for predicting protein stability trained on 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 domains. ESMm generalizes reasonably to small protein and test-only domains and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizability to test-only protein. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature. We also demonstrate the benefit of training on multiple domains for generalizability to test-only protein and discuss the limitations of our model compared to state-of-the-art in generalizability to longer sequences.

    Title: 
    Article: Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells. There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections. We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental, iKIRs would have an opposite effect. We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity. In T1D, variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk, indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response, we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11, 961 ) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent data set. We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. 
 Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by insulin-deficiency due to the destruction of insulin-producing islet β-cells. The exact aetiology of T1D remains elusive, but environmental triggers are thought to initiate the break in peripheral tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest genetic contributors to susceptibility to T1D are the human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) genes [1, 2]. Within the HLA region, the closely linked classical class II HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 genes display the strongest associations indicating that CD4+ T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. In particular, DRB1*04:01/02/04/05-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 and DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 haplotypes are associated with the highest T1D susceptibility whereas DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 is associated with dominant protection [3]. Here we study a family of inhibitory receptors called inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ). iKIRs are expressed predominantly on natural killer ( NK ) cells and, at a lower frequency, on late stage differentiated T cells. The ligands of iKIRs are HLA class I molecules which they bind in broad allele groups, e. g. KIR3DL1 binds HLA-B alleles with a Bw4 motif at positions 77–83 [4]. The iKIR genes and the genes encoding their HLA class I ligands are located on different chromosomes and so are inherited independently. Consequently, it is common for individuals to have one or more iKIRs without the corresponding ligand; if an individual is positive for a given iKIR as well as the matching ligand we refer to that iKIR as “functional”. iKIRs play a major role in regulating innate NK cell-mediated responses but there is increasing evidence that iKIRs also modulate adaptive T cell responses [5–7]. In particular, iKIRs have been reported to increase activated T cell survival and to dampen effector function. The two main mechanisms of increased T cell survival are inhibition of activation-induced cell death ( attributed to iKIRs expressed on T cells ) and inhibition of NK cell-mediated killing of activated T cells ( attributed to iKIRs expressed on NK cells ) [8–11]. We have previously found that iKIRs together with their ligands significantly enhance CD8+ T cell survival in humans [7]. Furthermore, iKIRs with their ligands also enhance protective and detrimental HLA class I associations and have a significant impact on the clinical outcome of three different chronic viral infections [10, 12]. We distinguish this modulation of protective and detrimental HLA associations by functional iKIR, which we suggest is due to a modulation of T cell responses by iKIR, from a main effect of functional iKIR, which we suggest is more likely to be NK cell-mediated [10, 12]. Evidence for a main effect of iKIR or functional iKIR in T1D is weak. Since 2003, 15 studies have reported KIR gene associations with T1D risk, but none has been consistently reproduced and, in a recent meta-analysis, no associations survived correction for multiple comparisons [13]. A few studies have explored functional iKIR associations i. e. associations between iKIR-HLA ligand gene pairs and T1D [14–16] but again, results are not consistent across the studies. The impact of functional iKIR on HLA associations has not been studied. We postulated that, given their impact on adaptive immune responses in chronic viral infections, iKIRs might play an analogous role in autoimmunity. Associations between HLA class II genes and T1D are clear evidence that CD4+ T cells play a role in T1D. We hypothesized that if iKIRs modulate CD4+ T cell responses then this should be manifest as an iKIR modulation of HLA class II genetic associations. We sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of iKIRs on HLA class II disease associations in T1D using a large ( N = 11, 961 ) case-control dataset from the UK Genetics Resource Investigating Diabetes ( UK-GRID ). We identified a consistent and significant functional iKIR modification of HLA class II protective associations. The size of this effect was striking, for instance the odds ratio of iKIR in DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02+ individuals is 6. 12; one of the largest genetic effects reported in T1D in recent decades and is replicated across all protective class II genotypes. These findings are reproduced in a smaller independent dataset consisting of 342 US multiplex T1D families from the Human Biological Data Interchange ( HBDI ). Our immunogenetic analyses show that genes encoding iKIRs with their ligands decrease protective class II genetic associations, consistent with a picture in which iKIRs modulate T cell-mediated regulation of autoimmunity. 
 The DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 compound genotype has repeatedly been described to confer protection from T1D [17] and this protective effect is reproduced in our cohort ( ln[OR] = -3. 75, P = 1. 05x10-157 ). There is some evidence that the protection associated with the DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 genotype maps to DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 ( henceforth DQ6 ), which encodes the DQ6 molecule, rather than DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 ( henceforth DR15 ) [18, 19]. In our cohort, virtually everyone who carries DQ6 also carries DR15 ( 99. 2% of DQ6 positive individuals are DR15 positive ) so it is difficult to fine map the protective genotype. When both DQ6 and DR15 are included simultaneously in a regression analysis, DQ6 retains significance ( ln[OR] = -2. 86, P = 6. 1x10-3 ) whereas DR15 becomes non-significant ( ln[OR] = -0. 9, P = 0. 4 ) in line with the literature [18, 19]. We therefore focused our analysis on DQ6. However, results focusing instead on DR15 ( either as a phased haplotype or compound genotype ) are virtually identical ( see S1 Results ). For each individual we calculated their “iKIR score”, a value equal to the count of iKIR-ligand gene pairs in that individual weighted by the strength of the iKIR-HLA interaction ( S1 Materials and methods and [10] ) so that a large iKIR score reflects someone with a large number of strong iKIR-ligand interactions. iKIR score is protective in our cohort ( ln[OR] = -0. 22, P = 2. 8x10-25 ). However, in a model including iKIR ligands ( Bw4, C1 and C2 ) as covariates, the iKIR score association is lost ( ln[OR] = -0. 008, P = 0. 85 ) and Bw4 is strongly protective ( ln[OR] = -0. 45, P = 9. 1x10-16 ). Therefore, the iKIR score association is probably driven by KIR ligands alone; for example, by the protective or detrimental effect of B4, C1 and C. We conclude that iIR modulate CD4 T cell responses in T1 by decreasing protective H class II genetic associations and suggest that iIR play a role in the regulation of autoimmunity.

    Title: 
    Article: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss, and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18. 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. Here we comprehensively describe CTG18. 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ), generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18. 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18. 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD. We employ long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD, and unique transcripts associated with CTG18. 1-expansions. Similarly, differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. Furthermore, differential exon usage, pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences. Lastly, exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency <0. 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD>15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18. 1 may increase FECD risk. In summary, our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease. 
 Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is a common, age-related, and visually disabling disease that represents a leading indication for corneal transplantation in high-income countries ) [1, 2]. It primarily affects the corneal endothelium, a monolayer of post-mitotic cells on the posterior corneal surface that function to maintain relative corneal dehydration. As the disease progresses, collagenous excrescences ( guttae ) form on the thickened corneal endothelial basement membrane ( Descemet membrane ) and corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) undergo accelerated cell death, which results in corneal oedema and opacity [3]. Affected individuals typically experience symptoms in their 5th to 6th decade, with glare, reduced contrast sensitivity, and blurred vision [4]. Transplantation of donor endothelial tissue is the preferred treatment for cases with visually significant symptoms. However, given an increasing societal burden of age-related disease coupled with a global shortage of suitable donor tissue, there is a pressing clinical need for alternative treatments [3, 5]. Up to 80% of FECD cases of European descent have one or more expanded copies of a CTG trinucleotide repeat element ( termed CTG18. 1; MIM #613267 ) located within an intronic region of the transcription factor gene 4, TCF4 [4, 6]. We have previously demonstrated, in our large ( n = 450 ) FECD cohort, that an expanded copy of this CTG repeat ( defined as ≥50 copies ) confers >76-fold increased risk for developing FECD [7]. Expansion of non-coding repeat elements within the human genome have been identified to cause more than 30 human diseases to date [8], including fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome ( MIM #300623 ), myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 ( MIM #160900 and #602668 ) and C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and frontotemporal dementia ( MIM #105550 ) [8]. Expansion-positive ( Exp+ ) FECD represents by far the most common disease within this category. However, to date, it has only been established that it affects the cornea, which is in contrast to the majority of the other much rarer non-coding repeat expansion disorders that typically have devastating outcomes on neurological and/or neuromuscular systems. Despite these differences, strong mechanistic molecular parallels exist between CTG18. 1-mediated FECD and other non-coding repeat expansion diseases, whereby multiple pathogenic mechanisms occur concurrently to drive pathology [8, 9]. We, and others, have demonstrated that RNA toxicity comprising splicing dysregulation attributed to the accumulation of CUG-containing RNA foci and sequestration of splicing factors MBNL1 and MBNL2 within affected cells, is a key feature of FECD in the presence of one or more expanded CTG18. 1 alleles [6, 7, 10–12]. Alongside this RNA induced toxicity, repeat-associated non-AUG ( RAN ) dependent translation of the expanded repeat, and dysregulation of TCF4 itself have also been hypothesised to contribute to the underlying pathology of CTG18. 1 Exp+ mediated FECD [13]. However, a comprehensive understanding of consequences and role of both the spliceopathy and downstream effects of the TCF4 dysregulation have yet to be characterised in parallel in the same model system. Furthermore, because TCF4 comprises >90 alternative spatially and temporally expressed isoforms, deciphering transcript-specific level dysregulation has proven to be extremely challenging and a consistent pattern of TCF4 dysregulation has yet to be associated with CTG18. 1 expansions in corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) [14–16]. Such diversity is reflected in the varied functional roles TCF4 plays in human development, alongside the range of human disease associated with TCF4 variants in addition to FECD. For example, TCF4 haploinsufficiency results in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome ( MIM #610954 ) [17, 18], a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, whereas somatic TCF4 mutations are commonly identified in Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma [19] and common germline variants have been associated with Schizophrenia risk [20, 21]. In this study, we used a large cohort of biologically independent primary FECD case-derived CECs to isolate the effects of the multiple parallel pathogenic processes underlying CTG18. 1-mediated FECD. We present long-read transcriptomic data to enhance our understanding of the increased isoform diversity observed in Exp+ FECD, and spatial transcriptomics to demonstrate TCF4-isoform dysregulation. For the first time, we also isolate downstream transcriptomic signatures of dysregulation that we hypothesise to be driven by TCF4-isoform dysregulation that may, in part, explain the tissue specificity of the disease. We go on to explore the potential relevance of TCF4 dysregulation to FECD, independent of the CTG18. 1 expansion, by interrogating expansion-negative FECD cases for rare TCF4 variants through exome sequencing and subsequently applying a gene-burden style approach. 
 To further increase our understanding of CTG18. 1 expansion-associated splicing dysregulation events, and better understand the relationship between individual events to transcript-specific isoforms, we generated long-read RNA-seq data from biologically independent unpassaged primary CEC cultures derived from healthy control ( n = 4, mean age 68. 8 years ) and Exp+ FECD ( mono-allelic CTG18. 1 allele repeat length ≥50 ) ( n = 4, mean age 66. 8 years ) tissues ( Tables 1 and S1 ). After alignment and stringent quality control, reads that displayed evidence of 5’ degradation, intrapriming and reverse transcription template switching were removed. Exp+ and control samples were subsequently analysed with SQANTI3 to assess isoform diversity ( Fig 1A and 1B and Tables 2 and S2 ). We also generated short-read RNA-seq data from unpassaged primary CEC cultures derived from healthy control ( n = 4, mean age 58. 5 years ), Exp+ FECD ( mono-allelic CTG18. 1 allele repeat length ≥50 ) ( n = 3, mean age 63. 3 years ) and Exp- FECD ( bi-allelic CTG18. 1 allele repeat lengths ≤30 ) ( n = 3, mean age 63. 3 years ) tissues ( Table 1 ). Exome data generated from the Exp- FECD cases utilised in this transcriptomic work were analysed for the presence of variants in any previously FECD-associated genes, such as TCF4, COL8A2, SLC4A11, ZEB1, and AGBL1 [4], to identify any potential underlying genetic cause. No rare ( MAF <0. 005 ) or potentially deleterious ( CADD >15 ) variants were identified. Hierarchical clustering using heatmap visualisation and PCA revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between Exp+ and Exp- FE ( Fig 2A and 2 and 2B ). Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between Exp+ and Exp- FE ( Fig 3A and 3 and 3B ) highlighted T4 as the most significantly upregulated gene in Exp+ FE ( p = 0. 0001 ). Furthermore, pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes between Exp+ and Exp- FE ( Fig 4 and 4A and 4B ) revealed T4 as the most significantly enriched pathway ( p = 0 0 0001 ). Exon usage analysis of differentially expressed genes between Exp+ and Exp FE ( Fig 5 and 5 and 5B ) highlighted T4 as the most differentially used exon ( p = 0 0 000 ). Spatial analysis of differentially expressed genes between Exp and Exp ( Fig 6 and 6 and 6 ) revealed T4 as the most spatially enriched ( p = 0 0 000 ). Exon usage analysis of differentially expressed between Exp and Exp ( Fig 7 and 7  and 7 ) highlighted T4 as the most differentially used ( p 0 0 000 ). Spatial analysis of differentially expressed between Exp and ( Fig 8 and 8 and 8 ) T4 revealed as most spatially enriched ( 0 000 ) Exome data from Exp- FE cases identified rare ( MAF < 0 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD > 15 ) T4 variants in 7/134 FE- cases, suggesting T4 variants independent of CT18.1 may increase FE risk. In summary, our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation both underpin the pathophysiology of FE. We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this triplet-mediated disease.

    Title: 
    Article: Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation, but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates. To investigate the genetic basis of LTG, we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra, which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures, using QTL-seq. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h, whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding. We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h. The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions. 
 Low-temperature seed germination ( LTG ) is a pivotal agronomic trait in rice ( Oryza sativa ). As rice originated from tropical and subtropical regions, it is highly susceptible to low-temperature conditions compared to other cereal crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) [1]. Nevertheless, rice is produced in temperate and high-altitude regions, where it frequently experiences temperatures below 20°C. In Japan, rice is abundantly cultivated in relatively cold areas such as Tohoku and Hokkaido. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand to shift from conventional transplantation-based rice cultivation to direct seeding to reduce labor and costs. However, direct seeding raises the risk of exposure to low temperatures during seed germination [2]. Therefore, to expand the use of direct seeding, it is crucial to breed rice cultivars with enhanced LTG. LTG is a quantitative trait regulated by complex molecular mechanisms. Linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified over 30 LTG-related quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) or genomic regions associated with this trait, located on all 12 rice chromosomes [3–20]. However, only a few genes involved in LTG have been described, such as qLTG3-1 [3] and STRESS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN16 ( OsSAP16 ) [15]. The qLTG3-1 gene, encoding a protein of unknown function, has a substantial influence on LTG [3]. During seed germination, qLTG3-1 expression is strongly induced in embryos, which leads to the loosening of the tissues covering the embryo by promoting vacuolation [3]. OsSAP16 encodes a stress-associated protein with two AN1-C2H2 zinc finger domains [15]. OsSAP16 presumably acts as a regulator of LTG. 14-3-3 proteins are regulatory proteins that are widely conserved in eukaryotes. These proteins bind to phosphorylated serine and tyrosine residues in their target proteins that participate in signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression [21, 22], thus altering their enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, stability, or protein–protein interactions [23–25]. The rice genome encodes eight 14-3-3 proteins, named GF14a–h for GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14 [26]. GF14h is involved in rice seed germination under optimal temperature conditions [27, 28]. In addition, GF14h contributes to phytohormone signaling, including abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling [27, 28]. However, it remains unclear whether GF14h promotes seed germination under low-temperature conditions [28]. QTL pyramiding has been proposed as a breeding concept [29] for bringing together several QTLs ( or genes ) related to agronomically important traits in the genetic background of locally adapted elite cultivars. In practice, it is essential to generate pre-breeding materials for QTL pyramiding, i. e., near-isogenic lines ( NILs ) that harbor one or a few genomic segments introgressed from the donor parent into the genome of the recipient parent through a combination of continuous backcrossing and selfing via marker-assisted selection [30]. In this study, we determined that GF14h is responsible for an LTG-related QTL in Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra. We generated a NIL in the background of rice cultivar Hitomebore, which is adapted for growth in northern Japan, by replacing its GF14h genomic fragment with that from Arroz da Terra and tested its LTG performance. 
 We investigated seed germination characteristics of a Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra and a Japanese varieties Iwatekko and Hitomebore. Under low-temperature conditions ( 15°C ), Arroz da Terra exhibited significantly higher germination rates compared to Iwatekko and Hitomebore during days 7−15, particularly showing a 30−40% increase in germination rate 10−11 days after imbibition ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Similarly, at normal temperature conditions ( 25°C ), Arroz da Terra showed superior germination rates 2−4 days after imbibition, especially with a 30% difference observed 3 days after imbibition ( Fig 1A and 1C ). These findings indicate that Arroz da Terra exhibits more vigorous germination under normal and low-temperature conditions than the Japanese cultivars Iwatekko and Hitomebore. To identify the genes responsible for this difference, we searched for QTLs involved in the high LTG of Arroz da Terra. We previously generated a set of 200 RILs at the F7 generation derived from a cross between Arroz da Terra and Iwatekko ( S1 Fig ) [31]. We phenotyped all RILs for LTG at 13°C and selected the 20 RILs with the highest LTG and the 20 RILs with the lowest LTG. We assembled two pools of seedlings with low or high LTG and extracted their genomic DNA for whole-genome sequencing on the Illumina platform ( S1 Fig ) [31]. We mapped the resulting sequencing reads to the Nipponbare rice reference genome ( IRGSP-1. 0 ) and performed QTL-seq analysis using our new high-performance pipeline [32]. Based on the Δ ( SNP-index ), we identified three QTLs related to LTG on chromosome 3 ( qLTG3-1 and qLTG3-2 ) and chromosome 11 ( qLTG11 ) ( Fig 1D ), which is consistent with the results of a previous study [31]. The qLTG3-1 region contained the gene Os03g0103300, which was reported to be involved in LTG in a study using rice cultivar Italica Livorno, which has high LTG, and Hayamasari, which has low LTG [3]. An examination of its coding sequences in Arroz da Terra, as well as Iwatekko and Hitomebore, revealed that they were identical to those found in Italica Livorno and Hayamasari, respectively ( S2 Fig ). While Italica Livorno harbored a functional haplotype for this gene, Hayamasari carried a loss-of-function haplotype due to a 71-bp deletion ( S2 Fig ) [3]. Therefore, we propose that the causal gene for the QTL LTG3-1 is Os03g0103300. To evaluate the contribution of the two other QTLs to LTG, we generated NILs harboring a segment from the Arroz da Terra genome for each QTL ( approximately 5 Mb ) in the Hitomebore background ( Figs 1E, S3A and S4A ). We detected no clear effect of qLTG3-2 on LTG, as qLTG3-2-NIL and Hitomebore showed similar seed germination rates at 15°C ( S4B Fig ). By contrast, qLTG11-NIL showed a significantly higher rate of germination than Hitomebore 7−12 days after imbibition at 15°C, particularly after 8 and 9 days, showing a difference of more than 40% ( Fig 1E and 1F ), indicating that qLTG11 enhances LTG. qLTG11-NIL seeds also germinated more rapidly than Hitomebore seeds under normal conditions ( 25°C ), although with a smaller difference between the two genotypes than at low temperature ( S5 Fig ). We therefore focused our analysis on qLTG11. To identify the gene responsible for qLT11, we narrowed down the qG11 region to a 52-kb interval ( Fig 1G ) containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination ( Fig 1H ). The Arroz Terra GFh allele encodes functional GFh whereas Hitb harbors a 4-b deletion in the coding region ( S Fig 1 ). We generated a NIL in the Hitb background carrying the Arroz Terra GFh fragment ( Figs 1 and S5 ) and tested its LT performance. The NIL showed superior LT compared to Hitb ( Fig 1 and 1 ), indicating that GFh is the causal gene behind qLT11. To confirm this, we knocked out GFh in a NIL carrying the Ar da allele in the Hitb background ( Figs 1 and S ) and overexpressed GFh in Hitb ( Figs 1 and S ). Knocking out GFh decreased LT, whereas overexpressing GFh increased LT ( Fig 1 and 1 ). These results demonstrate that GFh is the gene responsible for qLT11. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed that the functional GFh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding ( S Fig 6 ). We generated a NIL in Hitb carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz Terra including GFh ( Figs 1 and S ) which showed superior LT compared to Hitb with otherwise comparable agronomic traits ( Fig 1 and 1 ). The GFh from Arroz Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.

    Article: Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR, or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ). It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation. To address these questions, a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the sequence of 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ). The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels. Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study, we found that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1. Additionally, we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses. The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5’ and 3’ flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle. 
 Human hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by hepatitis B virus ( HBV ), which can cause chronic infection and puts people at high-risk occurrence of cirrhosis and deadly hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. 296 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B in 2019, with an estimated 820, 000 deaths and 1. 5 million new infections each year [2]. While hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination, individuals who are already chronically infected with HBV are difficult to cure [3]. HBV is the prototype member of the Hepadnaviridae family and a para-retrovirus that replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encoded by viral covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ), which is the persistent form of HBV genome and the authentic transcription template in HBV-infected hepatocyte [4]. Currently approved HBV therapies with nucleos ( t ) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NUCs ) and/or interferon-alpha ( IFNα ) can effectively reduce virus load and slow down disease progression but fail to eliminate the viral infection, specifically the cccDNA, in the majority of treated patients [5]. Although various compounds targeting different steps of HBV life cycle have been developed and some have advanced to clinical trials, but similar to NUCs and IFNα, the lack of direct and potent inhibitory effect of those drugs on cccDNA leaves HBV cure still a challenge [6, 7]. HBV cccDNA exists in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes as a chromatin-like minichromosome, which functions to transcribe viral RNAs and supports viral replication [8, 9]. The persistence of a functional cccDNA pool is responsible for treatment failure and viral rebound after the treatment withdrawal [10–12]. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying cccDNA biosynthesis, maintenance and transcription regulation is essential for development of novel antiviral therapeutics to cure chronic hepatitis B [9, 12–16]. Unlike host chromosomal DNA and other viruses with double-stranded circular DNA genomes such as papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses [17, 18], the authentic HBV cccDNA does not undergo semi-conservative replication but is only converted from viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) during de novo infection and/or via the intracellular amplification pathway ( also known as ( aka ) rcDNA recycling pathway ) [4, 19, 20]. The rcDNA is a 3. 2 kb partially double-stranded open circular viral DNA genome within the mature capsid and virion particles, and it is the major final product from reverse transcribing the pgRNA template catalyzed by viral polymerase ( Pol ) [21–23] ( Fig 1 ). To date, the molecular mechanism by which rcDNA is converted into cccDNA is still not fully understood. Comparing the major differences between rcDNA and cccDNA ( Fig 1A ), a series of biological reactions are required to correct the molecular peculiarities on rcDNA termini during cccDNA formation, including 1 ) completion of positive ( + ) strand DNA synthesis; 2 ) removal of the 5’ end capped RNA primer on ( + ) strand DNA; 3 ) removal of viral Pol covalently attached to the 5’ end of negative ( - ) strand DNA; 4 ) removal of one copy of the terminal redundancy ( TR, or r ) on ( - ) strand DNA; 5 ) ligation of both strands to generate the bona fide cccDNA [13, 14]. Among them, the 8–9 nucleotide ( nt ) -long TR on ( - ) strand DNA is a duplication of nt 1820/1821 ( transcription initiation sites ) to nt 1828 ( reverse transcription initiation site ) reversed transcribed from the pgRNA template, and the 5’ TR is covalently linked to Pol as a result of protein-primed DNA synthesis [19, 21]. However, the ( + ) strand DNA only contains one complementary copy of TR as its internal sequence, indicating a template selection of TR during ( + ) strand DNA synthesis. Since only one copy of TR will form duplex with ( + ) strand DNA at the cohesive end region of rcDNA, it remains unclear whether TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap-like structure on rcDNA and which copy of TR is discarded during cccDNA formation ( Fig 1B ). A previous study introduced mutations into the 5’ terminus of duck hepatitis B virus ( DHBV ) rcDNA ( - ) strand and the sequence analysis of mutant virus-derived rcDNA and cccDNA revealed that in a high frequency ( ~ 85% ), the ( + ) strand DNA synthesis used the mutated 5’ TR as template; and the mutant 5’ TR sequence was largely replaced by wild type ( wt ) 3’ TR sequence in cccDNA, indicating a preferential removal of mutant 5’ TR of rcDNA during DHBV cccDNA formation [24]. However, given the different viral DNA sequences and host cell background between DHBV and HBV, whether the above findings from DHBV mutagenesis study also apply to HBV remains unexplored. It is generally acknowledged that HBV relies on host DNA repair machinery to convert rcDNA into cccDNA and recent studies in this direction have identified a handful of cellular DNA repair factors and viral DNA intermediates involved in cccDNA biosynthesis ( reviewed in [12, 19, 20] ). Among them, a deproteinated rcDNA ( DP-rcDNA, or protein-free rcDNA ) species, which is devoid of the covalently attached Pol at 5’ end of ( - ) strand DNA, has been previously identified and suggested as an intermediate during cccDNA formation [25–30]. The in-depth analyses of cytoplasmic DP-rcDNA termini revealed that both copies of TR sequence remain intact on rcDNA, indicating that the removal of one copy of TR occurs after the import of DP-rcDNA into nucleus [31]. Furthermore, a closed minus-strand rcDNA ( CM-rcDNA ), which possesses a covalently closed ( - ) strand containing single copy of TR but an unligated ( + ) strand, has been discovered as a minor species of DP-rcDNA population via exonuclease digestion, indicating that the TR excision and ( - ) strand ligation may take place prior to the completion of ( + ) strand DNA repair during cccDNA formation [32, 33]. Despite the unavailability of an exact topological information of the putative terminal flap structure on HBV rcDNA, previous studies, likely inspired by the aforementioned DHBV study [24], have demonstrated that the 5’ flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 ( FEN1 ) plays a role in HBV cccDNA production in cell-based phenotypic assays and in in vitro biochemical assays using synthetic rcDNA substrates with a preset 5’ flap structure [34, 35]. However, chemical inhibition or siRNA knockdown ( ~80% efficiency ) of FEN1 only partially reduced cccDNA formation ( ≤50% ) in HBV cell culture models [34], inferring that additional viral and/or cellular endonucleases may be involved in cDNA biosynthesis. In this study, we established a HB cell line Hep-C2G182G with a C182G mutation in the pgRNA sequence altering the 3’ TR ( ) of ( ) DNA while the 5 TR remained wild type ( wt ). The production of HB rcDNA and cDNA in Hep-C182G2 cells was comparable to wild-type ( wt ) levels Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( ) DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cDNA predominantly carried wt182 residue indicating the 5 TR of ( ) DNA serves as template during rcDNA forming duplex with ( ) DNA while the 3 TR forms a flap-like structure which is removed during cDNA formation In a survey of cellular endonucleases using loss-of-function study we found that 3’ endonucase Mus81 plays a role in cDNA formation in wild-type HB replicating cells alongside 5 endonuc F1 Additionally, we mapped Mus and F1 cleavage sites within TR of DP-rc by RACE-NG analyses The overlapping between Mus and F1 in cDNA indicates the putative 5 and 3 formed by TR are dynamically on rcDNA These findings shed light on HB rcDNA and cDNA mechanisms contributing our understanding HB replication.

    Title: 
    Article: The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ), methanogens ( MET ), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments. 
 Microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) are an ideal technological solution to support zero-waste practices within the concept of a circular economy [1]. This technology exploits microbial activities to extract electrons from the breakdown of waste biomass. These electrons can be released to anode electrode and then flow to cathode electrode for completing the circuit and generating electricity [2]. MFCs offer distinct advantages over existing green technologies such as anaerobic digestion, including the ability to directly convert organic wastes into electricity, the capability to remove toxic residues, and the production of less-polluting effluents [3]. Thus, MFCs can complement the anaerobic digestion process or serve as an alternative green technology for waste treatment across diverse industries [4]. A recent study on the application of MFCs in wastewater treatment systems within the canned-pineapple industry underlines the practicality of this technology in real-world scenarios. The MFCs system showed great performances in chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) removal, sulfide removal, and in current generation with organic- and sulfide-containing wastewater [5]. Nonetheless, the performance of MFCs is often hindered by microbial activity destabilization when exposed to fluctuating conditions of real-world industrial operations [6]. The variable nature of organic substrates in wastewater profoundly influences the microbial dynamics within MFCs, including the composition, metabolic functions, and interrelationships among microbial guilds, thereby ultimately impacting their performance. Different waste characteristics favor the growth of specific microbial species, causing a shift in microbial profiles and composition [7]. Moreover, microorganisms do not live in isolation but interact through substrate-product exchanges. This exchange of metabolites known as “metabolic cross-feeding” drives intricate interactions between microbes, which finally modulate the convolution of the microbial community [8–10]. While there is extensive research on how microbial species influence each other and the sensitivity of microbial communities to environmental conditions, our current understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying these interactions and variations remains limited. Microbial species in MFCs typically cooperate through mutualistic interactions ( i. e., syntrophic relationship ), where they rely on each other for survival and perform complementary roles in converting organic matter into electricity. Complex carbon compounds are primarily digested into smaller carbon molecules, such as volatile fatty acids ( VFAs ), ethanol, acetate, and hydrogen ( H2 ), by organic-hydrolyzing and organic-fermenting microbes. These molecules are subsequently oxidized by exoelectrogenic bacteria ( EB ), which are capable of performing extracellular electron transfer to produce electricity [11]. In sulfur-rich environments, sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ) play a major role in metabolizing sulfate and larger carbon molecules. This metabolism results in the production of smaller carbon e. g. VFAs, which support the growth of various bacteria, including sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ), which utilize VFAs and, in turn, provide sulfate as a substrate for SRB [12, 13]. Additionally, prevalence of specific substrates such as acetate, formate, and H2 in MFCs tend to favor methanogenic bacteria ( MET ) [14, 15]. Growth of MET helps scavenge the remaining substrates, thus maintaining COD removal efficiency [16]. The interactions among microbial guilds are highly dynamic and largely affected by the surrounding environment, including substrate availability and concentration [17, 18]. These conditions pose an even higher challenge in pursuing a comprehensive study and manipulation of MFCs performance. Wastewater characteristics, including substrate type, concentration, and pH vastly influence microbial interactions and composition within MFCs. Different types of organic substrates can selectively support the growth and activity of distinct microbial species. For example, acetate-fed MFCs exhibited a high abundance of Geobacter species, while glucose-fed MFCs favored the prevalence of Clostridium and Bacillus bacteria [10, 19]. Besides substrate species, the composition of each individual organic compounds in the industrial wastewater varies with the production seasons, and these fluctuations alter the organic loading rate ( OLR ) to MFCs. Studies have shown that an increase in OLR in MFCs can lead to a decline in electricity generation. This deterioration is likely due to the invasion of MET, which compete against EB in MFCs [15, 16]. Changes in substrate types and concentration, coupled with the MFC system operation, impact the pH levels in the reactor chamber. This pH alteration critically disrupts the equilibrium of the microbial community and the performance of the system. An acidic environment can decrease the overall growth rate of the microbial community, impacting electricity generation. In addition, it can alter the overall activity and structure of the microbial community as different species may respond variably to pH changes, leading to alterations in their behavior and organization within the community [20, 21]. In real-world situations, the equilibrium of microbial interactions faces challenges from multiple influential factors. These combined factors increase the complexity of the interrelationships between species. The intricate and diverse relationships among microbial species and their surrounding environments prevent in-depth investigation of metabolic cross-feeding in MFCs. While metabolic flux analysis using 13C labeling can precisely track microbial metabolism [22], it has limitations in capturing the multitude of metabolite exchanges within microbial populations. Moreover, metabolic flux analysis is primarily applicable in synthetic laboratory settings [23–25]. To address these challenges, mathematical modeling has been introduced to study microbe-microbe interactions in MFCs [25–28]. Artificial intelligence ( AI ) -based modeling is a powerful approach to accommodate a large number of microbial species that are involved in the scope of study [26], whereas metabolic modeling is a niche approach to gain comprehensive insights underlying the association of microbial species in a community [25, 28]. In particular, the genome-scale metabolic models ( GEMs ) of microbial communities created using Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) framework [29] allow the observation of mechanistic scenarios of microbial interactions under any studied conditions that are not restricted to the realm of empirical experiments [30–33]. The GEMs approach is typically conceived as an integrated compartmental model to represent the fundamental metabolic process generated by the entire microbial community, or as a compartmentalized model to mimic the complementation and restriction inter-relationships between individual metabolic processes provided by the community members [34]. Previous studies of the compartmentalized GEMs demonstrate the ideality of the conceptual framework for examining how the microbial structure as a whole may adapt to changing conditions due to modified interactions between microorganisms. The multi-species GEM was initially adopted to deepen understanding of the commensal relationship between SRB and MET in a co-culture experiment, where hydrogen exchange was found to be a key metabolic cross-feeding that supports their syntrophic growth [35, 36]. The approach has been improved in a number of ways to enable the simulation of the complex connections between microbial species in the real-world situation, for examples incorporation of microbial ecology constraints [37], contextualization of community dynamics through integration of omics data [38], and inclusion of spatial and temporal effects on microbial interactions and composition under dynamic environments [39–41]. Despite significant progress, the compartmentalized GEMs model still faces challenges in maximizing the number of community members in model coverage and minimizing computational load resulting from the large number of complexly associated components in order to arrive at a mathematically plausible solution. Addressing these challenges would improve the model’s representation of community-level scenarios. In this work, we aimed to address a critical gap in the practical implementation of industrial MFCs by focusing on understanding the dynamics of microbial communities under changing operating conditions, particularly an increase in the OLR. We postulated that microbial interactions, specifically metabolic cross-feeding through substrate-product exchange, would be disrupted during elevated OLR conditions. This disruption might favor different microbial guilds over others, impacting MFC performance. We developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale model ( mmEM ) based on metabolic crossfeeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFC treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pine factory. The model encompassed three major guilds SR, MET, and SO. Our findings revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as OLR increased along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low OLR ( L-OL ) and adaptation to high OLR ( H-OL ) The simulations revealed constraints SO growth under H-OL due to reduced-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More-fed metabolites from SR were diverted to MET facilitating their dominance. Assessing crossfeeding under OLR enabled execution of scenario-based simulations to explore the impact of elevated levels on SO growth and MFC. This work highlights the role of metabolic in shaping community response to OLR. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC in real-world environments.

    Title: 
    Article: Machine learning ( ML ) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate ( FDR ) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited. 
 Machine learning ( ML ) algorithms have proven to be transformative tools for generating biological hypotheses and uncovering knowledge from large datasets [1, 2]. Applications include designing function-enhanced proteins [3, 4], searching for novel drug molecules [5], and optimizing human antibodies against new viral variants [6]. These discoveries often involve a combination of computation and experimentation, where ML-based predictive models generate biological hypotheses and wet-lab experiments are then used to validate them. This approach is beneficial as it greatly reduces the search space and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to be successful, thus saving time and resources in the discovery process. For example, in drug discovery, ML has become a popular strategy for virtual screening of molecule libraries, where researchers use ML models to predict the properties of molecules, such as binding affinity to a target, and identify the most promising candidates for downstream experimental validation and lead optimization [7]. To gain new insights into biological systems or make novel discoveries ( e. g., designing new drugs ), ML algorithms are often used to make predictions for previously unseen data samples. For example, to support the design of new vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19, ML algorithms need to predict the potential for immune escape of future variants that are composed of mutations that have not yet been seen. Similarly, in drug screening, ML algorithms should be able to predict molecules that are structurally different from those in the training data, which helps scientists avoid re-discovering existing drugs. However, making predictions for samples that are under-represented in the training data is a challenging task in ML. While human experts can assess the success likelihood of generated hypotheses based on their domain knowledge or intuition, this ability is not naturally developed by an ML model and, as a result, the model could be susceptible to pathological failure and only provide overconfident or unreliable predictions. This can have critical implications in ML-assisted biological discovery, as unreliable ML predictions can guide experimental efforts in the wrong direction, wasting resources on validating false positives. In this work, we aim to develop ML models that can generate hypotheses with limited false positives, providing confident and accurate predictions that can potentially help improve the yield rate in downstream validation experiments. Specifically, we use the function annotation problem of protein enzymes as an example to demonstrate our method. The underlying computational problem of function annotation is a multi-class, multi-label classification problem as a protein can have multiple functions. In computational protein function annotation, a model typically predicts a set of functions that the query protein may potentially have. The set of predicted functions, if validated by experiments, can be incorporated into existing databases to augment our knowledge of the protein function space. There is often a trade-off regarding the size of the prediction set: researchers prefer a set with a small size, containing a handful of very confident predictions, as it is not desirable to spend resources on too many hypotheses that ultimately turn out to be false positives; on the other hand, researchers may be willing to increase the budget to validate a larger set of predictions in order to improve the chance of discovering novel functions for under-studied proteins. The above tradeoff is often captured by different notions of prediction score cutoff, which decides whether to assign a particular function label to a protein, in existing computational methods for function annotation. For example, when annotating protein functions using sequence-similarity-based tools such as BLAST [8], a cutoff of the BLAST E-value can be used to determine the significance of sequence match. However, the choice of E-value cutoff is often based on the user’s intuition and good cutoff values on a dataset may not generalize to another dataset. Recent ML methods for enzyme function annotation typically first predict the probability that the input protein has a particular function and annotate the protein with this function if the predicted probability is greater than 0. 5 [9–11]. However, using an arbitrary cutoff such as 0. 5 is problematic as the predicted probabilities do not always translate to the confidence of the ML model, especially when the model is not well-calibrated ( e. g., a predicted function with probability 0. 95 may still be an unreliable prediction if the model is overconfident and produces very high probability scores most of the time ). Recently, Hie et al. [12] developed a framework that used the Gaussian process to estimate the confidence or uncertainty in the ML model’s predictions. While the framework was shown to be effective to guide biological discovery, it is unclear how the estimated uncertainty is related to the final false discovery rate ( FDR ) in experimental validation and how to set a cutoff on the uncertainty scores to achieve a desired FDR. Consequently, it is challenging to provide FDR estimates before the experimental validation, and FDR typically can only be assessed post-validation. Here, we propose an ML method, called CPEC ( Conformal Prediction of EC number ), to achieve FDR-controlled enzyme function prediction by leveraging a statistical framework known as conformal prediction ( CP ) [13]. CPEC receives the sequence or structure of an enzyme as input and predicts a set of functions ( EC numbers ) that the enzyme potentially has. The unique strength of CPEC is that the averaged per-protein FDR ( i. e., the number of incorrect predictions divided by the prediction set size for a protein ) can be controlled by a user-specified hyper-parameter α. The CP framework theoretically guarantees that the FDR of our per-protein predictions is no larger than α with a very high probability. This equips researchers with foresight, offering success rate estimates even before experimental validation. In an ML-guided workflow of protein function discovery, researchers can specify the desired FDR level α based on the experiment budget or expectations. For example, setting α to a smaller value when only the most confident predictions are needed or the test budget is limited, or setting to a larger value when the goal is to discover novel functions and a slightly higher FDR and budget are acceptable. The base ML model of CPEC is PenLight2, an improved version of the deep learning model PenLight [14] for the multi-class multi-label protein function annotation problem, which uses a graph neural network to integrate 3D protein structure data and protein language model embeddings to learn structure-aware representations for function prediction. Benchmarked on a carefully curated dataset, we first found that CPEC outperformed existing deep learning methods for enzyme function prediction. We also demonstrated that CPEC provides rigorous guarantees of FDR and allows users to trade-off between precision and recall in the predictions by tuning the desired maximum value α of FDR. Additionally, we showed that CPEC consistently provides FDR-controlled predictions for proteins with different sequence identities to the training set, suggesting its robustness even in regimes beyond its training data distribution. Moreover, based on CPEC, we proposed a cascade model that can better balance the resolution and coverage for EC number prediction. 
 Protein function prediction, such as Gene Ontology ( GO ) term [15] prediction [16] and EC number [17] prediction, can be formulated as a multi-class, multi-label classification problem, where each protein can have multiple ground-truth labels. For the set of all possible proteins X and the ground truth label set Y = { 1, …, K }, an ML model f : X ↦ [ 0, 1 ] K for protein function prediction predicts the probability of the input protein X ∈ X having each function label k ∈ {1, …, K}. In application, a decision threshold parameter λ is often needed to generate the final prediction set C λ ( X ) = { k ∈ Y : f k ( X ) ≥ λ }. Instead of choosing an arbitrary constant cutoff ( e. g., λ = 0. 5 ), conformal prediction ( CP ), also known as conformal risk control, uses a small set of calibration data to select a valid parameter λ that would satisfy rigorous statistical guarantees for model mistakes on test data, based on the user-defined risk tolerance. As false discovery rate ( FDR ) reflects how much proportion of the experimental validation of ML prediction results would be unsuccessful, it is directly related to the gains out of the wet lab experiments as opposed to the experimental costs, which is a tradeoff researchers often need to confront with. Therefore, it is desirable to have a method to control the FDR before experimental validation. Conformal prediction provides a framework to control the FDR by selecting a parameter λ such that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level α with high probability. In CPEC, we use conform prediction to control the FDR of the set of predicted functions for a protein, where the set is generated by the ML model PenLight2. Conform prediction is based on the idea that if the model is well-calibrated, the probability of a protein having a particular function should be close to the proportion of proteins in the calibration set that have that function. In other words, if the model is well-calibrated, the proportion of proteins in the calibration set that have function k should be close to f k ( X ), where f is the predicted probability of protein X having function k. In CPEC, we use a calibration set of proteins with known functions to compute the proportion of proteins that have each function k and compare it to the predicted probability f ( X ). If the two are close, the model is considered well-calibrated for function k and the prediction is included in the set. If not, the model is not well-calibrated for k and the prediction is not included in the set. This process is repeated for all functions and the set of functions is generated. The proportion of incorrect predictions in the set is then compared to the desired FDR α to determine if the set is valid. If the proportion is larger than α, the set is rejected and a new set is generated. This process is repeated until the desired FDR is achieved. The strength of CPEC is that the per-protein FDR can be controlled by the user-specified hyperparameter α and the framework guarantees that the FDR will not exceed α with high probability. This allows researchers to set the desired FDR before experimental and have foresight on the success rate of validation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CPEC using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery of functions of less-characterized enzymes. C integrates a deep model with conform prediction providing accurate and F-controlled predictions for given enzyme. Conform prediction provides rigorous guarantees to the model and ensures the expected F will not exceed user-specified with high. Evaluation show that C achieves reliable F control better or comparable performance at F than existing methods and accurate for enzymes underrepresented in the data. We expect C to be useful for biological applications where high yield in experiments is desired but the budget is limited.

    Title: 
    Article: Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ). Mutations in TARDBP, the gene coding for TDP-43, can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ), indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes; alternatively, TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell. The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation; however, it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo. Using a C. elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy, we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16. 1, and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16. 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43. We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS. 
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a highly disabling disease characterized by the progressive loss of upper cortical and lower spinal motor neurons. Loss of motor neurons is accompanied by muscle denervation, causing weakness, spasticity, and finally, paralysis, which can lead to fatal respiratory failure typically within 3–5 years after diagnosis [1]. Most patients with ALS have a sporadic form of the disease with no known genetic cause. However, there are currently more than 30 gene mutations thought to cause familial inherited forms of ALS [2]. Similar to other neurodegenerative proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, ALS exhibits accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in disease affected regions of the central nervous system [3]. The vast majority of both sporadic and familial ALS-diagnosed cases ( about 97% ) present inclusions containing the protein TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa ( TDP-43 ) in degenerating neurons, thus constituting the main pathological hallmark of the disease. TDP-43 is an essential protein contributing to many aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing regulation and RNA processing [4]. TDP-43 protein levels are tightly controlled through a negative feedback loop, in which TDP-43 recognizes its own RNA transcript and destabilizes it, thus reducing TDP-43 protein production [5]. Under physiological conditions, this protein resides primarily in the nucleus but can be transported into the cytoplasm, where it contributes to RNA stability and transport. ALS-associated TDP-43 accumulates as insoluble inclusions in neurons and other central nervous system cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, thus contributing to neuronal dysfunction and interfering in myelin regeneration [6, 7]. Within these inclusions, TDP-43 exhibits a variety of post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, disulfide bridge formation, and sumoylation [8]. Of these, phosphorylation is used diagnostically to identify TDP-43 pathology in disease. Accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 not only results in a loss of normal nuclear functions of TDP-43 but can disrupt its autoregulation and protein turnover mechanisms [5]. Neuronal health relies on maintenance of TDP-43 protein levels. In support of this, both autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ) have been implicated in normal TDP-43 homeostasis and in disease [9–11]. While autophagy clears misfolded, insoluble or aggregated proteins from the cell, the UPS primarily controls degradation of unfolded polypeptides, which must be capable of entering into the proteasome. Soluble TDP-43 is preferentially degraded through the UPS, although the UPS can also clear disaggregated pathological TDP-43 [12, 13]. The Hsp90 family encompasses a heterogeneous group of phylogenetically highly conserved molecular chaperones acting as a key player in the regulation of degradation of misfolded proteins [14–17]. In humans, this family includes two cytosolic Hsp90 members ( HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 ), one specifically located in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( HSP90B1 ), and one mitochondrial resident ( TRAP1 ) [18]. HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 can be localized in the nucleus [18–20] as part of their chaperone role facilitating the transport of certain cargos, like steroid receptors [21]. In C. elegans there is only one cytosolic Hsp90 homolog, hsp-90 ( also called daf-21 ) [22, 23], one ER resident ( enpl-1 ), and one mitochondrial family member ( hsp-75 ) [24, 25]. Mammalian Hsp90 is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system and participates in a variety of cellular processes including cell signaling, cytoskeleton integrity maintenance, proteasome maintenance, and cell cycle [18, 26]. Through its chaperone activities, it functions with a network of co-chaperones to regulate both de novo synthesized and incorrectly folded client protein folding. Hsp90 plays a crucial role in the quality control of proteins, including preventing protein misfolding or assisting in protein degradation in order to counteract protein aggregation [27, 28]. Hsp90 is highly expressed, representing about 1% of the total cellular proteins in eukaryotes [29, 30], and its activity is tightly regulated by its interaction with other chaperones and co-chaperones. Under stress conditions, Hsp90 works together with the chaperone Hsp70 to form an essential part of the cellular quality control system and one of the main lines of defense against misfolded proteins through a co-chaperone-dependent process, including the co-chaperones STI-1/HOP [16, 31] and CHIP [16, 31–33]. In C. elegans, hsp-90 participates in a broad variety of processes. During development, it is expressed preferentially in germ cell progenitors, playing a role in reproduction. In addition to expression in cell types including neurons, muscle, and the intestine, HSP-90 is present in germ line cells in adulthood, corroborating its role controlling C. elegans reproduction [34]. As in mammals, it participates in cell division, cell proliferation, and muscle proteostasis [35–37]. Moreover, HSP-90 can function as a life span regulator by controlling DAF-16 isoform A nuclear import [38]. HSP-90 is also involved in sensory cilia, where it contributes to the normal chemosensory signal transduction, which is essential for survival [39, 40]. HSP-90 also has important roles in protein quality control in C. elegans. Under stress conditions, perinuclear HSP-90 protects newly synthesized proteins from denaturation or from being degraded by the cell stress response in somatic cells [35]; moreover, this protective role against chronic proteotoxic stress functions as an integrated organismal response in a cell non-autonomous manner [41]. While molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 have been studied in ALS [31], a full understanding of their roles remains unclear. Evidence exists that molecular chaperones can function both as protectors against the toxicity associated with protein misfolding and as enhancers of disease that maintain the stability of the toxic form of TDP-43 [31]. For example, Hsp90 inhibition reduces TDP-43 levels in an autophagy-dependent mechanism in HeLa cell models [42]. In contrast, another model of TDP-43 proteinopathy generated in human neuroblastoma cells found the knockdown of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones leads to an accumulation of toxic TDP-43 species, potentially by blocking the degradation pathways in which these chaperones are involved [12]. However, consequences of Hsp90 inhibition have not been tested in vivo, in the context of an intact nervous system. In this study, we explore the role of the C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 chaperone in an animal model of TDP-43 proteinopathy that expresses full length human TDP-43 containing ALS-causing mutations pan-neuronally. We found that disrupting HSP-90 functions genetically or with small molecule inhibitors is sufficient to protect against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. 
 Hsp90 is an essential gene, and complete loss of function of Hsp90 is embryonic lethal in C. elegans [22, 43]. Therefore, we used RNA interference ( RNAi ) to knockdown hsp-90 in adult animals expressing mutant T-43. We found that h-90 knockdown significantly reduced T-43 protein levels and phosphorylated T-43 in the nervous system. We also found that h-90 knockdown protected against T-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. The protective effect of h-90 was accompanied by upregulation of key stress responsive heat shock genes, including h-70 and h-16. 1, which are known to interact with H-90 [44, 45]. We found that normal levels of h-16.1 are required for the protective effect of h-90 on T-43. Moreover, we observed that the neuroprotective effect of h-90 does not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate for the first time that H-90 chaper activity contributes to outcomes in T-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.

    Title: 
    Article: Our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system and the extent of their conservation is currently very limited. This is due to the focus on model systems, including Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the observed diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex chromosome systems. We use single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system. We map our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, shedding light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species. We identify the major cell types known to be present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells. Additionally, we use the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and allowing us to explore the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. 
 Most animals have evolved sexually dimorphic mechanisms and tissues dedicated to the production of haploid gametes through meiosis ( gametogenesis ). Males produce motile nuclei ( sperm ) through spermatogenesis, which takes place in the testes. Females produce oocytes that contain a haploid nucleus along with the cytoplasmic molecules needed to initiate and facilitate embryonic development through oogenesis, which takes place in the ovaries [1]. While many aspects of oogenesis and female meiosis are highly conserved between distant species, there is considerable diversity in many others, including the presence/absence of nurse cells, meiotic chromosome pairing strategies, recombination rates, timing and duration of meiotic arrests, and sex chromosome specific regulation [1–3]. Why such a fundamental and ancient mechanism exhibits so much variation is still unclear. Studying species with diverse body plans, reproductive modes, and sex chromosome systems at the genetic and molecular levels will help elucidate the developmental constraints and selective pressures that shaped the evolution of the conserved, convergent and divergent features of oogenesis. As the hallmark of oogenesis, meiosis is very tightly regulated and many mechanisms have evolved to ensure the faithful transmission of genetic information to the offspring through the proper pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes [4]. In addition to ensuring the fidelity of the transmitted genome copy and building the maternal reserves to kick-start the embryo’s journey, oogenesis involves extensive reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape to ensure a successful oocyte-to-embryo transition upon fertilization [5]. To accomplish those feats, oocytes actively navigate previtellogenesis and the majority of prophase I before they arrest and become transcriptionally quiescent. The prophase I arrest is thought to be essential for oocyte growth and differentiation, and is conserved across metazoans, but with highly variable durations [6]. In many arthropods, the lack of transcription in the oocyte is buffered by the activity of nurse cells that remain connected to the oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges [7]. Sister cyst cells have been shown to play a similar role in mice, suggesting they might also be important for mammalian oocyte differentiation [8]. In addition to this buffering, work in Drosophila suggests that some oocyte specific transcription, regulated through epigenetic programming in early oogenesis, occurs before the resumption of meiosis [9]. This, along with the findings that oocyte chromatin enrichments of H4K16ac and H3K27me3 are maintained in the oocyte-to-embryo transitions in Drosophila and mammals, highlights the importance of the epigenetic regulation in early oogenesis [10–12]. Somatic-germ cell signaling is also known to play an important role in oogenesis, where in Drosophila and mammals, signaling, often hormonal, by the surrounding follicle cells plays an important role in triggering oocyte maturation [13, 14]. Despite our understanding of some of the pathways involved, many questions still surround the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling involved in oocyte differentiation, maturation and the resumption of meiosis after the long arrest, including their relative contribution, how they evolved in the first place, and how conserved they are across metazoans. The presence of differentiated/heteromorphic sex chromosomes, such as the X and Y pair of mammals, introduces two challenges: First, X-linked genes are found in different copy numbers between males and females, which can cause imbalances in expression; second, sequence similarity is usually required for successful synapsis and accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes, but is lacking over most of the length of the XY pair. Dosage compensation mechanisms have evolved to tackle the first problem, with some species, such as Drosophila, upregulating the expression of the single X in males, and others, such as mammals, inactivating one of the X chromosomes in females [15]. This sex chromosome-specific epigenetic regulation seems to disappear/reverse in the germline cells of Drosophila males [16, 17] and undergo extensive reconfiguration in mammalian females, with a period of hyper-transcription before reaching dosage balance ( X:A ~ 1 ) [18, 19]. It is not clear whether this absence of dosage compensation in the germline is linked to the epigenetic reprogramming that takes place during gametogenesis, and whether it is the rule or the exception in Arthropods. The second problem is germline specific, as the sex chromosomes fail to synapse across some or most of their length during prophase I [20]. Asynapsis of other chromosomes triggers germ cell arrest as a defense mechanism against genome instability and aneuploidy [21, 22], and mechanisms must be in place to ensure that meiotic cells pass this checkpoint in the presence of unpaired sex chromosomes. This has been extensively studied in mammalian spermatogenesis, where the non-recombining regions of the XY chromosomes fail to pair and remain unsynapsed during meiotic prophase I [23]. This leads to the accumulation of repressive chromatin marks and silencing along the two sex chromosomes. The XY chromatin condenses and forms what is called the sex body ( XY body ), which is inaccessible to the transcription machinery [24, 25], leading to the complete silencing of both chromosomes. This process is termed meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ), and it has been described in marsupials, eutherians, nematodes, beetles, chickens, and fruit flies, with the latter two cases being disputed afterwards [26–29, 22, 30]. In the case of fruit flies, a recent study showed that the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster is not enriched for silencing marks in spermatocytes, suggesting the absence of MSCI [31]. Another study used single-cell RNA-seq in Drosophila miranda, which has the ancestral Drosophila X ( Muller element A ), along with two younger X-linked chromosome arms ( Muller AD and Muller C ), found that all three X chromosomes have expression patterns consistent with a lack of dosage compensation in late spermatocytes and spermatids [32]. The presence of MSCI in some but not all organisms with differentiated XY chromosomes raises the question of what drives it to evolve in the first place, and what alternative mechanisms may be in place in species lacking it. Currently, the understanding of the sex chromosome specific regulation and the interplay with the tight constraints of gametogenesis is biased towards model species with XY chromosomes. Species with ZW chromosomes ( females are ZW, males ZZ ) provide an interesting counterpart, as the dosage imbalance and the pairing issues will occur in the female rather than male and during oogenesis rather than spermatogenesis. The status of MSCI in ZW systems is unclear: as after a study reported its presence in the ZW system of chicken during oogenesis [26], another study came to the opposite conclusion [27]. A study of MSCI in two Lepidoptera species reported that the Z is euchromatic and transcriptionally active during meiosis [33]. However, none of these studies quantified transcriptional output directly, and partial reductions in sex chromosome expression may have been missed. Additionally, as dosage compensation mechanisms evolved to mask the deleterious effects of having a single copy of dosage-sensitive genes, imbalances in the germline of heterogametic females should hypothetically have detrimental effects on oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Due to the limited number of studies on ZW systems, whether dosage compensation is present in the germline cells and whether Z-chromosomes are inactivated during oogenesis are still open questions. Here, we address these questions using Artemia brine shrimp, an aquatic arthropod from the Branchiopoda class with a pair of differentiated ZW sex chromosomes [34]. Arthropods have two major types of ovaries: panoistic, where all the germline cells differentiate into oocytes, and meroistic, where only one cell becomes an oocyte and the rest of the germ cells differentiate into nurse cells. Although the majority of crustaceans have panoistic ovaries, meroistic ovaries are typical for Branchiopoda [35]. This facilitates drawing parallels between the Artemia reproductive system and that of Drosophila melanogaster, the most studied insect. We used single-nucle RNA ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive atlas of the Artemia female reproductive system and map our data to the FlyBase single-nucle dataset of Dophila melanogaster ovary. We identify the major cell types present in the Artemia ovary, including germl cells, follicle cells, and muscle cells, and explore the regulation of gene expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis highlighting its unique dynamics and the presence of MSCI in this group. Our results show that the Z chromosome is transcriptionally active during meiosis in Artemia and that dosage compensation is not present in the germl cells. This is the first evidence of MSCI in a species with ZW chromosomes and the first study to quantify transcriptional output of the Z chromosome during meiosis. Our findings suggest that MSCI is a conserved mechanism across different sex chromosome systems and that dosage compensation in the germl is not a universal feature of oogenesis.

    Title: 
    Article: Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom. 
 Here, we describe subcircuit motifs that reflect recent experimental evidence for the structure of dorsal horn laminae I-II networks mediating static allodynia ( as evoked by a von Frey device ) and dynamic allodynia ( Fig 1A ). Experimental studies in rodents have shown that static allodynia is reliant on activity in three putatively different types of laminae I-II excitatory interneurons: somatostatin-positive ( SOM+ ) [16], calretinin-positive ( CR+ ) [19], and protein kinase C γ-positive ( PKCγ+ ) [17] cells. Additionally, inactivation of either dynorphin-positive ( DYN+ ) [16] or parvalbumin-positive ( PV+ ) [17] inhibitory interneurons is sufficient to produce static allodynia, suggesting that these inhibitory cells usually gate activation of SOM+, CR+ and PKCγ+ excitatory cells. Experiments have also identified direct synaptic connections from PV+ to PKCγ+ neurons [17]. Based on these experimental results, we consider a simplified subcircuit motif representing part of the pathway mediating static allodynia that consists of three neural populations ( Fig 1B ). One population, E, represents the collective activity of laminae I-II SOM+, CR+ and PKCγ+ excitatory interneurons. The E population is inhibited by two distinct inhibitory interneuron populations, I1 representing DYN+ cells and I2 representing PV+ cells. All three populations receive input from Aβ fibers, ( as suggested in [16, 19, 21] ), while the E population is presumed to be additionally targeted by C fiber input ( see e. g. [16, 19] ). Rodent experimental studies probing the mechanisms for dynamic allodynia have identified that it relies on the activity of laminae I-II SOM+ excitatory interneurons that do not express the calbindin 2/calretinin gene ( CR- ). Specifically, ablating SOM+ neurons abolishes or greatly reduces dynamic allodynia in mice [18]. On the other hand, ablating neurons expressing the calbindin 2/calretinin gene ( CR+ ) had no effect on dynamic allodynia [18]. Thus, the SOM+ neurons that are necessary for dynamic allodynia must also be negative for calretinin ( SOM+/CR- ). Excitatory interneurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 3 ( VT3+ ) in laminae II-III also contribute to dynamic allodynia since their ablation or silencing eliminates or attenuates dynamic allodynia induced by nerve injury or ablation in mice [18]. Moreover, it has been proposed that the VT3+ neurons synapse onto the excitatory SOM+/CR- neurons [18]. Further experimental results suggest that activity of the VT3+ excitatory interneurons are gated by DYN+ inhibitory neurons since VT3+ neurons fire action potentials in response to Aβ input when inhibitory signaling is blocked [18]. Ablation of DYN+ cells is sufficient to induce dynamic allodynia [16] suggesting that DYN+ inhibitory cells may provide local inhibitory control of these two excitatory interneuron populations involved in dynamic allodynia. To account for these experimental results, we consider a simplified subcircuit representing part of the pathway mediating dynamic allodynia that consists of four neural populations ( Fig 1C ). An excitatory population E2 representing the collective activity of laminae I-II SOM+/CR- excitatory neurons is excited by a population E1 representing in laminae II-III VT3+ neurons. E1 and E2 receive inhibitory input from populations I1 and I2, respectively, representing local DYN+ cells. All populations receive Aβ input, ( as suggested in [16, 18] ), and E2 is presumed to be additionally targeted by C fiber input ( see [18] ). The E population in the static allodynia subcircuit and the E2 population in the dynamic allodynia subcircuit are assumed to provide direct synaptic input to lamina I projection cells that transmit painful signals to the brain [22]. Hence, painful stimuli generating activity on C fibers would activate these excitatory cells and the downstream projection neurons. Under normal healthy conditions, responses of these excitatory populations to non-painful stimuli signaled by Aβ input is assumed to be gated by the inhibitory populations. Allodynia occurs when the E-I balance is disrupted such that non-painful Aβ input causes firing in these excitatory populations, leading to activation of the downstream projection neurons. While allodynia can also be induced by nociceptor-mediated sensitization of projection neurons [20], here we focus on allodynia caused by disruption of inhibitory gating of Aβ input. The goal of this study is to identify and characterize “most likely” potential mechanisms that disrupt the processing of Aβ signals and E-I balance in these subcircuits leading to allodynia. We model the activity and interactions of the neural populations in these subcircuits using a population firing rate model formalism ( see e. g. [23–25] ) constrained by experimental data. We begin by identifying the full space of model parameters that generate responses to Aβ signals that is correlated to healthy conditions in each subcircuit, i. e. low firing of the E or E2 populations. We specifically focus on analyzing effects of synaptic coupling parameters that represent the magnitude of effects of pre-synaptic activity on post-synaptic response. Due to the relative mathematical simplicity of our firing rate model formalism, we are able to analytically define an “allowable parameter space” ( APS ) as a solution to a system of inequalities on model parameters. The APS for each subcircuit indicates the considerable range of parameter combinations that can reproduce healthy responses and demonstrates the myriad ways that E-I balance might be obtained. The population of subcircuits corresponding to the points in the APS represents the high variability in subcircuit structure that may occur physiologically. Next, for each subcircuit, we define the analytic condition on model parameters that generates a response to Aβ input correlated with allodynia, i. e. high firing of the E or E2 populations. Solving this condition defines a hypersurface in the model parameter space, which we call the “allodynia surface”, that separates parameter sets for which the subcircuit generates healthy, allodynia-free responses for all typical Aβ inputs, vs responses where allodynia may be present, ( for at least some typical level of Aβ input ). For model parameter sets ( points ) in the APS, we then identify the minimal change in parameters that leads to allodynia by computing the shortest vector in parameter space from the point in the APS to the allodynia surface. The direction of these shortest vectors, corresponding to changes in specific model parameters, indicates the least variation of the subcircuit structure that results in the allodynia response. Since larger variations in parameter values can also generate an allodynia response, these shortest vectors represent the “most likely” potential mechanisms for allodynia to occur. We then analyze the directions of the shortest vectors from the APS to the allodynia surface to identify distinct variations of parameters that dysregulate E-I balance leading to allodynia. Specifically, we find that the shortest vector directions form clusters based on the parameters requiring the relatively smallest changes to reach the allodynia surface. These different clusters can be interpreted as representing different underlying mechanisms of allody. For each cluster, we identify the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism and the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control or upregulation of excitatory responses that excitatory “escape” inhibitory control. The proportion of subcircuits exhibiting each mechanism varies depending on the subircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about mechanisms that may be most responsible for allody, offering predictions for the interindividual variability in allody and targets for further studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain.

    Title: 
    Article: Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7. We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2. The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1. Further, mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1. In contrast, yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2. Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding, but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. In addition, these results provide further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones. 
 The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for maintaining up to 20% of the yeast proteome in an active, folded conformation [1–5]. Hsp90 functions as a dimer and undergoes dramatic nucleotide-induced conformational changes [6]. The most complete model of Hsp90 function is based on the ATP-dependent cycle of interaction with glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) [7–10]. Unfolded GR progresses through a loading complex consisting of Hsp70, Hsp90, and Sti1/Hop to a mature complex of GR, Hsp90, and the Sba1/p23 and FKBP52 cochaperones. Once in the mature complex, the GR achieves the ability to bind hormone with high affinity. Cryo-EM structures of Hsp90 and cochaperones in complex with GR demonstrate that each cochaperone makes direct contact with the GR, providing the basis for cochaperone-client selectivity [11–13]. However, evidence suggests GR and/or other clients may use a variety of mechanisms that include different cochaperones capable of targeting clients to Hsp90 [14–18]. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that clients interact with different subsets of cochaperones, and some cochaperones form functional networks [19, 20]. There are about twelve Hsp90 cochaperones in yeast and fifty in humans [6, 21]. One of our goals is to identify differences in how clients interact with Hsp90 and cochaperones in order to provide insight into potential mechanisms of selective inhibition of Hsp90 function. The two isoforms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 ( encoded by HSC82 and HSP82 ) are 97% identical. Yeast eEF2 ( encoded by EFT1 and EFT2 ) consists of two isoforms that are 100% identical [22, 23]. Both proteins are very abundant, with estimates of ~229, 000 polypeptides of Hsc82/Hsp82 per cell and 145, 000 polypeptides of Eft1/Eft2 [24]. eEF2 has a critical role in ribosome translocation, and mutations in eEF2 result in reduced translational fidelity, including an increase in frameshift mutations [25–27]. Mutations in human eEF2 result in nervous system abnormalities or developmental defects, including non-specific craniofacial dysmorphisms, abnormal brain morphology, and an autosomal dominant form of spinocerebellar ataxia [28, 29]. eEF2 undergoes a unique posttranslational diphthamide modification that is conserved in all eukaryotes and archaebacteria. Diphthamide is a modification of a histidine residue in eEF2 ( H699 in yeast ), and it is the target of diphtheria toxin ( DT ) and other bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins [30]. Diphthamide helps stabilize the anticodon-codon interaction, and it is required for maintenance of the accurate reading frame [26, 31, 32]. The folding of eEF2 was recently shown to be dependent on two cytosolic chaperones, the TRiC/CCT system and the Hsp90 machine. A novel cochaperone, Hgh1, was shown to directly interact with eEF2 and link it to Hsp90 via the Cns1 cochaperone. In the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor, or in cells expressing reduced levels of the Hgh1, Cpr7, or Cns1 cochaperones, eEF2 becomes misfolded and/or aggregated [33, 34]. We developed a series of yeast Hsp90 mutants, each with a single amino acid alteration in the Hsc82 isoform, that we grouped based on shared in vivo phenotypes and their ability to disrupt intermediate steps within the folding pathway. The mutants have varied effects on activity of select clients and sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors [35–37]. Many of the most studied Hsp90 mutants that have demonstrated defects in on activity of protein kinases and steroid hormone receptors fall into our ’loading and closing’ category. In contrast, we have not previously identified client defects that are strongest in cells expressing mutants in the ’reopening’ group. Here, we examined the effect of Hsp90 or cochaperone mutation on two distinct aspects of the function of eEF2, a recently identified Hsp90 client. We monitored eEF2 folding, as measured by steady-state levels of soluble eEF2, and susceptibility to diphtheria toxin. Our results suggest that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two genetically distinct roles in mediating eEF2 function. The folding of eEF2 is highly dependent on the Hgh1, Cpr7 and Cns1 cochaperones and most sensitive to the Hsp90 mutants in the reopening group. In contrast, sensitivity to diphtheria toxin is dependent on the Sti1 cochaperone and most sensitive to mutations in the loading and closing groups. These results demonstrate that the role of the Hsp90 machinery may vary as a single client progresses to the functional state. 
 Standard yeast genetic methods were employed. Yeast were transformed by lithium acetate methods and were grown in either YPD ( 1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose ) or defined synthetic complete media supplemented with 2% dextrose. Plasmid shuffling was used to swap in plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant His-eEF2, Hsc82 or Cns1. Transformants were cured of URA3 plasmids using 5-fluoroorotic acid ( 5-FOA ) obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals. Galactose was obtained from Fisher. Raffinose was obtained from Acros Organics ( Cat. 19567–1000 ). Antibodies used: polyclonal rabbit anti-eEF2 ( Kerafast, ED7002 ), monoclonal mouse anti-PGK1 ( Invitrogen, 459250 ), goat anti-rabbit HRP ( Invitrogen, 32460 ), goat anti-mouse HRP ( Invitrogen, 62–6520 ), rabbit polyclonal anti-Tim44 [35]. Plasmids expressing wild-type EFT1 on a URA3 plasmid and LEU2 plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant His-EFT2 ( YCpEFT2_6xHis-LEU2 ) were obtained from the laboratory of J.

Plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant Hsc82, Cns1, or Cpr7 have been described previously [35, 39, 40]. In vivo diphthamide biosynthesis was monitored by scoring viability of yeast cells upon conditional expression of a galactose-inducible diphtheria toxin ( GAL-DT ) plasmid pLMY101 [41]. The plasmid pRS424-HGH1 was constructed by inserting the coding sequence for Hgh1, along with approximately 1 kb upstream and 300 bp downstream flanking nucleotides into pRS424 [42]. The coding sequence of HGH1 in the plasmid was sequenced completely. Yeast strains are isogenic to W303 and are listed in S1 Table. Yeast strains containing individual deletions of EFT1, EFT2, HGH1 or DPH2 ( eft1::kanR, eft2::kanR, hgh1::kanR or dph2::kanrR ) were obtained from the knockout library collection ( Horizon Discovery ).

    Title: 
    Article: When making risky choices in social contexts, humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake. It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment. Thus, we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions implicated in risky decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others’ choices. Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. For socially situated decisions, these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. These findings suggest that in social contexts, following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. 
 In social contexts, decision-makers sometimes follow a crowd despite their own preferences toward a different course of action [1, 2]. This phenomenon has been documented in various forms in humans [3] and in nonhuman primates [4]. Recent studies indicate that when making socially situated choices, humans combine individual preferences for the options at stake with individual valuation of social information; contributions from each of these determine when choices made in a social context diverge ( or not ) from that which one’s preferences outside a social context would predict [5–11]. These previous studies have largely focused on understanding how social information contributes to choices with respect to individuals’ preferences about risk. Here, we investigated how risky decisions in social contexts are made when utility-based risk preferences are disrupted or inaccessible, as might be the case for individuals with certain psychopathologies or who are confronting novel options ( e. g., Gershman & Niv [12] ). Specifically, previous literature on decision-making in humans and non-human primates indicates that when individuals have a limited amount of private information, they tend to use various cognitive shortcuts or heuristics ( e. g., mimicking other agents ) to simplify decision processes [13–16]. In the current study, we use a risky decision-making task and examine whether such heuristics facilitate socially situated decision-making about risk when utility processing is disrupted. Previous work has shown that individual preferences and information from others are combined during risky decision-making under social influence [7, 8, 11, 17]. Neurally, the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices ( dACC ) have been shown to encode an interaction between one’s own risk preference and information from others. As such, these regions show greater hemodynamic responses when an individual’s preference differs from the observed choices of others [8]. The insula and dACC have also been consistently implicated in decision-making about risky options in non-social contexts, via lesion ( insula only ), functional neuroimaging ( insula and dACC ), and electrophysiology ( insula ) studies [18–23]. Thus, in situations where the structural or functional integrity of these regions is disrupted ( e. g., in some neurological or psychiatric disorders ) or where insufficient information or differing abilities impose constraints, individual computations and decisions about risky options may be disrupted, leaving open the question of how socially informed decision-making occurs in those cases. To examine this question, we administered a gambling task in both social and non-social contexts to individuals with focal insula or dACC lesions and tested models that measured the degree to which utility-based or heuristic-based processes were implemented during decision-making. Individuals with focal insula ( N = 10 ) or dACC lesions ( N = 6 ) and non-lesioned control participants ( NCs; N = 28 ) made a series of choices between pairs of gambles alone ( ‘Solo’ trials ) and after observing two others’ choices ( ‘Info’ trials; Fig 1A–1C; task developed in our previous work [7, 8] ). Trials comprised four distinct types: Solo, where participants did not see others’ choices; Info: ‘safe’, in which both of the two social others’ choices that the participant observed were the safer ( i. e., lower payoff variance ) gamble; Info: ‘risky’, in which the two social others’ choices were the riskier ( i. e., higher payoff variance ) gamble; and Info: ‘mix’, where one social other’s choice was the safer gamble, and one other’s choice was the riskier gamble. Info and Solo trials were intermixed throughout the task. 
 To first evaluate non-social decision-making under risk in our participants, we examined how well a standard utility model ( i. e., power utility function [24] ) and softmax choice rule [25]; see Materials and Methods for model specifications ) explained behavioral choices in Solo trials. Per economic utility theory [24], individuals’ preferences about risk can be captured by the concavity ( ρ ) of power utility functions ( U ( x ) = xρ ) that reflect individuals’ utility computations about risky options. We thus used a goodness-of-fit metric of the power utility model for explaining individual participants’ decisions about risky options as an indication of the extent to which utility-based decision-making was used. Specifically, we used the median negative log likelihood as it reflects the fit at the median parameter estimates which we use throughout the paper ( see Methods: Behavioral model specifications and model comparison ). As expected, participants with insula or dACC lesions showed worse model fit compared with NCs [i. e., comparisons of negative log likelihood ( −LL ) in Solo trials, P = 0. 0072; see also [18–21] reporting insula or dACC involvement in utility-based decision-making under risk. This remained true after controlling for individuals’ risk preference ( P = 0. 0019 ). Post-hoc analyses by lesion area indicated that compared with NCs, participants with insula lesions showed worse model fit while participants with dACC lesions trended toward worse model fit ( P = 0. 032 and P = 0. 073, respectively; Fig 1d; see Materials and Methods for full details and S1 Fig for model-agnostic choice behaviors ). Participants with insula lesions and participants with dACC lesions did not differ in model fit ( P = 0. 87, Bayes factor ( BFnull ) = 2. 27 ). Using these participants with insula or dACC lesions as exemplars, we next sought to examine whether heuristics may facilitate socially situated decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. Previously, we developed an ‘other-conferred utility ( OCU ) ’ model and showed that the impact of social information on decisions about risky options is captured by increased utility to the option chosen by others and thus, increased likelihood of choosing this option [8]; we refer to this type of social information use as ‘OCU-based’ or ‘utility-based. ’ This model, along with its modified version, has been validated in independent simulations showing both model and parameter recovery [7, 26]. Here, to accommodate the possibility of incorporating social information into decisions independent of utility computations ( i. e., ‘heuristic-based’ or ‘OCU-free’ use of social information ), we extend our previous OCU model [8] and introduce weight parameters that allow a mixture between OCU-based and OCU-free contributions of social information to participants’ decisions ( ‘hybrid model’ hereafter ). The OCU-free parameters allow the initial testing of zeroth order social heuristics that have been previously shown to affect decision-making [13]; in the present work, these choices are either in alignment with or in opposition to the choices made by others [8, 9]. We subsequently call these choices that ‘follow’ or ‘oppose, ’ respectively, those of social others. In this mixture model, weight parameters ωutility, ωfollow, and ωoppose capture the degree to which social information is incorporated into decision-making, dependent upon ( ωutility ) or independent from ( ωfollow and ωoppose ) social utility-based processes ( Figs 2, S2, S3, and S4 for further model description and validation information ). Note that if an individual uses social information in a way that fully relies on other-conferred utility ( i. e., ωutility = 1 ), the mixture model prediction is equivalent to that of the original OCU model [8]; if an individual uses social information in a manner that is fully free from other-conferred utility ( OCU-free; i. e., ωfollow + ωoppose = 1 ), their choices would be consistent with the simple heuristics of fully following or opposing those of social others, regardless of the gamble options. See S5 Fig for model comparison of the hybrid model against an only OCU-free heuristic model, an only OCU-based model, and a Solo risk preference model, showing best fit of the hybrid model for explaining participants’ choices. Compared with non-lesion controls, participants with insula or dACC lesions as a combined group showed significantly larger following weights ( ωfollow; Fig 3A; P = 0. 014 ). This group difference result remained consistent after controlling for individuals’ risk preference ( P = 0. 0074 ). Post-hoc analyses by lesion area indicated that relative to the non-lesion controls, participants with insula lesions ( P = 0. 036 ) and with dACC lesions ( P = 0. 025 ) also both showed significantly larger ωfollow. These results indicate that individuals with focal lesions in insula or dACC relied more heavily on heuristics following the choices of others when utility-based risk processing was disrupted. Participants with insula and d lesions did not differ in ωfollow ( P 0. , Bayes BF = 0 2. 5 ). In contrast, participants with dACC lesions showed larger ωop ( P 0., Bayes BF 0. 5 ) indicating that they relied more on heur opposing the choices of others when utility-based processing was disrupted. These findings suggest that when utility-based risk processing is disrupted, individuals with insula rely on heur following the choices of others, while those with dACC rely on heur opposing the choices of others. In conclusion, our results show that when utility-based risk processing is disrupted, individuals with insula rely on heur following the choices of others, while those with dACC rely on heur opposing the choices of others. These findings suggest that in social contexts, following the choices of others may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. Our results are consistent with previous studies indicating that when individuals have limited information, they tend to use heuristics to simplify decision processes [13–16]. The insula and dACC have been implicated in risky decision-making in both social and non-social contexts [18–23], and our results suggest that when these regions are disrupted, individuals may rely on heur to make socially situated decisions about risk. The insula and d have been shown to encode interaction between one’s preference and information from others [8], and our results indicate that when utility-based processing is disrupted, individuals with insula rely on heur following the choices of others. In contrast, the dACC has been implicated in risky decision-making in non-social contexts [18–23] and our results suggest that when utility-based processing is disrupted, those withACC rely on heur opposing the choices of others. These findings have implications for understanding decision-making in individuals with neurological or psychiatric disorders where utility-based risk processing is disrupted.

    Title: 
    Article: Biomorphs, Richard Dawkins’s iconic model of morphological evolution, are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations. Here we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be many orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations. Moreover, this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. Such bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. By using population genetics simulations, we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, as well as many other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. Many of these patterns can be explained with an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. We postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns biomorphs share with molecular genotype-phenotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems. 
 In his influential book, The Blind Watchmaker [1], Richard Dawkins’s illustrates how natural selection can efficiently find fitness maxima in ‘hyper-astronomically large’ [2] search spaces by introducing an intriguing twist on the famous infinite monkey theorem. He frames his argument by first introducing the classic case ( see Fig 1 ) with a question: How likely is it that a monkey randomly typing on a typewriter produces Hamlet’s 28-character phrase “METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL”? For a monkey typing on an M-key typewriter, the probability to produce a specific string of n characters will scale as 1/Mn, which rapidly becomes unimaginably small with increasing n. By analogy, random mutations on their own are unlikely to produce meaningful biological novelty. Dawkins’s contrasts this picture with his second version of the infinite monkey theorem, where a fitness function acts on each letter independently. The output stops changing once the correct letter is found, so that on average only M random keystrokes are needed for each letter. Thus, any n letter phrase can be produced in a number of keystrokes that scales as n × M, which is exponentially smaller than in the first case. This simple but evocative example illustrates an important property of biological sequence spaces. For a given alphabet size M, their size grows exponentially with sequence length L as ML, but genomic distances remain linear in L because on the order of L mutations can be used to link any two sequences. By using fitness functions of the kind that Dawkins’s introduced, an evolutionary search algorithm can exploit this linearity and locate a fitness maximum in an exponentially large high-dimensional search space within a relatively small number of randomly generated steps. In this paper, we explore the evolutionary consequences of a third ( algorithmic ) version of this famous trope of monkeys on keyboards ( see Fig 1 ). In Dawkins’s version, the monkeys directly type out components of the outputs, i. e. the phenotypes. In evolution, however, novel phenotypic variation is generated indirectly by random mutations which are then “decoded” through the process of development. To capture this mapping from genotypes ( the inputs ) to phenotypes ( the outputs ), consider instead monkeys generating outputs by typing at random into a computer programming language [3]. In contrast to the classical version of the infinite monkey theorem, where all output strings of length n are equally likely ( with probability p = 1/Mn ), in the algorithmic picture, certain outputs appear exponentially more frequently than others. Consider the following example ( from ref [3] ) : a string of length n = 1000 of the form “010101…” would appear when typing the 21-character program “print ‘01’ 500 times;”. Therefore, its probability p = 1/M21 is many orders of magnitude larger than the probability p = 1/M1000 for the classical version. Thus, within this algorithmic picture, there are certain kinds of outputs, namely those for which short programs exist, which have an exponentially higher probability than outputs without such short algorithmic descriptions [3]. Interestingly, an algorithmic picture of evolution is also introduced in a famous passage from chapter 5 of the Blind Watchmaker [1], where Dawkins’s describes seeds falling from a tree: “It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were raining floppy discs. ”. Can the intuitive link between our simple algorithmic picture and the mapping from genotypes to phenotypes be made more rigorous? To this end, we turn to the field of algorithmic information theory ( AIT ) [4] where a central concept is the algorithmic probability P ( x ) that a universal Turing machine, a computing device that can perform any possible computation, generates a particular output x upon random sampling of input programs. This probability decays exponentially with the Kolmogorov complexity K ( x ) of the output string x, where K ( x ) is the length of the shortest program with which x can be produced on the universal Turing machine. Because K ( x ) is the length of the shortest program that generates output x, these concepts from AIT formalise the algorithmic picture of monkeys typing into a computer programming language: The shortest program has the highest probability. One difficulty with these formal arguments is that many input-output maps where one might want to apply the intuition of the monkeys on keyboards are not the universal Turing machines upon which AIT relies. However, an upper bound has recently been derived for the probability P ( x ) that an output x is obtained upon random sampling of inputs for a broad class of computable input-output maps [5]. It takes the specific form: P ( x ) ≤ 2 - a K ˜ ( x ) + b, ( 1 ) where the descriptional complexity K ˜ ( x ) is a suitable approximation to the ( uncomputable ) Kolmogorov complexity, and two constants a and b are independent of the outputs x. Typically K ˜ ( x ) is based on some measure of compression [5]. This relationship between probability and the complexity of the output has been called “simplicity bias” in the context of computable input-output maps [5]: outputs with high P ( x ) will have small K ˜ ( x ), and outputs with large K ˜ ( x ) will have low P ( x ) ( but not necessarily vice-versa because Eq 1 is an upper bound ). In [3, 5, 6] it was shown that this bound holds for a wide range of input-output maps. It has recently been argued [3] that many genotype-to-phenotype ( GP ) maps obey the mathematical conditions needed for Eq 1 to be satisfied, formalizing the intuitive connection between GP maps and the algorithmic infinite monkey theorem. GP maps typically exhibit redundancy due to neutral mutations [7], where ‘neutral’ simply means that the mutation does not change the phenotype, which is a simpler definition than the classical notion introduced by Kimura [8]. This redundancy naturally leads to the concept of a neutral set made up of all the genotypes that map to a given phenotype p. We can define the associated probability P ( p ) that a randomly selected genotype belongs to the neutral set of p, which is also referred to as the phenotype frequency fp of p. It is directly proportional to the size of the neutral set. Phenotype bias occurs when there are large differences in the neutral set sizes ( or equivalently in the fp ) associated with different phenotypes p [9]. Strong evidence for this “simplicity bias” was found at the molecular scale for the GP maps of RNA secondary structure, the polyomino model for protein quaternary structure, and a popular model of the yeast cell-cycle gene regulatory network [3]. For example, phenotype bias towards simplicity can explain key patterns in nature such as an observed strong preference for symmetry in protein complexes, and the fact that the most frequent RNA secondary structures found in nature have structures that are highly compressible, and therefore are simple with low descriptional complexity K ˜ ( p ) [3]. In RNA especially, detailed quantitative comparisons are possible: For example, if the secondary structures are coarse-grained using level-5 of the RNAshapes method [10], then the 68 evolved secondary structures of length L = 126 found in the RNAcentral database [11] of functional RNA are among the 96 structures with highest phenotypic frequencies out of a much larger set of 1012 topologically possible level 5 structures [9]. This observation does not negate the role of selection. Each functional RNA structure in the database will have fixed due to natural selection, and a randomly selected sequence would be unlikely to perform a given biological function ( see [12] for a recent discussion ). But it does mean that nature was able to produce the “endless forms most beautiful” [13] of the living world from only a minuscule fraction of the set of all RNA structures, namely those that are most likely to appear by random mutations. In this paper, we show that the “simplicity” bias is not limited to the molecular scale, but holds for developmental systems as well. We demonstrate this using simulations of the evolution of phenotypic variation in the biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution introduced by Richard Dawkins [14]. In the model, phenotypic variation is generated by random mutations which are then “decoded” through the process of development. We find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations. Moreover, this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. This bias towards simplicity is formalized by the information-theoretic principle that can intuitively understood a picture evolution searching in the space of algorithms. Using population simulations, we demonstrate how moderately phenotypic variation that appears frequently upon random can fix at the expense of highly biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, as well as other patterns in the structure of variation for biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between phenotypic evolvability and robustness, closely resemble findings in molecular-phenotype maps. Many of these patterns can be explained by an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained of the genome. We postulate that the bias towards simplicity and other biomorphs with molecular-phen maps may hold widely for developmental systems.

    Title: 
    Article: Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically. This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. However, it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. These nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) are computable with a recently developed numerical mode tool. Using this tool, the present resarch compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems. In a user study consisting of three experiment parts, participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ). In all tested experiment variations, participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. Consequently, our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems. Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. 
 Humans exhibit remarkable dexterity and versatility while using their upper limbs for daily activities. We can easily handle countless different objects, even when they are complex in shape, flexible in material, have multiple degrees of freedom ( DOFs ), or exhibit highly nonlinear or even chaotic dynamic behavior. In fact, studies show that humans can partially follow [1] and learn to predict [2, 3] chaotic system behavior. It is likely that the Central Nervous System ( CNS ) also employs chaotic control to explore system dynamics and tune into intrinsic motion patterns to excite resonant behavior [4]. This enables orchestrating numerous DOFs together, reducing the needed control effort. Everyday examples showcase human intuitive resonance sensitivity: without conscious effort, humans induce oscillatory motions when jumping on a trampoline or bouncing a ball by tuning to the intrinsic system dynamics [5, 6]. This excites the resonant frequency, which appears to be more predictable for humans [7, 8]. Predictability facilitates forming an internal model of objects and their dynamic behavior in interactions [9–12]. By learning and internalizing physical object models, humans can anticipate system motions, enabling anticipatory control strategies that leverage this knowledge [13–15]. Experiments have suggested that predictability becomes a priority for human control in rhythmic movement tasks. They are willing to sacrifice metabolic efficiency by adopting control trajectories that yield higher reaction forces and are less smooth [16, 17]. Instead of applying precise force control, humans tune their hand impedance to the system to take advantage of interactive dynamics [18, 19]. A cup balancing experiment showed that participants always chose similar starting positions to initialize the task [20], proving that humans can get an intuitive feeling even of complex nonlinear system dynamics. Despite daily encounters with nonlinear dynamics, empirical evidence of human reso- nance sensitivity is mostly limited to interactions with simple systems exhibiting linear dynamics [21, 22]. Testing if humans intuitively excite and stabilize intrinsic nonlinear behaviors requires nonlinear dynamics to be computable in advance for comparison. But unlike the eigenmodes of linear systems [23, 24], intrinsic motions in nonlinear systems cannot be derived analytically. Instead, periodicity in chaotic systems can be found and stabilized through phase synchronization [2, 25], but multiple possible periodic orbits make it hard to predict which solutions emerge in human interactions. However, recent research showed even nonlinear systems like the double pendulum, a classic example of chaotic behavior [26], display predictable, computable periodic orbits [27, 28]. These orbits can be determined with numerical methods based on algebraic topology and differential geometry. One class of these periodic orbits are nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ), similar in appearance and description to the linear analogy of eigenmodes. Analogously, they oscillate with a characteristic eigenfrequency between two turning points, where all velocities are zero. However, unlike linear eigenmodes, the shape of the nonlinear mode and the associated eigenfrequency changes with increasing energy levels and does not always cross the system’s equilibrium. Yet, NNMs allow us to predict intrinsically preferred motions for conservative nonlinear systems on defined energy levels computable with a mode tool developed by our group [29, 30]. This tool enabled us to investigate whether humans are indeed sensitive to resonance in nonlinear systems and intuitively excite and stabilize a system close to its NNM. We directly test this hypothesis with a human user study, where participants had to excite periodic motions in a virtual compliant double pendulum. Through a haptic joystick, participants moved a virtual motor link coupled to the first link l1 of the double pendulum by a spring k1 ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Rotating the motor link induced motions in the pendulum system and the spring forces were reflected to the user as haptic force feedback. By varying the equilibrium of the spring k2 connecting the first and second pendulum link, different pendulum configurations ( P0, P90, P45 ) could be tested ( Fig 1C ). In each case, the task was to alternately hit two target balls to collect hit points. There were two major reasons for choosing a compliant double pendulum for the investigation. First, although the system is not inherently chaotic if the compliance is chosen high enough, the dynamics of the double pendulum is strongly nonlinear. It is the simplest model approximation of a flexible object, such as a whip or rope. As such, it can be easily extended with further links in future work to analyze interactions with more complex dynamics. Second, human resonance sensitivity is presumably not only important in object interactions but also for the control of one’s own body. Hence, the compliant double pendulum can also be regarded as the simplest approximation of a human limb. Insights about how humans excite and stabilize such dynamics might support further investigations on human motor learning and control. To identify the pattern underlying the human control approach, prior to the user experiment, three baseline strategies ( BL1–3 ) were defined based on literature-reported human control principles. In simulations, each strategy commanded a position signal to the pendulum’s motor link ( Fig 1, red link ), which was identical to what participants controlled by moving the haptic joystick. The amplitude of all strategies was empirically tuned to reach the two targets with the second pendulum link tip. The first strategy BL1 was in line with our hypothesis that human resonance sensitivity extends to non- linear systems. Thus, BL1 commanded a sine wave with the predicted eigenfrequencies of the different pendulum configurations to the motor link. Alternatively, the strategies BL2 and BL3 characterize strategies that do not excite resonance but resemble other known human control principles. BL2 was inspired by findings that humans make use of motion constraints to reduce their effort [31], prioritizing the smoothness of hand and actuating forces [32]. Thus, we expected a strategy that would avoid extensive spring deflections and rapid direction changes to ensure low forces and smooth curves. Hence, BL2 commanded a sine wave at a frequency much lower than the predicted NNM frequencies such that motor link speed synchronizes with both pendulum links and avoids spring deflections. Finally, BL3 was a bang-bang controller. This strategy can model arm reaching motions following a minimum acceleration with constraints principle [33] and match the muscle activations in this motion [34]. Previous studies also suggested this approach to excite eigendynamics [35], later adapted for robot applications [36]. This robotic controller was used to model BL3 in the experiments. To quantify the participant performance and compare it with BL1–3, four metrics were defined. First, the achieved target hit scores were determined as a measure of successful task execution and precision. Second, the oscillation frequency fosc of the excited pendulum was assessed as an apparent indicator of resonant behavior. Third, we introduce the mode metric η to quantify how close the excited pendulum motions through the participants and BL1–3 were to the respective NNM. It was expected that the pendulum motions in the experiment would not congruently match the ideal NNM path, since the NNM computation can only be performed for energy-conservative systems [27]. However, in the experimental settings, joint friction had to be added to the pendulum models to require a control input to be evaluated. According to our hypothesis, humans would intuitively stabilize the damped system on a trajectory close to the NNM if the intrinsic dynamics was exploited. Thus, the lower the mode metric value η, the closer the excited pendulum motion to the predicted NNM trajectory. The metric was derived from the time-independent method of Dynamic Time Warping ( DTW ) [37, 38] to allow joint trajectory comparisons for varying oscillation frequencies. Finally, we juxtapose the joystick motion translating to the motor link trajectory θ to the pendulum link paths q1. Specifically, the deflection ratio ρ = max ( θ ) /max ( q1 ) and phase lag ϕ between these two signals were calculated. The deflection ρ indicates how much the joystick motion was translated to the pendulum motion, while the phase ϕ indicates the delay between the two signals. The deflection ρ and phase ϕ were used to assess how well the participant controlled the pendulum’s dynamics. The experiment consisted of three parts, each with different configurations of the double pendulum ( P, P, P, P ). In each part, the task was to hit two targets with the tip of the pendulum. In Experiments 1 and 2, the targets were aligned with the N of the respective pendulum configurations. In Experiment 3, the targets were purposefully offset from the N. In all experiments, participants used the haptic joystick to control the pendulum’s first link. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were instructed to hit the targets as fast as possible. In Experiment 3, the task was to hit the targets as accurately as possible. In all experiments, participants were instructed to use their preferred strategy to hit the targets. The results show that in all experiments, participants intuitively applied a strategy that excites the resonance and stabilizes an orbit close to the N of the system.

    Title: 
    Article: Regulation of transcription is a fundamental process that allows bacteria to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response. In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation is at the core of developmental processes needed for cell survival. Gene expression in cells transitioning from exponential phase to stationary phase is under the control of a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ). TSRs influence numerous developmental processes including the decision between biofilm formation and motility, genetic competence, and sporulation, but the extent to which TSRs influence bacterial physiology remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis of the relationship between the three transcription factors indicate that all are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. Similarly, expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Lastly, our in vitro data indicate a weak direct role for ScoC in controlling pulcherrimin production along with AbrB and PchR. The layered regulation by two distinct regulatory systems underscores the important role for pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology. 
 In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, complex arrays of gene networks function together to precisely time the expression of gene products. A prime example is the series of decisions made as cells transition from exponential growth to stationary phase upon nutrient limitation [1]. This phase, termed the transition state, is where cells in the population use environmental cues to inform the next course of action to survive in the new environment, specifically whether to engage in competence, biofilm formation, motility, secondary metabolism, and/or acquisition of nutrients [1]. While there are many transcription factors controlling these processes, an important set among these are called transition state regulators ( TSRs ). Originally defined in the context of sporulation, TSRs are regulators that inhibit expression of genes involved in developmental processes but do not result in a sporulation null mutation when deleted [2, 3]. Notably, mutants in TSRs are still able to carry out post-exponential phenotypes, however the magnitude and timing of these phenotypes are disrupted [4]. ScoC and AbrB represent two well-studied TSRs in B. subtilis. ScoC is a MarR-family winged helix-turn-helix transcription factor first identified in hyper-protease mutants [5, 6]. Microarray analysis between WT and scoC mutants identified 560 genes with differential gene expression involved in motility and genetic competence as well as protease production and peptide transport [7]. The smaller AbrB ( 10. 8 kDa ) is part of a large family of transcription factors with a beta-alpha-beta DNA binding N-terminal domain [8]. Mutants of abrB have pleiotropic effects and some regulatory overlap with ScoC [9, 10]. ChIP-seq analyses of AbrB identified many binding sites with a bipartite TGGNA motif [9, 11]. Pulcherrimin is a secreted iron chelating molecule that has been a topic of research in B. subtilis and other microorganisms [12–16]. Pulcherrimin is synthesized by first cyclization of two tRNA-charged leucines to form cyclo-L ( leucine-leucine ) ( cLL ), and second, oxidation to form water-soluble pulcherriminic acid ( Fig 1A ). Pulcherriminic acid is then transported outside of the cell where it can bind to free ferric iron to form the water-insoluble pulcherrimin ( Fig 1A ). While many microorganisms harbor the genes to produce pulcherrimin, the purpose of such a system to sequester iron is still unclear. Arnaouteli and coworkers found that pulcherrimin production contributed to growth arrest during B. subtilis biofilm formation through its ability to precipitate available extracellular iron [12]. Additionally, the ability of pulcherriminic acid to strongly sequester iron contributes to its anti-oxidative effects by limiting Fenton chemistry, providing evidence as an important antioxidant in cells [17, 18]. Pulcherrimin biosynthesis is negatively regulated by the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, which is found in a cluster of two divergently transcribed gene-pairs encoding pulcherrimin biosynthesis ( yvmC and cypX ), regulation and transporter ( pchR and yvmA ) ( Fig 1B ) [12, 13]. Interestingly, AbrB binding sites have been identified in the promoter for pulcherrimin biosynthesis and regulatory genes, suggesting AbrB was involved in pulcherrimin biosynthesis, however genetic analysis of AbrB regulation of pulcherrimin was not demonstrated [9, 11]. Further, whether other TSRs are involved in the regulation of pulcherrimin production is not known. In this study, we provide evidence for a multi-layered regulation of pulcherrimin biosynthesis by the TSRs ScoC and AbrB as well as the pulcherrimin regulator PchR. We explore the kinetics of pulcherrimin production throughout the transition state and found that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR control the timing, rate, and amount of pulcherrimin produced by modulating expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthetic gene cluster yvmC-cypX. We further establish the roles of PchR and AbrB in direct regulation of gene expression utilizing in vitro DNA binding assays and provide evidence that ScoC can bind directly to the yvmC promoter in vitro. Together our results establish a model where pulcherrimin biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase in addition to input from PchR, linking stationary phase with extracellular iron sequestration. 
 A derivative of the wild-type strain 3610 B. subtilis harboring an amino acid substitution in the competence inhibitor ComI ( Q12I ) was used as the background strain in these studies [19]. Gene replacements and deletions were constructed as described [20]. Gel purified gene-targeting antibiotic resistance cassettes and non-replicative plasmids ( see Cloning for construction details ) were used to transform B. subtilis by natural transformation. Briefly, single colonies of the strain of interest were used to inoculate 1 mL LB supplemented with 3 mM MgSO4 and grown to mid-exponential phase while shaking at 230 RPM at 37°C. The cultures were then back diluted 1:50 into 2 mL MD media ( 1X PC buffer [10X PC—10. 7 g K2HPO4, 6 g KH2PO4, 1. 18 g trisodium citrate dehydrate, deionized water to 100 ml, filter sterilize], 2% glucose, 0. 05 mg/mL tryptophan, 0. 05 mg/mL phenylalanine, 0. 01 mg/mL ferric ammonium citrate, 2. 5 mg/ml potassium aspartate, 3 mM MgSO4, water up to 2 mL ) and grown for 3–5 hours, until early stationary phase. 10 μL of purified gene-targeting antibiotic resistance cassettes ( ~200–400 ng total ) were added to 0. 2 mL competent B. subtilis, were further incubated one hour, and plated on LB agar plates supplemented with either erythromycin ( 50 μg/mL ), kanamycin ( 10 μg/mL ), chloramphenicol ( 5 μg/mL ), and/or spectinomycin ( 100 μg/mL ). Antibiotic resistance clones were restruck on selection and insertions were verified by colony PCR using the US forward and DS reverse primers ( See S1 Table ). To remove the antibiotic resistance cassette, plasmid pDR224 was used to transform the appropriate strain with transformants selected for on LB supplemented with spectinomycin ( 100 μg/mL ). Spectinomycin resistant clones were struck out on LB and incubated at the non-permissive temperature of 42°C; this process was repeated twice. Clones were then rescreened for sensitivity of spectinomycin and the absence of the integrated antibiotic resistance cassette using PCR. To generate gene disruptions, oligos were designed to amplify upstream ( US ) and downstream ( DS ) of the gene of interest with appropriate overhangs to fuse either an erythromycin or kanamycin resistance cassette ( AbR ) flanked by CRE recombinase recognition sites [20]. Oligonucleotides were designed using NEBuilder ( NEB ) with the default parameters except minimum overlap length was changed from 20 nucleotides to 30 nucleotides. Q5 polymerase ( NEB ) was used to amplify the appropriate PCR amplicon. All amplicons were gel extracted prior to assembly reactions ( Qiagen ). US, DS, and AbR fragments were assembled by splice by overlap extension ( SOE ) PCR [21] using 1 μM of each oligonucleotide and 0. 5 μM dNTPs with 0.25 U/μL Taq polymerase (NEB) in 1X PCR buffer at 95°C for 2 min, 95°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min for 30 cycles, 72°C for 5 min 72 for 30 cycles 72 for 5 min. Amplicons were gel purified ( Qiagen ) and used to transform competent B. subis as described above. Gene deletions were verified by PCR using the US and DS primers ( S1 Table ). To generate overexpression plasmids, oligonucleotides were designed to amplify the gene of interest with appropriate overhangs to fuse to the promoter Pspac promoter [22]. Oligonucleides were designed using NEBuilder (NE ) with default parameters except minimum length was changed to 20 to 30 nucleotides.5 polymerase (NE ) was used to amplify the appropriate amplicon. Amplic were extracted prior to assembly ( Qiagen ) and assembled by SOE PCR [21] using 1 μM each oligonucleotide 0.5 μM dNTPs with 0.25/μL Taq polymer (NE) in 1X buffer 95°C 2, 95 30, 72 1 30, 72 5 30 72 5. Amplic were purified ( Qi ) and used to transform B. subis as described. Overexpressions were verified by PCR using the forward and reverse primers ( S Table 1 ) To generate the pulerr biosynthetic cluster, oligonucleides were designed to amplify yC and cX with appropriate overhangs to fuse to the Psp promoter [22]. oligonucleides were designed using NE (NE ) with default parameters except minimum length changed to 20 to 30 nucleotides. polymer (NE ) was used to amplify the appropriate amplic.

    Title: 
    Article: After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI. We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI. The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage. Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI. 
 Many patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) above the lumbar spine lose voluntary control of bladder function, either partially or entirely, and develop a neurogenic bladder, which manifests as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) —a lack of coordination between the detrusor and sphincter muscles that prevents effective bladder emptying. On the other hand, patients with SCI at the lumbosacral spinal level have an areflexic, flaccid bladder, reduced bladder capacity, and an inability to store urine leading to incontinence [1]. Electromagnetic stimulation of the spinal cord is a promising approach to restore lower urinary tract ( LUT ) functions after SCI. Epidural electrical stimulation and transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) of the lumbar spine below the level of injury influence neural activities within the spine and have the potential to foster recovery of bladder function after SCI [2–5]. The mechanisms whereby spinal cord stimulation affects the activities of the neural circuits in the lumbosacral spine governing LUT function and improve control of micturition remain uncertain. Urine storage and release are maintained by a combination of higher cortical mechanisms and semi-autonomous functions embedded in the brainstem and in spinal reflex pathways in normal individuals [6–11]. Mathematical modeling of micturition is a useful analytical process that compels investigators to define explicitly, in mathematical terms, the physiological processes controlling urine storage and release. Previous investigators modelled the biomechanical features of the bladder with limited external neurophysiological controls or focused on the neural elements controlling the bladder ( and largely ignored the biomechanism constraints of the bladder ) [8–11]. In either case, the models were based on mechanistic descriptions of physiological processes that incorporated the smallest set of neural or biochemical features needed to describe the behavior being modelled, and the models described control of the LUT in healthy subjects. Muscle dynamics have been described by Hill equations ( which describe the activation of muscles controlling the bladder in terms of muscle length, tension, and velocity of shortening ), but neural elements were represented by static models, such as the weighted sum of inputs operating around a threshold or a logical on/off switch [10]. More recently, a model including the supraspinal voiding reflex was used to examine the effect of pudendal nerve stimulation on bladder contraction [12]. The neural elements were modeled as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, and nerve stimulation was simulated as action potentials in the pudendal nerve. Last, a model based on what might be described as weighted logic gates to simulate excitatory or inhibitory neurons within the circuit of micturition control produced on/off reflex responses that simulated normal urine storage and micturition [13]. None of these previous models addressed the effect of SCI on micturition. Given the limited capacity to perform invasive measurements in humans, modeling the dynamical behavior of the neural circuits controlling micturition provides a useful mechanism to explore how SCI may alter control of micturition and how spinal cord stimulation may ameliorate control of bladder function. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model of the spinal micturition circuit as a dynamical network of neural nodes described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations so that spinal cord stimulation was incorporated directly as a transient opening of the sodium channels. The activity of the network controlling micturition was dictated by the nature of afferent inputs, the connectivity of the network nodes, and the synaptic and ionic characteristics of the model neurons [14]. The basic architecture of a simplified network model of micturition was simulated based on an established model of normal storage/voiding functions as controlled by the spinal storage reflex and supraspinal control of voiding [6]. Once the simplified model controlling micturition under normal, uninjured circumstances was constructed, we introduced the minimum number of additional, novel features needed to create a single, unified model with a fixed network architecture that reproduced observations both before and after SCI and with and without TMS applied to the lumbar spine. 
 Several previous models embody the hierarchical structure of control of urination in normal subjects [6, 13, 15–17], and though they differ slightly from each other, they share a core architecture describing the neural feedback controlling micturition [15, 18]. The features of this traditional model are shown schematically in Fig 1A [15, 18]. Spinal cord injury above the lumbar level blocks or weakens supraspinal control of voiding and prevents reciprocal coordination between the activity of the bladder and the urethra. Previous models of ‘normal’ bladder and urethral sphincter control have not replicated the usual patterns of bladder dysfunction observed after a spinal cord injury, such as an overactive bladder ( disinhibited detrusor contractions and urine leakage ) or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( simultaneous contraction of the detrusor and the urethral sphincter ). The dysfunctional patterns of bladder activity after a SCI derive from interactions among spinal networks of interneurons, neuronal plasticity, and reorganization of spinal circuitry that foster emergence of a latent spinal voiding reflex [1, 6, 30–33]. When a SCI occurs at T10 or above ( an upper-level injury; the red dashed line in Fig 1B ), communication between the brainstem circuits and the spinal micturition circuits is blocked or attenuated. The control of urine storage in the bladder remains intact, as autonomous feedback below the level of injury enables inhibition of bladder contraction and excitation of the urethral sphincter However, bladder emptying is dysfunction: the lack of descending signals from the PMC allows detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia to emerge, and, depending on the level of SCI, the bladder may not simply be overfilled; it can also be overactive, which may result in incontinence. We addressed the failure of the traditional model to replicate the LUT dysfunction seen after spinal cord injury at T10 or above in two steps: we introduced interneuronal elements and patterns of neuronal connectivity to generate a infantile spinal voiding reflex, which has been demonstrated in previous studies of neonatal animals [1, 32, 34]. Second, though the circuitry for the spinal voiding is present in adults, the reflex is inactive. Therefore, we introduced descending pontine inhibitory control over the spinal voiding reflex so that the reflex circuitry is present, but the reflex activity remains latent in intact, adult animals and humans. In addition, we added lumbar interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a mechanism whereby TMS may modify lumbar spinal reflexes regulating urinary behaviors. These changes are aligned with physiological studies and proposed mechanisms of responses to SCI and TMS [2, 32]. Last, we made some changes to make the model computationally tractable. The additions to the traditional model that we made to accommodate SCI and the response to TMS are summarized in Table 1. Each node in the network, shown in Fig 1B, was modeled as a single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron connected to other neurons in the network as indicated in the figure. The behavior of each node ( representing a population of neurons ) was described by Hodgkin-Huxley type equations: cv˙+ ( t ) = − g Na v ( v ( t ) − E Na ) + g K v ( v ( t − E K ) + g L v ( v ( t − E L ) + I ext ( t ) where v ( t ) is the membrane potential of the node at time t, g Na, K, and L are the conductances for sodium, potassium, and leak, respectively, E Na, K, and L are the reversal potentials for sodium, potassium, and leak, respectively, and I ext is the external current applied to the node. The Hodgkin-Hley equations are a set of four coupled nonlinear differential equations that describe the dynamics of the membrane potential of a neuron in response to ionic currents and synaptic inputs [35, 36]. The parameters of the Hodg-Hodgkin equations were chosen based on previous studies of spinal interneurons [ 37, 38 ]. The network of nodes in Fig 1B was simulated using the Hodg-Hodkin equations with a time step size of 0.1 ms and a time step size of 0.1 ms. The parameters of the Hodg-Hodkin equations were chosen based on previous studies of spinalneurons [ 37, 38 ]. The network of nodes in Fig 1 was simulated the Hodg-Hodkin equations with a time step of 0.1 and a step of 0.1. The parameters of the Hodg-Hodkin were based on studies of spinalne [ 37 38.

    Title: 
    Article: Quantifying fungal growth underpins our ability to effectively treat severe fungal infections. Current methods quantify fungal growth rates from time-course morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length data. However, automated large-scale collection of such data lies beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of fungal growth to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect, but indirect, optical density ( OD600 ) data of Aspergillus fumigatus growth ( filamentous fungus ). Our method accounts for OD600 being an indirect measure by explicitly including the relationship between the indirect OD600 measurements and the calibrating true fungal growth in the model. Therefore, the method does not require de novo generation of calibration data. Our model outperformed reference models at fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves and overcame observed discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD600 versus directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration. 
 Fungal infections affect over a billion people worldwide [1] and remain a global threat to human health [2]. Combatting fungal infections is essential for treating patients with life-threatening invasive infections [1]. In the clinic, the invasive fungal infection, invasive aspergillosis, is widely prevalent [1] and associated with unacceptably high mortality rates [2] of around 29% [3], even with treatment. Without appropriate treatment, invasive aspergillosis can result in 100% mortality, as seen with COVID-associated-pulmonary-aspergillosis [4]. Whilst most fungal infections are treated with antifungal drugs [5, 6], the issue of antifungal resistance [7], spanning to multi-drug resistance, may shrink an already small pool of treatment options for patients [8]. To avoid patients being left with no treatment options, there is a real need to locate new antifungal drugs and for increased antifungal stewardship [7]. Antifungal stewardship requires detecting and quantifying fungal growth in different conditions to evaluate potential resistance or drug efficacy. Multiple fungal pathogens have recently been identified as critical threats to public health by the world health organisation ( WHO ) [9]. These fungi can exhibit complex growth dynamics, such as filamentation, due to morphogenesis [10, 11], where morphogenesis is also promoted by exposure to antifungal drugs [12]. The current standards for antifungal susceptibility testing for filamentous fungi, set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) and the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing ( EUCAST ), involve evaluating minimum inhibitory/fungicidal/effective concentrations ( MIC/MFC/MEC ) in vitro [13–15], which is the minimum drug concentration required to reduce or alter the morphology of fungal biomass within a certain time [15–18]. However, further development of antifungal susceptibility testing for filamentous fungi is required for the following two reasons. First, the current CLSI and EUCAST standards include subjective measurements that depend upon visual inspection of changes in growth [19]. Second, the current guidelines cannot capture time-dependent antifungal activity or antifungal activity specific to a particular fungal morphology ( morphology-specific antifungal activity ). The MIC/MFC/MEC do not describe temporal dynamics of fungal growth because they are based upon a single end-point measurement. These metrics also cannot capture morphology-specific antifungal activity while fungal morphology evolves over time. Popular antifungal drugs, such as azoles, have morphology-specific mechanisms of action [20] and different fungal morphologies have been noted to be future antifungal targets [21]. We need a more quantitative, temporal, and morphology-specific evaluation of fungal growth to further mechanistic understanding of both differential growth of filamentous fungi and a drug’s antifungal activity. Several previous studies have calculated fungal growth rates to quantitatively evaluate temporal changes in fungal growth in different experimental conditions [22–25]. Growth rates specific to a fungal morphology ( morphology-specific growth rates ), such as germination rates of fungal spores or proliferation rates of hyphae, can be estimated from morphology-specific growth data to evaluate morphology-specific changes in fungal growth over time. For example, hyphal extension rates have been derived from hyphal microscopy data to investigate hyphae-specific growth defects in mutant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus [22]. Such morphology-specific growth rates can also be estimated from mechanistic models of fungal growth fit to directly measured time-course data. For example, hyphal growth rates have been estimated using a fungal growth model fit to hyphal area image data [26]. Mechanistic models that include morphology-specific growth mechanisms [23, 26, 27] can not only estimate morphology-specific growth rates, but also further understanding of morphological dynamics during growth [26]. However, to the best of our knowledge, estimating morphology-specific growth rates and developing mechanistic models of dynamic filamentous fungal growth are not routine in clinical microbiology laboratories potentially because it is too difficult to quickly collect the required time-course data that encapsulates morphological information or directly measures dynamic fungal growth. The acquisition and analysis of directly measured time-course morphology data requires specialist technology and analyses that lie beyond the scope of clinical microbiology laboratories. To collect morphology time-course data, fungal growth is directly measured over time using techniques such as enumerating colony forming units ( CFUs ), microscopy, or histology. These direct data collection methods are only feasible for large-scale experimentation in specialist research microbiology laboratories because of the high cost of technologies and skill-level required to perform automated direct measurement of fungal growth. Technological developments have been made to aide processing of fungal image data [25], such as FIJI [28] or fungal feature tracker ( FFT ) [29]. But they are either not fully automated, relying on point-and-click methods, or are still not used in clinical microbiology labs due to difficulty of use or implementation. Instead of directly measuring fungal growth to collect time-course fungal growth data, indirect measures of fungal growth can be obtained for growth rate estimation or mechanistic modelling by measuring optical density ( OD ). Collecting OD data is an automated, quick, and popular method to obtain time-dense fungal growth data that is widely used for estimating microbial growth rates [30] and is amenable to high-throughput phenotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility studies [31]. For fungi, the use of OD data to directly and empirically infer fungal growth rates is commonplace. Moreover, simple mechanistic models of fungal growth, such as logistic [32] and Gompertz [33] population growth models, have been directly fit to OD data to estimate fungal growth rates [23]. These simple mechanistic models could be extended to include morphology-specific growth mechanisms to estimate morphology-specific growth rates, as has been done with mechanistic models fit to directly measured data [26]. However, all these approaches to estimate growth rates from OD, both empirically or using modelling, harbour intrinsic inaccuracies because OD is an indirect measure of growth whereby changes in OD measurements may not even be reflective of true fungal growth and changes in fungal morphology are generally overlooked [11]. To collect data that has a higher fidelity to true fungal growth, OD data can be converted to a direct measure of growth using OD values at known fungal concentrations [34, 35] ( calibration ). However, it is difficult for clinical microbiology laboratories to routinely collect time-dense direct measures of fungal growth required for robust calibration because automated collection of such data is not yet standard. In this paper, we aim to model filamentous fungal growth and estimate morphology-specific fungal growth rates from OD measured at a wavelength of 600nm ( OD600 ) without collecting calibration data but still taking into consideration that OD is an indirect measure of growth. We proposed a model of fungal growth that treats measured OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration, thereby explicitly including calibration in the model structure. We demonstrate the model’s ability to fit to and predict OD600 using time-course OD600 data for the filamentous fungus, A. fumigatus, and evaluated the model’s estimated morphology-specific growth rate using directly measured data of A. fumigatus growth. 
 We obtained time-course OD600 data of fungal growth from an in vitro experiment of five initial inocula of uninucleate A. fumigatus spores ( 0, 2×102, 2×103, 2×104 and 2×105 spores ) suspended in 200μl of fungal ( f ) Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) media ( 0, 1, 101, 102 and 103 [nuclei ( N ) /μl] ) ( Fig 1a ). We also collected two sets of directly measured A. fumigatus growth time-course data: the hyphal length ( HL, Fig 1b ) and nuclear count ( NC, Fig 1c ). HLs ( μm ) were measured using the software ImageJ [36] from microscopy images of wells using an initial inoculum of 1 [N/μl]. NC data was obtained by imaging a fluorescent strain of A. fumigatus with an initial inoculum of 101 [N/μl] and counting the nuclei per hypha using the particle counter method in ImageJ [36]. The growth curves of the OD600 data differ from those of the HL and NC data. The OD600 data demonstrated little-to-no growth in the first 15 hours for lower fungal inocula ( 0, 2×102 and 2×103 spores ) while the HL and NC data showed growth in the first 15 hours ( Fig 1a, b, c ). This discrepancy between OD and HL/NC data is due to the indirect nature of OD600 as a measure of fungal growth. The OD600 does not capture changes in fungal morphology, such as hyal elongation or nuclear division, that occur in the first 15 hours of growth. In contrast, the HL and NC data directly measure these changes in morphology. The HL and NC data show that A. fumatus grows rapidly in the first 15 hours and then slows down after 15 hours ( Fig 1, b, c ). The HL and NC data also show that A.umatus grows faster at higher inocula (2×104 and 2×105 spores ) than lower inocula (0 2×102 and 2×103 sp ) ( Fig 1, b, c ). The HL and NC data also show that A.umatus grows faster in higher media (101 and 103nuclei N /μl ) than lower media ( 0 and 1nucle N /l ) ( Fig 1, b, c ). The OD600 data does not capture these differences in growth rates and media or inocula ( Fig 1a ) because OD is an indirect measure of growth. Our proposed model treats OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration, thereby accounting for the indirect nature of OD. The model includes a linear relationship between OD600 and the true fungal concentration. The model is based on the logistic growth equation [32], which is widely used to describe microbial growth. The logistic equation is a mechanistic model that describes growth rate as a function of time and concentration. The logistic equation is given by dCdt = rC(1−C)KC, where C is the concentration at time t, r is the maximum growth rate, K is the carrying capacity, and is the initial concentration. The logistic equation can be rewritten in terms of OD as dODdt = rOD(1−OD)KOD, where OD is the OD at time t, r is the growth rate, K is the carrying capacity, and is the initial OD. The model includes a linear relationship between OD and the true concentration. The linear relationship is given by OD =αC+β, where α is the intercept and β is the slope. The model combines the logistic equation and linear relationship as dODdt =rOD(1−OD)K+α+β. The model parameters r, K, α, and β are estimated by fitting the model to the time-course OD data. The model is a mechanistic because it describes growth as a function of time and includes the indirect nature of OD. The model does not require calibration data because the linear relationship between OD and true concentration is included in the model. The model was fit to the time-course OD data of A. fumatus using the five initial inocula (0 2×102 2×103 2×104 and 2×105 spores ) and media ( 0 1 101 102 and 103nucle N /l ) ( Fig 2 ). The model estimated parameters r, K, α, and β are shown in Table 1. The model fits the OD data well and captures the differences in growth rates and media and inocula ( Fig 2 ). The model captures the rapid growth in the first 15 hours and slowing after 15 hours ( Fig 2 ) The model also captures the faster growth at higher inocula (2× and 2 sp ) and higher media (101 and 103ucle N /l ) ( Fig 2. The model estimated morphology-specific rates are shown in Table

    Title: 
    Article: Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes. Most species have XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms are also common in some groups. We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and utilize eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. We identify ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share a conserved set of genes across beetles. While the ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, we find independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes evolve the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including the evolution of dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression. Beetles thus provide a novel model to gain a better understanding of the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution. 
 The order Coleoptera ( beetles ) is the most species-rich group of animals, with well over 400, 000 described taxa. Cytogenetic investigations across thousands of beetle species have revealed a rich diversity of karyotypes. Chromosome numbers vary more than in many other insect groups, suggesting high rates of chromosomal fusions and fissions [1, 2]. Cytogenetic analysis has shown that most species harbor X and Y chromosomes, but X0 sex determination is also common among some groups [3]. In particular, information on sex determination is available for over 4500 beetle species, and 93% of species reported show genetic sex determination ( 17% are X0 and 75% have XY sex chromosomes ). Haplodiploidy and paternal genome elimination is found in only 10 species ( 0. 2% ), and parthenogenesis has been found for 7% of the species investigated [2]. In several clades, fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes have been reported, creating so called neo-sex chromosomes [4–6]. Beetle sex chromosome karyotypes are typically inferred from testis squashes, and often reported as XY, X0, and Xy+ [2, 7]. XY sex chromosomes typically undergo synapsis during meiosis and can recombine in their pseudoautosomal region in males ( but note that achiasmatic male meiosis has evolved in some groups [2, 7] ). Xy+ sex chromosomes, on the other hand, pair at a distance with no synapsis and no opportunity for recombination during male meiosis [2, 7]. Despite a rich cytogenetic literature [4], surprisingly little is known about chromosome synteny and karyotype evolution at the molecular level. In particular, it is unclear how well chromosome synteny is conserved in Coleoptera. In Drosophila, and across Diptera, ancestral linkage groups are maintained, and termed ‘Muller elements’ [8]. Gene content of Muller elements is highly conserved and chromosome numbers are relatively stable across flies. Whether similar chromosomal elements exist in beetles, and how broadly they are conserved across the beetle phylogeny, is unclear. Additionally, while chromosomal sex determination is generally conserved across beetles, it is unclear whether the identity of sex chromosomes is conserved. For example, Diptera generally have XY sex chromosomes, but genomic analysis revealed tremendous hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes among flies, with numerous transitions of sex chromosomes, or incorporations of autosomes into the ancestral sex chromosome [9]. The X chromosome appears to be conserved in some beetles [10–12] but this has not been explored rigorously using broad phylogenetic sampling. Sex chromosomes follow unique evolutionary trajectories, with Y chromosomes losing most of their ancestral genes, and X chromosomes, in some taxa, evolving dosage compensation. Sex chromosomes originated from initially homologous chromosomes, and Y chromosomes degenerate due to their lack of recombination which renders natural selection less efficient [13, 14]. In response to Y degeneration, mechanisms may evolve to balance reduced transcript levels of hemizygous X-linked genes in males and equalize transcript levels in males and females from the X and the autosomes ( i. e. dosage compensation ) [13, 14]. In addition, sex chromosomes sometimes show an excess/deficiency of genes with sex-biased expression, with X chromosomes becoming enriched for female-biased genes and depleted for male-biased genes [15]. Whether dosage compensation exists broadly in beetles is unclear and has only been explored in Tribolium castaneum [10, 16, 17]. Comparative analysis is needed to address the prevalence of these patterns and the evolutionary forces driving them across species. Here, we use genomic approaches to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. In particular, we generate a new chromosome-level assembly for Tribolium confusum and use published assemblies from eleven additional species spanning across the phylogeny, to broadly reconstruct sex chromosome and karyotype evolution in beetles ( Fig 1 ). In addition, we collect RNA-seq data from different tissues to explore functional changes on the more recently formed neo-sex chromosomes in T. confusum and Dendroctonus ponderosae, allowing us to explore the evolutionary trajectory of young sex chromosomes in beetles. 
 We used Nanopore and Illumina sequencing combined with Hi-C scaffolding to generate a high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of the confused flour beetle, T. confusum ( Fig 2A ). The total length of the assembly is 305, 133, 470 bp and we were able to annotate a total of 15, 231 protein coding genes ( Tables 1 and S1 ). We found the average GC content for the genome is 30. 72%. Repeat masking using our custom repeat library amounted to 147, 396, 050 bp ( 48. 31% ) of the draft genome being masked. Interestingly, we find the T. confusum genome assembly is ~140 Mb larger than the assembly of its relative T. castaneum, and these differences appear to be the result of an increase in repetitive elements that are broadly distributed across the genome of T. confusum ( Fig 2B ). Many repetitive elements are currently unclassified, but we find that DNA transposons make up over 10% of the genome assembly ( Table 2 ). Our assembly recovers the majority of chromosomes as a single scaffold ( Fig 2A and 2B ), and chromosome synteny is highly conserved between T. confusum and T. castaneum ( Fig 2C ). Note that we also assembled over 2 Mb of the repeat-rich Y chromosome and annotated 24 putative Y-linked genes ( Table 1; see S1 Note for some analysis on these genes ). T. confusum contains a neo-sex chromosome, that is, an autosome fused to the ancestral sex chromosome [5] and the neo-X chromosome of T. confusum is homologous to linkage group 2 of T. castaneum ( Fig 2C ). Neo-X and neo-Y chromosomes are initially homologous and diverge over time; the neo-Y chromosome degenerates and eventually loses nearly all homology with the neo-X [14]. Male and female genomic coverage analysis can be used to identify sex chromosomes and assess the level of homology between diverging sex chromosomes [9]. We find that genomic coverage, both for Illumina and Nanopore data, is about half for both the neo-X and the ancestral portion of the X chromosome in males compared to autosomes ( Figs 2D and S1 ), indicating that the neo-sex chromosomes are highly differentiated in T. confusum. We see evidence of gene shuffling within the neo-X and ancestral X portions of the T. confusum X chromosome but not between neo-X and ancestral X regions ( S2 Fig ). This suggests that a distinct boundary exists between the ancestral and neo-X ( such as a centromere ) that prevents shuffling of genes among those segments of the X chromosome ( S2 Fig ). To further explore the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes in beetles, we investigated the mountain pine beetle D. ponderosae [18], where females contain twelve pairs of chromosomes ( 11 autosomes, and a large neo-X chromosome ) [4]. Importantly, the ancestral part of the neo-X/X chromosome ( i. e., the part homologous to the X in T. castaneum ) shows half the coverage in males compared to females ( Fig 3B ) ; the neo-X ( that is, the part homologous to LG2 and LG4 of T. castaneum ), however, only shows a modest coverage reduction in males and is heterogenous across its length ( Fig 3B ). Thus, there is still considerable homology between the neo-X and neo-Y of D. ponderosae, indicating that the neo-sex chromosomes of the mountain pine beetle are likely considerably younger than that of the confused flour beetle. D. ponderosae ( Dpon ) and T. castaneum ( Tcas ) split over 200My ago [10, 11], yet show high levels of conservation of linkage groups ( Fig 3A ). To investigate the level of conservation of chromosome homologies across beetles, we utilized published chromosome-level assemblies from four additional beetle species: Pogonus chalceus ( Pcha ), Photinus pyralis ( Ppyr ), Propylea japonica (Pjap ), and Tribolium castaneum (Tcas ) ( Table S1 ). We found that linkage groups are conserved across beetles ( Fig 4 ), with Mull elements being highly conserved across all species ( S Fig 4 ). Mull elements are also conserved across the beetle phylogeny ( S Fig 4 ). Mull elements are conserved across the beetle phylogeny ( S Fig 4 ) Mull elements are conserved across the beetle phylogeny ( Fig 4 ) Mull elements are conserved across the phylogeny ( Fig 4 Mull elements are conserved across the phylogeny ( Fig 4 Mull are conserved across the phylog ( Fig 4 Mull are conserved the phylog ( Fig Mull are cons the phy ( Mull are cons ( Fig Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull cons ( are Mull cons ( are Mull cons ( Mull are cons ( Mull are cons Mull ( are Mull cons ( are Mull cons Mull are ( Mull are cons Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are Mull are

    Title: 
    Article: Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants. H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ). While H2A. Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation, htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits, previous work examining the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A. Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ). Furthermore, as H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions, a more substantive role for H2A. Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress. To explore this possibility, we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ), which induces DNA replication stress. Our data showed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, mapping H2A. Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with, but generally not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A. Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU. 
 Incorporation of histone variants is one of the principal mechanisms that cells use to create structurally and functionally distinct regions of chromatin. H2A. Z is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant in the H2A histone family [1]. Unlike H2A, which is produced in equal amounts to other core histones during S-phase, H2A. Z is encoded by replication-independent genes allowing for variant specific expression and deposition throughout the cell cycle [2]. Essential in higher eukaryotes, H2A. Z has been implicated in a large variety of biological functions including nucleosome turnover, maintenance of heterochromatin and euchromatin boundaries, DNA repair, resistance to genotoxic stress, and transcription regulation [1, 3]. It is therefore not surprising that disruption of proper H2A. Z incorporation has been widely connected to human health and disease including memory formation [4–8], development and progression of various cancers [9–14], and phenotypes of the rare genetic developmental disorder Floating Harbor Syndrome [15]. H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1-C ), a highly conserved ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeler [16–19]. Replacing H2A in 5–10% of nucleosomes, H2A. Z is primarily incorporated into the +1 nucleosome of the transcription start site ( TSS ) of approximately 63% of all genes in yeast [20–23]. Despite having very similar three-dimensional structures [24], in vitro and in vivo experiments provide strong evidence that H2A. Z containing nucleosomes are less stably bound in chromatin than H2A containing nucleosomes [25–30]. However, it is now understood that the impact of H2A. Z on chromatin dynamics is highly contingent on the organism and the nucleosomal context. For example, H2A. Z heterotypic nucleosomes ( H2A-H2A. Z-containing ) are more stable than H2A. Z homotypic nucleosomes ( H2A. Z-H2A. Z-containing ) [28, 31], and the presence of other histone variants or histone post-translational modifications can further modify histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions [32–34]. In addition to affecting nucleosome stability, H2A. Z occupancy in mammalian models correlates with various transcription-related histone post-translational modifications, such as H3K4 methylation, further indicating a role for H2A. Z in gene expression regulation [3]. While these previous findings suggest a strong relationship between H2A. Z function and gene expression, the role of H2A. Z in transcription regulation has remained a long-standing enigma within the field, particularly in S. cerevisiae. One compelling model suggests that H2A. Z occupancy promotes gene activation by facilitating the disassembly of the +1 nucleosome, thereby promoting RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) initiation and elongation [35]. However, microarray experiments in budding yeast have challenged this notion, finding that less than 5% of genes are differentially expressed in the htz1Δ mutant in steady-state conditions despite H2A. Z being enriched at the majority of gene promoters [18, 22, 36–38]. Additionally, previous studies have found no broad correlation between H2A. Z occupancy and gene expression levels, with many H2A. Z-dependent genes exhibiting relatively limited H2A. Z enrichment at their promoter [18, 22, 23]. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that H2A. Z primarily regulates genes expression during the transcriptional response to cellular stress and changes in environment [3, 39]. For example, the htz1Δ mutant has defective activation of several inducible genes such as GAL1, PHO5, and IMD2 [40–42] and H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects when exposed to stress conditions [1]. This then raises the intriguing possibility that the relationship between H2A. Z incorporation and gene activation in S. cerevisiae may only be fully elucidated after a change in environment or the introduction of a cellular stress. H2A. Z mutants are sensitive to several genotoxic agents including hydroxyurea ( HU ) [42, 43], a non-alkylating antineoplastic commonly used to induce DNA replication stress. By increasing the cellular abundance of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and disrupting the production of deoxyribonucleotides ( dNTPs ), HU activity ultimately leads to cell cycle arrest and DNA damage checkpoint activation [44–46]. Given that the onset of replication stress results in dynamic and substantial changes to the transcriptome [47] and that H2A. Z incorporation is required for proper cell cycle progression ( Dhillon et al., 2006; Long et al., 2019 ), we hypothesized that HU exposure would exacerbate gene expression differences in htz1Δ mutants and could clarify the relationship between H2A. Z enrichment and gene expression [48, 49]. HU exposure also provides the unique opportunity to examine the curious relationship between SWR1-C and H2A. Z. SWR1-C is required for the incorporation of H2A. Z into chromatin, but deletion of its catalytic subunit, Swr1, produces less severe growth defects during cellular stress compared to htz1Δ mutants [16–18]. Furthermore, htz1Δswr1Δ mutants have similar growth phenotypes to swr1Δ mutants, suggesting that the larger growth defects of htz1Δ mutants can be attributed to deleterious activity of SWR1-C missing its H2A. Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ) [42]. Given the growth phenotypes associated with this phenomenon are highly pronounced in HU [42], HU exposure could also serve as a valuable means to determine if the htz1Δ mutant’s gene expression patterns are influenced by the presence of apo-SWR1-C. In an effort to uncover the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation in S. cerevisiae, we examined the mRNA transcript profiles of htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants in both untreated and HU-treated conditions. Analysis of six biological replicates revealed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than gene repression during HU exposure, and that H2A. Z incorporation was important for wild-type expression of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that both the swr1Δ and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants had less severe gene expression defects compared to the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis. Furthermore, by mapping H2A. Z incorporation at a single-nucleosome resolution before and after HU exposure, we found that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites correlated with, but was generally not required for, increased mRNA expression of HU-activated genes. Taken together these results indicate that to effectively examine the role of H2A. Z in transcription regulation, it is important to account for the confounding effects of SWR-C when its H2. substrate is absent, and that H2. may play a more significant role in gene activation than previously thought, particularly in response to cellular stress. 
Here is a clear, accurate, and formal summary of the article:

Title: Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are modulated by the incorporation of histone variant H2Z, encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene in S. cerevisiae, an evolutionarily conserved H2 histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex (SW-C). While H2Z has been implicated in transcription regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given growth defects of ht1 mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW-C subunits, previous examining the role of HZ in gene regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW-C when its HZ substrate (apoSW-C) is missing. Furthermore, HZ mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, a more substantive role HZ in gene may be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress. To explore this possibility, we generated mRNA profiles for wild, ht1, sw1, and ht1sw mutants before and after exposure to hydroxya (H), which induces replication stress. Our data showed HZ played a prominent role in gene activation during H exposure and its incorporation was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. We also observed apo-SW contributed to expression in ht mutants, particularly genes involved in phosphate regulation. Furthermore, HZ incorporation before and after treatment with H revealed decreases H enrichment at transcription sites correlated with, but not required, upregulation genes during H exposure. This study characterized the effects ofZ incorporation during transcriptional response H.

The article discusses the role of histone variant HZ in regulating gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HZ is an evolutionarily conserved histone that is incorporated into chromatin by the SW complex, a highly conserved ATP-dependent chrom-remodel. Unlike other histones, HZ is encoded by replication-independent genes, allowing for specific expression throughout the cell cycle. In higher eukaryotes, H has been implicated in various functions, including nucleosome maintenance, heterochatin and euchatin boundaries, DNA repair, and transcription. Disruption of H incorporation has been connected to health and disease, including formation, development of cancers, and phenotypes of rare genetic disorder Floating Syndrome. In S cerevisiae, H is encoded by nonessential gene HT1 and incorporated into chrom by SW-C. Replacing H in-10% nucleosomes, H is primarily incorporated into + nucleosome of transcription site of 63% genes. Despite similar structures, in vitro and vivo provide evidence that H-containing nucleosomes are stably in chrom than H-containing nucleosomes. The impact of H on chrom dynamics is contingent on organism and nucle context. For example, H heterotypic nucle (H-HZ-containing) are more stable than homotypic nucle (HZ-containing). The presence other histones or hist postl modifications modify hist-hist and hist-DNA interactions. In addition to affecting stability, H occupancy in mammalian correlates with transcription-related post modifications, indicating role in regulation. While previous suggest relationship between H function and expression, role in regulation has remained enigma, particularly in S cerevis. One model suggests H promotes activation by disassembling + nucleosome, promoting RNA polymerase initiation and elongation. However, experiments have challenged this, finding less genes differentially expressed in ht mutants in steady conditions despite H being at majority promoters. Additionally, have no correlation between H and expression, many H-dependent exhibiting limited H at promoters. However, evidence suggests H regulates expression during transcriptional response cellular and environment. For example, ht mutants defective several inducible genes and H mutants display growth in conditions. This raises possibility that relationship

    Title: 
    Article: Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells. Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data, it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand. To overcome this challenge, automated classification methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution, we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations. The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point, a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset. We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. Moreover, we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods. We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels, as commonly observed in developmental processes. We show, on simulated and real datasets, that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data, and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data. Finally, we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data, and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods. 
 The field of developmental biology aims to unravel the mechanisms that underlie the transformation of a single-cell into a complex multicellular organism. This process encompasses molecular, cellular, and tissue-level dynamics. To measure this diversity of processes, several complementary acquisition methods are available [1]. In particular scRNASeq methods make it possible to establish a transcriptomic profile for each cell, i. e. a measure of the quantity of RNA associated with each gene [2]. In practice, this transcriptomic profile is, for each cell, a vector of high dimension ( generally of the order of 20, 000: the number of genes considered ), such that each of the coordinates of this vector represents the number of RNA molecules measured associated with a given gene. Because of their high dimensionality, scRNAseq datasets cannot be explored by hand. Therefore several methodological approaches have been proposed to make sense of these datasets. Particularly, several nonlinear dimension reduction methods have been developed, with the aim of preserving the structure of the data and allowing the identification of subcategories with a biological rationale [3–5]. In addition, a number of methods aim at reconstructing how these data points evolve over time, through the task of trajectory inference [6, 7]. Moreover, some works have sought to infer the structure of these datasets by making explicit their link with the spatial organization of cells [8]. Overall, scRNASeq datasets have proven very useful to answer a variety of questions in particular in developmental biology [9, 10]. The main remaining limitations come from the fact that transcriptomic profiles do not usually contain temporal and precise spatial information [11], and manual annotation of individual cell profiles can be tedious, time-consuming and require expert knowledge [12]. Because of the rapid accumulation of data, one of the major challenges currently is to perform accurate automated annotation of single-cell RNASeq datasets into accurate cell types [12–15]. Annotation strategies rely on the establishment of large atlases and expert knowledge, as well as transfer learning strategies for the use of already annotated datasets to newly generated ones. While often gene markers can be used to identify unambiguously a given cell type, in some cases, the annotation remains partial with an ambiguity that cannot be resolved by known a priori information [9]. We propose in this paper to take advantage of partial label learning strategies for the problem of automated single-cell transcriptomics profile annotation. The idea of partial label learning [16] consists in the task of multiclass classification, where, instead of a single label per sample, a set of candidate labels is given per sample, among which only one is correct. One of the application of this approach consists in the case when even with expert knowledge on known marker genes, it is not possible to perform single-cell annotation as it is the case for C. elegans [9]. The second class of applications concerns the situation where a reference atlas exists, providing sufficient information for establishing sets of candidate labels for each transcriptomic profile, but not sufficient for a single-cell resolution annotation ( because of time, cost, and computational limitations ). In this paper, we establish and address the challenge of resolving partially annotated single-cell transcriptomics profile by solving a partial label learning problem. We compare various implementations of the problem that we test both in simulated data and experimental data. We focus in particular on the question of labels with a hierarchy, such as the ones that can be found in developing and differentiating systems [12, 17–21]. This leads us to a benchmark of partial hierarchical labeling methods adapted from classical approaches to the problem of partial labels. From the machine learning point of view, the problems we want to solve are hierarchical classification problems with partially labeled training data. Partial label learning has been studied in a variety of real-world learning scenarios, including automatic face naming [22, 23], web mining [24], and multimedia content analysis [23]. Researchers have proposed various approaches to tackle the partial label learning problem using well-known machine learning techniques. These techniques include maximum likelihood estimation [25], convex optimization [16], k-nearest neighbors [22, 25] and more. While maximum margin methods ( e. g. SVM ) are a powerful solution to such a partial labeling setting [26, 27], we will investigate prototype-based methods, nearest neighbor, logistic regression and ensemble methods as well to provide a comparative study of a wide spectrum of methods. Similarly, hierarchical classification has been addressed by many approaches in the machine learning community and in particular for extreme classification ( hierarchical classification with a very large number of labels ) [28]. Hierarchical classification has been intensively studied for image data [29] and textual data [30]. Yet the research in this area has mainly focused on specific application contexts for these data, large-scale problems ( in the number of classes and in the number of data ) [28–32], hierarchical multilabel classification, discovery of a hierarchy underlying the data [30]. In comparison, few works have been concerned with learning from small datasets and/or with partial label in a framework similar to ours [33, 34]. For example, [33, 34] proposed an EM-like approach but dedicated to textual data and for a limited number of labels organized in a very flat hierarchy ( of height equal to 2 or 3 ). We will investigate and compare several methods from various families of approaches to solve our classification problems on biological data: a SVM-based approach ( e. g. [35, 36] ), a prototype-based approach originally inspired from [37], a kNN-based approach, logistic regression [38] and ensemble methods such as Random Forest [39] and Extreme Gradient Boosting Methods [40, 41]. We will consider three different settings: standard supervised multiclass classification, multiclass classification with partially labeled data, hierarchical classification with partially labeled data. While the methods are naturally available for the standard supervised multiclass classification setting, we will use variants to the two other settings, when available, or propose an extension otherwise. 
 The problem of automatically classifying partially labeled transcriptomic profiles is summarized in Fig 1. The task we are interested in may be viewed as a multi-class classification problem where samples x ∈ X belong to a set of labels Y that may be organized in a hierarchy. Here we consider X = R d and we note | Y | = c. We explored several settings, that we briefly describe now. We investigated several families of methods: Support Vector Machines based methods ( SVM ) ; Logistic Regression ( LR ), Nearest Neighbor methods ( kNN ), Prototype-based methods ( PB ) and ensemble-based methods ( Random forest ( RF ) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Methods ( XGBM ) ). We first explain in a generic way, independently of the classification model, how we handled the partially supervised setting. We then detail how we handled the hierarchical information to perform hierarchical classification. We note fW a classification model ( e. g. a SVM ) parameterized by a set of parameters W, fW ( x ) the class output by model fW for a sample x, score ( fW, x, c ) the score for model fW, class c and sample x ( in particular f W ( x ) = arg max c s c o r e ( f W, x, c ) ). Finally, we note loss ( fW, x, y ) the loss computed for a model fW and a labeled training sample ( x, y ). To start with, in the basic supervised multiclass classification problem, when the dataset includes supervised samples only, the solution is usually handled by an optimization problem of the form: arg min W Ω ( W ) + μ l ∑ i = 1 l l o s s ( f W, x i, y i ) ( 1 ) where Ω ( W ) is a regularizer and l s ( W, x, y ) the loss for a sample ( x, y ). In the partially labeled setting, we have a set of candidate labels for each sample x i, Y i = { y i 1,....., y k i }, where only one is correct. We propose to extend the optimization problem to: min W Ω ( W ) μ ∑ i = 1 k l o s ( W, x i, y j ) ( 2 where j = 1,...., k. In the hierarchical setting, we have a hierarchy of labels Y = { y 1,...., y c } where y i is a parent of y j if y i y j. We propose to extend the optimization to: min Ω ( W ) μ ∑ i = 1 l o ( W, x, y i ) ( 3 where i = 1,..., c In the following, we detail how we implemented the methods for each of the three settings. In the supervised multiclass setting, we used standard SVM, LR, kNN, PB, RF, and XGB. In the partially labeled setting, we used SVM, LR, kNN, PB, RF, and XGB. In the hierarchical setting we used SVM, LR, kNN, PB, RF, and XGB. In the following, we detail how we implemented the methods for each of the three settings.

    Title: 
    Article: The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli. Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. Intriguingly, the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent. We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture. In this study, we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry. We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. Moreover, these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. Thus, we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression. 
 Differentially phosphorylated inositol headgroups of different phosphoinositides ( PIPs ) serve as a recognition code for the recruitment of a plethora of interacting proteins [1–4]. PIPs are typically embedded in eukaryotic cell membranes where they regulate processes such as vesicular trafficking, actin polymerization, or autophagy [5, 6]. The pioneering work on identifying the presence of PIPs in the cell nucleus was done several decades ago [7–10] but is now receiving increasing attention. One of the most widely studied nuclear PIPs is phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ). PIP2 localizes to nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and small nucleoplasmic structures called nuclear lipid islets ( NLIs ) [11, 12]. Nuclear PIPs are involved in gene expression [2, 11, 13]. In particular, nuclear PIP2 regulates transcription by affecting the condensation capacity of the RNA Pol2 initiation complex [14]. Interestingly, nuclear compartments containing PIP2, such as the aforementioned nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nucleoplasmic transcription initiation foci, are formed by the process of phase separation [15–21]. The phase separation-driven formation of membraneless compartments, sometimes referred to as ’biomolecular condensates’, is associated with enhanced kinetics of biochemical reactions in the living cell [22–25]. The formation of these compartments provides high local concentrations of reaction components and forms diffusion barriers that serve as adsorption catalyst surfaces [26]. In addition, biomolecular condensates allow the sequential progression of processes through the successive coupling of subsequent reactions in multilayered compartmentalized reaction chambers, such as ribosomal biogenesis in nucleoli, packaging of hnRNP particles in Cajal bodies, or the involvement of nuclear speckles in pre-mRNA splicing [17, 27–29]. The formation of phase-separated biomolecular condensates can be mathematically described and computationally modeled using the theory of stickers and linkers [30]. Stickers are local modules that allow multivalent intra- and intermolecular interactions and are represented by classical globular domains of proteins or by stretches of charged amino acids connected by flexible linker regions in intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) [31, 32]. Condensation of IDR-containing proteins is often driven by charged amino acid stretches within IDRs [33–35]. In addition, it has been previously described that changes in net charge and amino acid types within an IDR can even navigate proteins to different core regions [33]. Thus, both the amino acid composition and the posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ), which together generate the charge pattern of the IDR, are important determinants of sub-nuclear protein localization [35]. Electrostatic interactions appear to be fundamental determinants of condensate properties [36, 37]. Thus, negatively charged polymeric molecules such as RNA are important factors in the formation and dissolution of some nuclear condensates. Indeed, the biomolecular condensates in the nucleus are typically formed by low-affinity multivalent interactions between proteins and RNA [38, 39]. RNA has a positive or negative effect on condensate formation, depending on the situation and the type of RNA [40–42]. The short RNA molecules buffer and thus reduce the local tendency to form a condensate. Conversely, longer RNA molecules often increase condensate formation [40, 41, 43, 44]. In addition, PTMs such as phosphorylation are another important regulatory step affecting condensate formation or dissolution [18, 33, 40, 45]. The interaction between higher-order folded RNA and lipid molecules has been suggested previously [21, 46–52]. Higher-order RNA has a scaffolding function that brings together RNA-binding proteins to form nuclear subcompartments [53–57]. The formation of these RNA folds depends on intra- and intermolecular double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) duplexes. However, a general mechanism or identification of common mechanistic principles has been lacking. We hypothesized that negatively charged nuclear PIPs are interesting candidates for the regulation of biomolecular condensation via phase separation. PIPs provide a platform for the recruitment of interacting proteins, thereby increasing their local concentration. RNA and PIPs may cooperate in the formation of condensates, such as in the process of influenza virus particle biogenesis [58]. PIPs carry a negative charge, which could ultimately alter the overall net charge of condensates and thus influence condensate formation and size. Therefore, the possible spatial interplay between nuclear PIPs and RNA in regulating condensation seems plausible. Indeed, a recent study showed that not only proteins and RNA but also metabolites including phospholipids ( e. g., PIPs ) are enriched in condensates [59]. We have previously shown that RNA is important for nuclear PIP2 levels, as RNA removal by RNase A dramatically decreased the PIP2 signal measured by immunofluorescence [11]. In the current study, we speculate that the higher-order RNA might be responsible for the correct localization of PIP2 in the eukaryotic nucleus. Therefore, we used bacterial RNase III, normally associated with siRNA processing, to remove short dsRNA regions followed by quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) proteomic analysis of the nuclear fraction. We identified the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome and performed bioinformatic analyses of the physicochemical properties of the identified proteins. Subsequently, we proposed and successfully validated a model in which nuclear PIP2 may serve as a recognition motif that regulates the formation of Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 protein ) foci. These are known to form by phase separation and to compartmentalize and concentrate the transcriptional apparatus. Thus, PIP2 may play an important role in the establishment of nuclear architecture. Our results suggest a molecular mechanism in which PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge for the recruitment of the lysin/arginine ( K/R ) motif-containing RDPA protein BRD4 by higher-order RNA molecules. This presumably leads to local regulation of the condensation potential, as manifested by different numbers of BRD4 foci when PIP2 levels are high. Nuclear PIP2 levels may therefore dictate where certain RDPA proteins accumulate and potentially form condensate. Thus, changes in the localization and condensation potential of RDPA proteins could affect the rates of the biochemical reactions involved. Taken together, our data demonstrated the formation of a specific type of biomolecular condensates via the association of complexes formed by RNA, proteins, and PIP2, and are therefore relevant to our understanding of the principles underlying the establishment of functional nuclear compartments.

    Title: 
    Article: Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation, yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood. The Scarabaeinae, or true dung beetles, are a species-rich clade of insects recognized for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development including that of cephalic horns—evolutionarily novel, secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation. Here, we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays. We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini ( > 2500 extant species ) including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development, including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination. Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions. Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group. 
 Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes in response to environmental variation and constitutes a ubiquitous property of multicellular life [1]. Plasticity is thought to be an important driver of adaptation, allowing organisms to maintain high fitness in the face of environmental variability, as well as of diversification via evolutionary changes in the genetic architectures underlying plastic trait formation [2]. The ecological and evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity has received much attention, and diverse genes and signal transduction pathways have been identified as important mediators of plastic development across biological systems [3]. In addition to coding sequence, epigenetic modifications such as histone marking are predicted to provide important mechanisms of plastic gene expression regulation ( for reviews, see refs [4–5] ). Further, recent quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis combined with genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 has begun to establish first causal connections between several cis-regulatory elements and the plastic development of nematode feeding structures [6]. Yet despite these advances, the genomic basis underlying developmental plasticity and its evolution, and in particular the role of the non-coding genome and chromatin architecture in regulating conditional responses in trait formation, remain largely unknown. One group of animals that exhibit an extreme degree of phenotypic plasticity are the true dung beetles ( Scarabaeinae ), a hyper-diverse clade ( >6000 extant species ) [7] found on every continent except Antarctica. The extraordinary evolutionary success of this group is attributable at least in part to their ability to exploit an abundant resource inaccessible to most other insects–dung. For nearly every species, the acquisition and utilization of dung is essential to each aspect of their life history. This includes not only consuming dung as a food source ( coprophagy ), but also as a resource for larval food provisioning and nest construction, thereby enabling a single offspring to complete development from egg to adult within the confines of an underground brood ball. One key adaptation aiding in this strategy is a highly diversified degree of nutrition-responsive ( plastic ) development. In the case of dung beetles, nutrition-responsive development is a flexible developmental response to variable and limited larval food quality and quantity, resulting in a wide range of adult body sizes, which in turn has fueled the evolution of alternative, body size-dependent morphological, physiological, and behavioral phenotypes [8]. Accordingly, phenotypic plasticity is predicted to be an evolutionary driver for many dung beetle adaptations. Furthermore, due to their diversity, abundance, pronounced environment-sensitive development, and unique feeding and reproductive traits, dung beetles have thus long served as important models for behavioral ( e. g. status dependent selection and sperm competition models [9, 10] ), developmental ( e. g. mechanisms of plasticity [11, 12] ), evolutionary ( e. g. the origins of evolutionary novelties [13] ), and ecological studies ( e. g. meta-population theory [14], nutrient recycling, soil aeration [15, 16] ). However, despite the significance of dung beetles in both basic and applied science, a reference-quality genomic resource for any member of this insect group has so far been lacking and thus limited studies examining the genetic basis for dung beetle traits and adaptations. Among the most conspicuous morphological trait of dung beetles are head horns—novel, highly diversified secondary sexual weapons used in reproductive competition [17]. Horns vary tremendously in shape, size, and number across and within species, mediate widespread sexual dimorphisms, and exhibit a high degree of nutrition-responsive development among conspecific males [18]. Most commonly, horn development is limited to, and often exaggerated, in males while females are hornless, though in some species both sexes may develop horns or–on rare occasions–horn development may be sex-reversed and more pronounced in females [19]. Here, nutrition responsiveness of horn formation provides an important axis of diversification, with horn size-body size scaling relationships ranging from isometric to positively allometric ( exaggerated ) to polyphenic. In polyphenic species, larval nutrition channels male development toward one of two alternate, and discretely different ontogenetic outcomes: fully horned major males ( which as adults engage in aggressive combat to secure matings ) or smaller-sized, nearly fully hornless minor males ( which engage in sneaking tactics and sperm competition ) [17, 19]. Intriguingly, head horns lack homology to any other appendage or body part [20], and as such qualify as an evolutionary novelty even by the strictest of definitions [21], yet gains, losses, and modifications to horn structure are common among even closely related species [22]. Thus, beetle horns exhibit a high degree of evolutionary lability and represent a powerful natural system for understanding how complex traits originate and diversify [12, 13, 20, 22]. In this study, we begin by assembling and annotating chromosome-level genome assemblies for three Onthophagine dung beetle species: Onthophagus taurus, Onthophagus sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella ( Fig 1A ). The Onthophagini is a highly speciose ( ~ 2500 extant species ) tribe of dung beetles found worldwide and includes one of the most species-rich genera on Earth, Onthophagus [23]. Through a series of whole genome alignments and comparative genomic assays including other published beetle genomes, we identify sequence gains and changes putatively associated with adaptations unique to dung beetle ecology and evolution. We then utilize these three reference genomes to investigate the role of the non-coding genome in the development and evolution of sex- and nutrition-dependent horn formation across our three focal species. We chose these three species because collectively they embody a remarkable diversity in head horn development reflective of much of the diversity contained within the clade, including: a highly exaggerated sexual dimorphism and male polyphenism in O. taurus; a rare example of sex-reversed horn development in O. sagittarius females paralleled by a secondary loss of horn polyphenism in males; and a modest sexual dimorphism and male polyphenism in the more distantly related D. gazella thought to reflect ancestral character states ( Fig 1B ). Specifically, we apply genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays to investigate the cis-regulatory basis for sex- and nutrition-biased horn formation in O. taurus and provide some of the first evolutionary insights into the chromatin architecture underlying nutrition-dependent morph determination and developmental plasticity broadly. Our approach and results open new ways of understanding how gene networks may evolve to generate novel structures and regulate environment-responsive development. 
 Chromosome-level scaffolds were constructed for each beetle species using a two-step assembly strategy: PacBio HiFi long read contig assembly followed by HiC proximity ligation sequencing. Importantly, each species’ assembly was generated and annotated using identical sequencing and bioinformatic pipelines ( see Methods and Materials for details ), minimizing technical bias during cross-species comparisons. The O. taurus assembly is 290. 0 Mb in length and is composed of 53. 3% repetitive elements ( Fig 1C ). Interestingly, the closely related O. sagittarius genome assembly is nearly twice as large ( 553. 3 Mb ), which is almost entirely attributable to expansion of non-coding, primarily repetitive ( 69. 1% of assembly ), sequence. The D. gazella assembly, on the other hand, revealed only a modest increase in genome size ( 327. 3 Mb ) relative to O. taurus. High contiguity and BUSCO single copy scores ( 97. 1–98. 9% ) alongside low BUSCO duplication scores ( 0. 4–1. 0% ) suggest accurate reference genome assemblies were achieved for each species ( Fig 1C ). The O. taurus, O. sagittarius, and D. gazella genomes were compared to seven other beetle genomes across the order Coleoptera to identify evolutionary changes in coding and noncoding sequence associated with adaptations to dung ecology and evolution ( Fig 2 ). We found that the Onophagus and Digitophagus lineages exhibit significant expansions of non-coding sequence, particularly in the form of transposons and retrotransposons ( Fig 2A ). Notably, O sagitt and Della genomes contain a higher proportion of retrotranspos than O. taurus ( Fig 2B ). In contrast, O taurus and Della exhibit a higher proportion of transpos than O sag ( Fig 2 ). These expansions of noncoding elements are associated with adaptations to dung ecology and evolution in Onoph and Digitagus lineages ( Fig 2 ). We next investigated chromatin accessibility in developing head tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. t males and females using ATAC-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP sequencing ( Fig 3 ). Our results reveal distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- and sex-dependent horn development in O. t ( Fig 4 ), including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn determination ( Fig 5 ). Binding of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in nutrition-responsive chromatin regions ( Fig 6 ). These findings highlight the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits and demonstrate gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. Our study provides new-quality reference genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group.

    Title: 
    Article: The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered, particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death. Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease, we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. By contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome. These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome. 
 Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus ( LASV ), an Old-World mammarenavirus of the Arenaviridae family [1]. The disease is endemic to West Africa, particularly Nigeria, Benin, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. In these countries, and more particularly in Nigeria and Benin, outbreaks of Lassa fever occur frequently, with lethality rates ranging from 15 to 30% [2, 3]. Sporadic cases are also detected in neighboring countries, such as Ghana, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Burkina Faso [4–6]. LASV is transmitted to humans through contact with its natural reservoir, the peridomestic rodent Mastomys natalensis, or material contaminated with the excreta of these rodents, but alternative reservoirs have also been described [7]. No vaccine has been licensed to date, and the only antiviral drug available, ribavirin, has a very low efficacy or is completely ineffective [8, 9]. Lassa fever is, therefore, a major public health issue in West Africa and has been listed by the WHO as an epidemic threat requiring urgent preparedness. The severity of Lassa fever ranges from asymptomatic infection in a large proportion of patients, to a fatal viral hemorrhagic fever. The disease begins with nonspecific signs, such as fever, asthenia, myalgia, headache, anorexia, abdominal pain, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea. Facial and/or neck edema, conjunctivitis, hemorrhages, neurological signs, and acute respiratory distress are then observed in patients with severe disease, and death occurs in a context of multiorgan failure [10]. Patients surviving acute disease may experience sequelae, such as pericarditis, deafness and ataxia [11, 12]. LASV is a viral species displaying genetic diversity, with seven lineages described to date, corresponding to different areas of circulation of the virus [13]. Lineages 1, 2, and 3 circulate in Nigeria, lineage 4 is found in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, lineage 5 has been described in Mali and Côte d’Ivoire, and lineage 7 predominates in Togo and Benin [4, 14–16]. By contrast, lineage 6 has been isolated only from rodents [7]. All LASV strains can cause fatal disease in humans, and it remains unclear whether there are differences in the pathogenicity of the various strains in patients. However, in the cynomolgus monkey model, the different lineages seem to induce disease with different severities [17–19]. As both patient access and the handling of LASV patient samples are very limited, animal models are crucial to understand the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the events enabling some patients to control LASV and leading to catastrophic illness and death in others. LASV has a preferential tropism for antigen-presenting cells ( APC ), dendritic cells and macrophages, potentially accounting for the rapid transfer of the virus from site of local infection to secondary lymphoid organs ( SLOs ) [20, 21]. However, this tropism does not seem to favor the induction of LASV-specific T-cell responses [22–24]. The replication of LASV in SLOs is followed by systemic dissemination to almost all organs during severe Lassa fever in cynomolgus monkeys, whereas the spread of the virus appears to be restricted to a few organs in surviving animals [17, 20, 25]. We and others have shown that LASV strains belonging to lineage 5, such as AV and Soromba [5, 16], cause less severe disease than the Josiah strain in cynomolgus monkeys [18, 26]. We have recently developed a cynomolgus monkey model that reproduces the different outcomes of Lassa fever observed in humans [25]. Infecting animals with the Josiah and AV strains of LASV at the same dose and via the same route of inoculation leads to uniformly fatal Lassa fever and non-severe disease and survival, respectively. We have shown that, following its initial replication at the inoculation site, LASV reaches the SLOs, where it displays significant levels of replication in all animals. However, the dynamics of viral dissemination then differ strikingly between outcomes. LASV displays no significant further spread in surviving animals, whereas systemic viral dissemination and replication is observed in animals with fatal disease, leading to a cytokine/chemokine storm and multiple organ failure closely resembling that observed in septic shock syndrome. Here, we further analyzed the dynamics and tropism of these two strains of LASV in these animals, to shed light on the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with the different outcomes. 
 The clinical signs observed in these animals after AV and Josiah Lassa virus infection, as well as the survival curves, have been previously described and are not presented here [25]. Histopathological features of AV and Josiah infection have also been previously reported for these animals thanks to hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue sections [25]. Two days post infection ( DPI ), a few infected cells were detected by in situ hybridization ( ISH ) in the subcortical sinus of the inguinal lymph nodes ( ILN ) draining the injection site in both AV- ( Fig 1A ) and Josiah- ( Fig 1B ) infected cynomolgus monkeys. A massive infection of the ILN and MLN paracortex was detected 5 DPI in both groups of LASV-infected animals. At this time point, only a few infection foci were detected in the splenic red pulp of Josiah-infected animals, and to a lesser extent, in that of AV-infected animals ( S1 Fig ). By 11 DPI, Josiah and AV LASV had spread beyond the previously infected areas to reach the germinal centers of the LN and splenic white pulp. During in the recovery of AV-infected animals ( 28 DPI ), residual viral RNA was detected in the germinal centers and white pulp. Multiplex immunostaining was performed to identify the LASV-infected cells. In the MLN of AV-infected animals, LASV GPC was detected mostly in CD68+ cells ( monocytes or macrophages ) at 5 and 11 DPI ( Fig 1C ). A massive infiltration of neutrophils ( calprotectin+ cells ) was observed at 5 DPI in the MLN of Josiah-infected animals, and LASV antigen colocalized mostly with CD68+ calprotectin+ cells and desmin+ cells, corresponding to stromal cells, and, to a lesser extent, CD68+ cells, at 5 and 11 DPI. In the spleens of AV- and Josiah-infected animals at 5 and 11 DPI, LASV GPC was detected in CD68+, calprotectin+, and desmin+ cells, and neutrophil infiltration was observed ( Fig 1D ). T lymphocytes ( CD3+ cells ) were often found close to infected cells in the spleens of AV-infected animals. In the livers of AV-infected animals, viral RNA was detected only in immune cell infiltrates and in sinuses and not until 11 DPI ( S1 Fig ). In Josiah-infected animals, viral RNA was detected as early as 5 DPI, and a massive infection with immune cell infiltrates, affecting Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, was observed at 11 DPI. AV LASV RNA was not detectable at any time point in the kidneys, lungs, cerebellum, and heart. Only a few AV LASV RNA-positive cells were detected in the brain, always within capillaries. By contrast, large amounts of Josiah LASV RNA were detected in kidney endothelial cells at 11 DPI. In the lungs of Josiah-infected animals, viral RNA was present in mononuclear cells from 5 DPI onwards, extending to epithelial cells by 11 DPI. In Josiah-infected animals, a massive infection of the endothelial cells of the brain and cerebellum was observed ( S2 Fig ). A few infected cells were detected in the heart in Josiah-infected animals. The adrenal glands were a preferential site of Josiah LASV replication, with numerous clusters of infected cells detected at 5 and 11 DPI ( S Fig 3 ). In AV-infected animals, a few infected cells were detected at 5 DPI, but none at 11. The adrenal glands of Jos-infected animals showed a massive infection at 5 and 11 DPI ( S Fig 3 ). Infection was also detected in the pancreas of Jos-infected animals at 5 and 11 DPI ( S Fig 4 ). In AV-inf animals, a few infected cells were detected at 5 DPI, but none at 11. The pancreas of Jos-infected showed massive infection at 5 and 11 DPI ( S Fig 4 ). Infection was detected in the thyroid of Jos-infected at 5 and 11 DPI ( S Fig 5 ). AV-inf animals showed a few infected cells at 5 DPI, none at 11. The thyroid of Jos-inf showed massive infection at 5 and 11 ( S Fig 5 ) Infection was detected in the testes of Jos-inf at 5 and 11 ( S Fig 6 ) AV-inf animals showed few cells at 5 DPI, none 11. The testes of Jos-inf showed massive at 5 and 11 ( Fig 6 ) Infection was detected in the ovaries of Jos-inf at 5 and 11 ( S Fig 7 ) AV-inf showed few at 5 DPI, none 11. The ovaries of Jos showed massive at 5 and 11 ( Fig 7 ) Infection was detected in the bone marrow of Jos-inf at 5 and 11 ( S Fig 8 ) AV-inf showed few at 5, none 11. The bone marrow of Jos showed at 5 and 11 ( Fig 8 ) Infection was detected in the muscle of Jos at 5 and 11 ( S 9 ) AV-inf showed few at 5, none. The muscle of Jos showed at 5 and 11 ( 9 ) Infection was detected in the skin of Jos at 5 and 11 ( S 10 ) AV showed few at 5, none. The skin of Jos showed at 5 and 11 ( 10 ) Infection was detected in the eye of Jos at 5 and 11 ( S 11 ) AV showed few 5, none. The eye of Jos showed at 5 and 11 ( 11 ) Infection was detected in the tongue of Jos at 5 and 11 ( S 12 ) AV showed few 5, none. The tongue of Jos showed at 5 and 11 ( 12 ) Infection was detected in the nose of Jos at 5 and 11 ( 13 ) AV showed few 5, none. The nose of Jos showed 5 and 11 ( 13 ) Infection was detected in the ear of Jos at 5 and 11 ( 14 ) AV showed few 5, none. The ear of Jos showed 5 and 11 ( 14 ) Infection was detected in the mouth of Jos at 5 and 11 ( 15 ) AV showed few 5, none. The mouth of Jos showed 5 and 11 (15 ) Infection was detected in the pharynx of Jos at 5 and 11 ( 16 ) AV showed few 5, none. The pharynx of Jos showed 5 and 11 (16 ) Infection was detected in the larynx of Jos at 5 and 11 (17 ) AV showed 5, none. The lary of Jos showed 5 and 11 (17 ) Infection was detected in the trachea of Jos 5 and 11 (18 ) AV showed 5, none. The trache of showed 5 and 11 (18 ) Infection was detected in the bronchi of Jos 5 and

    Title: 
    Article: Pathological disruption of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport ( NCT ), such as the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins ( Nups ), nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ). However, the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause, or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear, and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown. Here, we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset. First, taking advantage of two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block. Second, we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran. These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations. Third, we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration. Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import. These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function. 
 Nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) defects underlie several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) [1–3]. Here we show that mutations in Nuclear Export Mediator Factor ( NEMF ) in mice result in Importin-β-specific nuclear import defects, cytoplasmic protein mis-localization, and recapitulate phenotypic and transcriptional alterations found in neurodegenerative disorders. We further show that transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative diseases. NCT involves the regulated trafficking of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) [4]. Smaller molecules ( <40kDa ) can freely migrate through the nuclear pore, whereas larger molecules require active transport mediated by nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs, also known as karyopherins ) such as importins and exportins [5]. During nuclear import, nuclear import receptors ( NIRs ), such as Importin-β, directly bind their cargo in the cytoplasm or utilize importin-α as an adaptor to bind cargo proteins bearing a classical nuclear localization signal ( cNLS ) [6, 7]. Other NIRs, such as Transportin-1, recognize different nuclear localization signals, such as a Proline-Tyrosine NLS ( PY-NLS ), for transport into the nucleus [8]. Pathological disruption of NCT, such as the mis-localization of Nuclear Pore Complex proteins ( Nups ), NTRs, and Ran-GTPase, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of ALS, FTD, and AD/ADRD [9–16]. In addition, pathological cytoplasmic protein aggregates mark the progression of most neurodegenerative diseases [17, 18]. One of the most frequently found protein aggregates comprises TAR-DNA binding protein-43 ( TDP-43 ), normally a nuclear protein that, in disease, mis-localizes and aggregates in the cytoplasm [19]. Cytoplasmic aggregation and loss of nuclear TDP-43 are observed in post-mortem neurons and glia in 97% of cases in ALS, 40% of cases in FTD, and in many cases of AD/ADRD [20]. Amino acid substitutions in NEMF have been identified in multiple human patients exhibiting severe neurodevelopmental disorders [21–23]. However, the mechanisms through which these NEMF variants result in disease are unknown. While NEMF was initially associated with nuclear transport in Drosophila ( Caliban ) [24], its canonical role has more recently been elucidated in the context of ribosome quality control ( RQC ). The RQC is recruited to stalled translation events [25–29], where NEMF plays a crucial role in targeting partially translated nascent chain polypeptides ( NCPs ) on the 60S ribosome for proteasomal degradation [24, 28, 30–33]. NEMF’s interaction with the 60S ribosome facilitates the recruitment and stabilization of the E3 ubiquitin Ligase Listerin ( LTN1 ), promoting the ubiquitination of NCPs [26, 28, 30, 31, 34, 35]. Additionally, NEMF can generate c-terminal alanine ( and threonine ) tails on NCPs ( CATylation ) to expose amino acids in the ribosomal exit tunnel for subsequent ubiquitination by LTN1 [34, 36, 37]. These stalled translational events are most commonly a result of premature polyadenylation, where a poly ( A ) tail is inserted into the open reading frame resulting in the translation of lysine-AAA codons [26, 28, 29, 38–40]. Notably, these so-called “nonstop” lysine-rich polypeptides that escape degradation by the RQC, as well as other defective ribosomal products ( DRiPs ), will be transported into the nucleus and will accumulate into the nucleolus before degradation [25, 41]. Furthermore, Importin-β has been demonstrated to bind to translating NCPs targeted to the nucleus, suggesting that protein quality control and nuclear import mechanisms are more directly interconnected [42]. Mutations in both Listerin and Nemf in mice have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases [21, 43]. Previously, Martin et al. [21] described two mouse models with different N-ethyl N-nitrosourea ( ENU ) -induced missense mutations in Nemf which develop progressive motor neuron degeneration. These two mouse lines carrying homozygous mutations in NemfR86S/R86S and NemfR487G/R487G, henceforth NemfR86S and NemfR487G, show progressive neuromuscular degeneration correlated with progressive loss of neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) occupancy and axonal degeneration, with the NemfR86S mice showing a more early-onset and severe phenotype. However, the exact nature of how these singe nucleotide polymorphisms result in a motor neuron disease and neurodegeneration remains unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that the mutant mouse model, NemfR86S, exhibits impaired nuclear import of proteins containing canonical nuclear localization signals ( cNLS ), consequently leading to defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport both in vitro and in vivo. We have identified a specific defect in Importin-β mediated transport that manifests as both nuclear loss and cytoplasmic gain of NEMF, Importin-β, and TDP-43, along with a collapse of the Ran gradient. This dysregulation is further associated with the altered expression of transcripts associated with neurodegeneration, specifically Stmn2. Remarkably, the downregulation of Stmn2 observed in our Nemf mutant-mouse model can be reproduced through the transient induction of a nuclear import block in both murine and human cells using a small molecular antagonist of Importin-β, importazole. Our study reveals that there is a causative role for an Importin-β nuclear import deficiency upstream of the multiple proteinopathies and transcriptional pathologies found in neurodegenerative disease. 
 To investigate the mechanism by which the missense Nemf mutation in mice led to an age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotype associated with motor deficits [21], we immunostained transverse lumbar spinal cords of wild type and NemfR86S homozygous mutant mice at 21 days ( NemfR86S median lifespan: 20 days ) [21]. Lumbar spinal motor neurons were identified by ChAT-positive cells located in the ventral horn. In wild type ( WT ) mice, NEMF was found to be predominantly nuclear with diffuse cytoplasmic staining ( Fig 1A and 1B ). NemfR86S mice exhibited nuclear loss of NEMF with a significant cytoplasmic accumulation ( Fig 1C and 1 ). Immunostaining for Import-β and T-43 showed that Import-β was cytoplasmic in NemR86 mice ( Fig 1 and 1 ) while T-43 accumulated in the cytoplasm of both WT and NemR mice ( Fig 1 and 1. Immunostaining for RanGTP and RanG1 showed that RanGTP was cytoplasmic in NemR mice ( Fig 1 and 1 ) while RanG1 was cytoplasm in both WT and Nem mice ( Fig 1 and 1. Immunostaining for St2 showed that St2 was cytoplasm in NemR mice ( Fig 1 and 1 while St was nuclear in WT mice ( Fig 1 and 1. Immunostaining for Import-β showed that Import- was cytoplasm in NemR mice ( Fig 1 and 1 while Import was nuclear in WT ( Fig 1 and 1.

    Title: 
    Article: Lytic bacteriophages hold substantial promise in medical and biotechnological applications. Therefore a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is crucial. CRISPR-Cas systems offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagenesis efficiency. Our study utilizes the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Furthermore, by temporally removing DNA modifications, we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants. 
 Bacteriophages ( phages ) are viruses that specifically infect prokaryotic hosts. The high potential of the application of lytic phages in both medical and industrial settings has boosted phage research in recent years [1–4]. However, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie efficient phage infections, which is essential for their targeted utilization, remains significantly underexplored. This knowledge gap is evident even in extensively studied phages like the Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4 ( phage T4 ). Approximately half of the 273 encoded proteins in phage T4 are associated with known functions, while the roles of the other proteins remain unclear [5]. To explore the biological functions of phage-derived proteins, gene deletion has been the primary method historically employed, providing critical insights into gene essentiality for the phage infection process [6, 7]. However, mutagenesis targeting only the catalytic residues rather than deleting the entire protein offers a possibility to elucidate the enzyme’s role within a specific molecular context. The generation of catalytically inactive proteins preserves the other potential functions of the studied protein, such as involvement in protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. Particularly in phages with complex genomes, like phage T4, which has numerous overlapping genes and gene splicing arrangements [7], targeted mutagenesis is crucial to avoid unintended effects on other genes’ expression. Prophages, whose genomes are integrated into the host chromosome and passively replicate alongside the host genome, can be mutated in vivo using the same genetic tools as for the mutagenesis of their host. However, this does not apply to lytic phages, as their genetic material exists separately from the host genome within bacterial cells and undergoes rapid replication during a limited time of infection. Therefore, targeted mutagenesis of lytic phages is highly challenging, as evidenced by the diverse strategies developed in recent years to approach it ( reviewed in Mahler et al. 2023 [8] ). Many developed approaches rely on recombination between phage DNA and a donor sequence, e. g., homologous recombination. This approach allows for gene replacements, deletions, or insertions. However, the efficiency of this method is low ( >0. 05% ), resulting in the requirement of extensive screening to identify phage mutants [9, 10]. To streamline the screening, incorporating reporter genes alongside the mutation to simplify the detection of the mutant phages has been employed [10, 11]. Yet, the insertion of reporter genes may affect the complex gene expression of the phage, like the implications of phage gene deletions as described above. Additionally, inserting an extra gene may affect the packaging of phage DNA into the capsid, which has a fixed size [10]. Another approach, building on homologous recombination principles, is the bacteriophage recombineering of electroporated DNA ( BRED ) method, which offers a relatively high mutagenesis rate ( 10–15% ) [12]. However, its effectiveness depends on the successful co-transformation of both phage DNA and donor DNA into the same cell, which might be limited by the host’s transformation efficiency or the phage genome size [13]. The discovery of the antiphage clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) and the CRISPR-associated protein ( Cas ) has revolutionized the field of genome editing. The successful application of targeted CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis across various organisms [14], has also raised the interest in its application for phage engineering. In this context, CRISPR-Cas can be employed to target a specific position within the phage genome during infection, generating a DNA double-strand break. This break can be further repaired via homologous recombination with donor DNA ( DNA carrying the desired mutation ) present within the infected cell. However, the application of the CRISPR-Cas-based phage mutagenesis on the model phages, such as phage T4, has revealed an overall low mutagenesis efficiency ( 0–3% ) and being strongly dependent on the spacer selected for the mutagenesis [15–17]. This strongly impedes the specific targeting of the phage genome via CRISPR-Cas and requires pre-screening for efficient spacer before the mutagenesis, strongly reducing the applicability of the approach for efficient phage mutagenesis. The reason for the strong spacer dependence of Cas targeting efficiency is attributed to the extensive DNA modifications—present on phage DNA—that protect it from cleavage. The DNA modifications among the phages are widely distributed and are also present in the phage T4 [18, 19]. The enzyme deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase ( gene 42 ) originating from T4 phage catalyzes the conversion of 2´-deoxycytidine 5´-monophosphate ( dCMP ) into 5-hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine 5´-monophosphate, which is subsequently converted to into 5-hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine 5’-triphosphate and incorporated into T4 DNA during replication ( further referred to as 5hmdC ). Next, the 5hmdC is glycosylated by α- or β-glycosyltransferases ( α-/β-gt ) to 5-α-/β-glycosyl hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine ( 5ghmdC ) within T4 DNA ( Fig 1A ) [20, 21]. The T4 phage epigenome plays a crucial role in phage fitness, exemplified by the essential gene 42. Notably, amber mutants for the gene have been reported. However, in this scenario, phage infections must be carried out using E. coli strains that harbor additional plasmids and thus do not represent the wild-type E. coli. Furthermore, α-/β-gt serve as auxiliary genes [7, 17, 22], as the encoded proteins are pivotal in protecting phage DNA through glycosylation from host defense systems and host nucleases, including Cas nucleases [15, 23]. Thus, DNA modifications such as 5hmdC and 5ghmdC prevent the effective use of CRISPR-Cas for targeted phage mutagenesis and counterselection. In this study, we apply a eukaryotic ten-eleven translocation ( TET ) methylcytosine dioxygenase [24] to temporally reduce the abundance of 5ghmdC within the phage T4 genome to enable the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas. This results in the facilitated introduction of point mutations into the phage genome in a scarless manner, exemplarily shown for two specific T4 phage ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. The increased targeting efficiency of phage DNA by Cas nucleases allows for sequence-specific spacer selection. Simultaneously, the improved targeting efficiency of phage DNA by Cas nucleases can be exploited for efficient counterselection, streamlining the enrichment process for the generated phage mutant. We utilized a high-throughput screening approach based on next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) to identify the mutants, facilitating the identification and validation of phage T4 mutants. This method is compatible with automation, simplifying the phage genome engineering process and eliminating the need to introduce reporter genes into the phage genome. The scarless nature of this approach allows for the precise study of the impact of introduced mutations on phage infection without the side effects associated with gene deletion or reporter gene insertion. Overall, our findings propose an efficient strategy for introducing point mutations into genomes of lytic phages that possess cytosine-based DNA modifications. These advantages collectively position this technique as a valuable tool in synthetic biology and biotechnology for creating "designer phages" as well as in fundamental research to explore the mechanisms underlying phage infections. Moreover, this technique offers the opportunity to study the influence of phage epigenome on phage infection dynamics without necessitating the deletion of the essential phage DNA modifying genes. 
 The gene encoding for the NgTET from Naegleria crassa was cloned into a plasmid and expressed in E. coli. The plasmid was then transformed into E. coli harboring phage T4, and the phage was isolated and purified. The purified phage was then treated with NgET to reduce 5md and 5ghC. The phage was then infected into E. coli and subjected to CRIS-Cas-mediated mutagenesis using a guide RNA targeting the ADP-ribosyltransferase gene. The phage was isolated and sequenced using NGS to identify the mutants. The results showed a high mutagen efficiency of the phage with mutations in the AD-ribosyltransferase gene. The same approach was repeated for the second AD-ribosyltransferase gene. The results showed a high mutagen efficiency of the ph with mutations in the second AD-ribyltransferase gene. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of NgET in reducing 5md and 5C enabling efficient targeting of phage with CR-Cas. The results also show the potential of this approach for introducing point mutations into the ph genome without the need for reporter genes or gene deletions. The study highlights the importance of the ph epigenome in ph infection and the role of 5md and 5C in protecting ph from CR-C mediated mutagenesis. The results suggest that the use of NgET to reduce 5md and 5C can be a valuable tool for ph engineering phages with cytosine modifications. The study also demonstrates the potential of high-throughput screening using NGS to identify and validate ph mutants. The approach is compatible with automation and does not require the introduction of reporter genes into the ph genome. The scarless nature of the approach allows the study of the impact of mutations on ph infection without side effects associated with gene deletions or insertions. The results position this technique as a valuable tool in synthetic biology and biotechnology for creating "design phages" as well as fundamental research to explore mechanisms phage infections.

    Title: 
    Article: The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. A manifold of mechanisms act in concert to ensure adequate DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide, act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and thus represent a major threat to cell metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of active genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ), a yet incompletely understood NER sub-pathway. Here, using a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified histone variant H2A. Z as an important component to safeguard transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2A. Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, H2A. Z is needed for proficient TC-NER and plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. 
 Living cells continuously suffer DNA damage that may lead to mutations and genomic instability if left unrepaired. DNA damage may occur by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet ( UV ) light or chemicals or by endogenous factors derived from the cell metabolism. DNA damage generates structural distortions that interfere with basic cellular functions like transcription and replication. Cells possess a number of pathways to keep DNA lesions, transcription and replication stress under control, many of which are highly conserved throughout evolution. Among the repair pathways, nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) is a versatile repair pathway capable of removing a large variety of structurally unrelated lesions such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( CPDs ) and pyrimidone 6–4 photoproducts, X-ray induced cyclopurines or adducts induced by chemicals such as 4-nitroquinoline oxide ( 4-NQO ), benzo[a]pyrene, N-acetoxy-2-actylaminofluorene, psoralens, etc. These bulky lesions, which lead to RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) stalling when located on the template strand, can affect gene expression and may have severe consequences for cell function [1]. Furthermore, trapped RNAPs represent an impediment for the replication machinery and can lead to transcription-replication conflicts ( TRCs ), a primary source of genome instability [2, 3]. Hence, bulky DNA lesions exhibit strong mutagenic and thus tumorigenic potential, as exemplified by skin cancer, which is primarily caused by exposure to natural UV light [4]. Transcription-blocking lesions are mainly repaired by transcription-coupled NER ( TC-NER ), which differs from global genome NER ( GG-NER ) in the lesion recognition step, while the core repair reaction is common to both sub-pathways. In TC-NER, stalling of the elongating RNAP at the DNA damage promptly triggers the repair reaction on the transcribed strand ( TS ) of active genes while in GG-NER, a specialized DNA damage recognition complex–which consists of Rad7, Rad16 and Elc1 in budding yeast–improves the detection of the helix-distorting DNA lesions throughout the genome. In eukaryotes, the human Cockayne’s syndrome protein B ( CSB ) and its yeast homolog Rad26 are among the first proteins to act at DNA damage-stalled RNAPII and contribute to the recruitment of further repair factors [5, 6]. Residual TC-NER activity persists in the absence of Rad26 in yeast and has been shown to depend largely on Rpb9, a nonessential subunit of RNAPII [7]. A handful of factors involved in different aspects of transcription, including elongation, formation of export-competent mRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes and termination are required for TC-NER proficiency [8–10]. Recent works have shown that the Elf1/ELOF1 transcription elongation factor functions in TC-NER both in yeast and human cells, where it promotes the recruitment and assembly of further repair factors [11–13]. Interestingly, these studies also revealed a role for ELOF1 in preventing transcription-replication conflicts upon treatment with genotoxic agents. Despite the advances that have been made in our understanding of TC-NER, the actions taking place at a stalled RNAPII during TC-NER and the crosstalk with other nuclear events remain elusive [1, 6]. With the aim at identifying new TC-NER factors to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of this repair pathway, we screened the non-essential deletion strain collection from S. cerevisiae for mutations leading to increased sensitivity to 4-NQO. This genetic screen was performed in strains lacking the RAD7 GG-NER gene as a way to enhance the sensitivity of the assay and enrich in new functions involved in TC-NER. We identified HTZ1, which encodes the yeast H2A. Z histone variant, as a gene required for efficient TC-NER and RNAPII clearance following UV irradiation. Importantly, UV-irradiation of H2A. Z-depleted cells leads to an accumulation of double-strand breaks ( DSBs ), which constitute a major threat to genome stability. 
 With the aim at identifying factors with a yet undescribed role in TC-NER, we undertook a genome-wide screen for deletion mutants showing increased sensitivity to the UV-mimetic drug 4-NQO in a GG-NER defective strain background. Therefore, a yeast collection of 5140 viable knock-out strains [14] was crossed with a strain bearing a deletion of the RAD7 repair gene and the growth of the resulting double mutants in control and 4-NQO containing plates assessed by visual inspection ( Fig 1A ). 820 mutants with apparent growth impairment when combined with rad7Δ were retrieved and screened a second time using the same conditions, leading to the identification of 44 candidate strains with putative roles in TC-NER ( S1 Table ). A selection of 31 strains were then assayed by manual cross with rad7Δ, tetrad dissection and analysis of UV and 4-NQO sensitivities, resulting in 19 candidates with confirmed phenotypes ( Figs 1B and S1 and S1 Table ). Among the identified genes, several have known function in DNA recombination, post-replicative repair, and DNA damage checkpoint, while others encode proteins without known implication in DNA repair-related processes. Next, we assessed the sensitivity of the corresponding single mutant strains to other genotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea ( HU ), camptothecin, caffein and methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) to gain insights into the possible functions of their gene product in different pathways ( S1 Fig ). Because DNA damage generated by the alkylating agent MMS is repaired by mechanisms other than NER, the 8 candidates that were not sensitive to MMS ( mph1Δ, hir1Δ, htz1Δ, clb5Δ, doc1Δ, fes1Δ, gim5Δ, and qri7Δ ) were selected for further analyses. The MMS sensitive nup84Δ strain, which was recently reported to be deficient both in TC- and GG-NER [15], was also included as NER-deficient control. The repair efficiency of UV-induced CPDs on the TS and non-transcribed strand ( NTS ) of the constitutively expressed RPB2 gene were assessed ( S2 Fig ). A strain in which the RPB9 gene is deleted was used as control, as this transcription factor is known to be required for efficient TC-NER [7]. All mutants showed repair efficiencies that were comparable to the wild-type strain, except NER-deficient nup84Δ and htz1Δ, for which repair on the TS was as low as for rpb9Δ. The HTZ1 gene encodes the yeast histone variant H2A. Z ( also called Htz1 ), which has been implicated in numerous processes including DSB repair by homologous recombination ( HR ), replicative stress induced DSB formation and GG-NER in H2A. Z-bearing nucleosomes of an inactive promoter [16–20], but so far not in TC-NER. Because of the ubiquitous role of H2A. Z in DNA-templated processes, we generated double mutants lacking the HR factor Rad52, the post-replicative repair factor Rad18, or the endonuclease Rad1, which is strictly required for both NER sub-pathways, TC-NER and GG-NER. Sensitivity to 4-NQO and UV were assessed in these strains and in the corresponding double mutants lacking Rpb9, with the aim at evaluating possible overlap among repair pathways ( Fig 1C ). Deletion of HTZ1 led to increased 4-NQO/UV sensitivity in cells deficient in HR, post-replicative repair, and NER, consistent with a role for H2A. Z in more than one single repair pathway. Noteworthy, similar results were obtained in cells deleted for Rpb9, suggesting that both gene products may have shared functions. However, no combination of these mutants could be assessed as htz1Δ and rpb9Δ are synthetic lethal [21] ( Fig 1C ). To further investigate the role of H2. in TCER, we analyzed the repair of UV-induced CPDs on the TS of the RPB gene in ht1 and r9 double mutants ( S Fig 2 ). In contrast to the single mutants, ht1 and r9, the ht1r9 double mutant showed reduced repair on the TS, indicating that H2. is required for TCER in the absence of R9. These results suggest that H2. and R9 act in the same TCER pathway and that H2. is necessary for proficient TCER when R9 is absent. We conclude that H2. is required for TCER and plays a role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. 
The article discusses the role of histone H2 Z in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TCER ) pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study used a genetic screen to identify H2 as an important component of TCER and showed that its absence leads to impaired repair and increased double-strand breaks. The results suggest that H2 is necessary for proficient TCER and plays a role in maintaining genome stability upon UV irradiation. The study also found that H2 and R9 act in the same TC pathway and that H is necessary for TC when R9 is absent. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of TCER and highlight the importance of H2 in maintaining genome stability.

    Title: 
    Article: The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known. This gene expression variation is context dependent, with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors, and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect. So far, little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence. To address this question, we analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the derived, European range and one from the ancestral, African range. In both the transcriptome and microbiome data, we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects, including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects, although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele specific expression revealed that, while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture, this observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution. 
 Gene expression variation is extensive at all organismal levels, including among tissues [1–2], cells [3–4], or alleles [5–6] of the same individual, and underlies much of the phenotypic variation that we see among individuals, populations, and species [7–9]. A long-standing challenge in evolutionary genetics has been to identify and characterize this variation. Indeed, elucidating the scope and architecture of gene expression variation as well as the mechanisms that shape it is an integral part of better understanding complex phenotypic traits [10–12], such as body size or disease susceptibility, and their evolution. At the DNA sequence level, genetically heritable variants can modulate expression in two general ways: cis-regulatory variants, such as those within enhancers or promoters, affect the expression of linked, nearby genes, while trans-regulatory variants, such as those affecting transcription factors or regulatory RNAs, affect the expression of unlinked genes that can be located anywhere in the genome ( reviewed in [13–14] ). One way to interrogate the relative contribution of these types of regulatory variants to gene expression variation in species such as Drosophila, where inbred, relatively isogenic strains are available, is to compare gene expression of two parental strains or species as well as expression of their alleles in F1 hybrids [15]. Due to linkage with the allele they regulate, cis-regulatory variants affect only one of the two F1 hybrid alleles, leading to allele-specific expression ( ASE ), while trans-regulatory variants equally affect both alleles in the hybrid and do not lead to ASE. While cis-regulatory variation is thought to accumulate and become more predominant over larger evolutionary distances, i. e. between species [16–18], trans-regulatory variation tends to be more common among individuals within a species [5–6, 19]. However, deviations from this pattern of regulatory variation have been documented in Drosophila [20–23] as well as other species [24–25], which underscores that there remains much to learn about the evolution of gene expression regulation, especially over short evolutionary distances. An advantage of utilizing ASE to investigate the regulation of gene expression is that both the genetic basis of expression variation ( e. g. cis versus trans ) and the mode of expression inheritance ( e. g., dominance versus additivity ) can be assessed. Indeed, previous studies of ASE in Drosophila utilizing expression in F1 hybrids have found that environment [6, 26], sex [27–28], genetic background [19, 21, 28], and body part or tissue [21–22, 28] can affect regulatory architecture. However, previous studies have largely focused on single populations, long term lab strains, or comparatively closely related populations [5–6, 20–22, 26–28] ( for an exception see [19] ). Moreover, previous studies measured expression in whole animals, body parts ( e. g. heads ), single tissues, and/or highly functionally diverged tissues ( i. e. testes versus ovaries or heads ) ; thus, little is known about how regulatory architecture and inheritance vary among individual tissues that are spatially and/or functionally proximate. To investigate the effect of natural genetic variation from divergent populations on regulatory architecture in multiple functionally related, interconnected tissues, we analyzed messenger RNA-sequencing ( mRNA-seq ) data of midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule tissues in four D. melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids. Two of the strains were from a population in Umeå, Sweden [29], representing the northern edge of the species’ derived distribution, while the other two strains were from a population in Siavonga, Zambia, representing the species’ inferred ancestral range [30]. Since their divergence from ancestral populations ~12, 000 years ago [31], derived D. melanogaster populations have had to adapt to new habitats, and previous studies have found evidence that at least some of the expression divergence detected between derived and ancestral African populations is adaptive [32–36]. The midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules, which are analogous to the mammalian small and large intestines and kidneys, respectively, physically connect to and interact with one another at the midgut-hindgut junction and are part of the D. melanogaster digestive tract ( midgut and hindgut, together with the foregut ) and excretory system ( hindgut and Malpighian tubules ). Both systems play important roles in the regulation of homeostasis as well as the immune response [37–38] and the investigated tissues are known to engage in interorgan communication with each other, as well as with other tissues [37–39]. The excretory system is involved in waste excretion as well as ionic- and osmoregulation [38], while the digestive tract is an important modulator of food intake, nutrient absorption, energy homeostasis, and insulin secretion that can shape physiology and behavior through its interaction with the microbiome [37, 40]. To investigate the effect of natural genetic variation from divergent populations on digestive tract microbiome composition, we further performed microbiome sequencing on the same gut samples for which we performed mRNA-seq. In both the mRNA-seq and microbiome data, we found extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects. From the ASE data, we found that genes with both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific than genes with no differential expression regulation, although trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. Despite the context specificity that we detected for regulatory architecture across tissues and genetic backgrounds, the increased specificity of trans effects was consistent, suggesting that trans-regulatory variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or, potentially, better than cis-regulatory variation. 
 We detected 116–2, 589 ( mean 961–1, 398 ) genes as differentially expressed between genotypes within each tissue ( Fig 2A ). However, gene expression divergence ( i. e. the cumulative differences in expression across all analyzed genes, as measured by 1 –Spearman’s rho, ρ ) between genotypes within each tissue was not significantly different among tissues ( t-test; Bonferroni-corrected P > 0. 8 for all; S1A Fig ). Expression divergence tended to be lower between strains derived from the same population ( i. e. Swedish strains were more similar to each other than to the Zambian strains and vice versa ), although in the hindgut and Malpighian tubule, SU58 was equally or more similar to one or both Zambian strains than to the SU26 strain ( Fig 2A ). This pattern was not evident in the Malpighian tubule when all genes that could be analyzed in this tissue were included in the analysis ( S2 Fig ). When we compared expression within the same genotype among tissues, we detected 4, 524–5, 139 ( mean 4, 844 ) genes as differentially expressed between any two tissues ( Fig 2B ), 50–58% of which were differentially expressed in all pairwise tissue comparisons within a genotype and 1, 619–1, 880 of which were shared among at least two genotypes, with 1, 045 genes differentially expressed among all tissues within all genotypes ( S1 Table ). Of these shared differentially expressed genes, 1, 243–1, 594 were consistently upregulated in the same tissue within the same genotype, with 700–924 genes consistently upregulated in the same tissue in all genotypes ( S1 Table ). Interestingly, overall gene expression divergence within the same genotype between the midgut and Malpighian tubule was significantly lower than gene expression divergence between either the midutg and hindut or hindut Maligh tub ( t-test Bonerr-corrected P < 0. 01 for both; Fig 2B ), indicating that these two tissues are more similar to each other than the hindut and Maligh tub. This pattern was not evident when all genes could be analyzed in the Maligh tub ( S Fig 2 ). In the hindut and Maligh tub, we detected 1,–2, 1 1 ( mean 1, 1 ) genes as differentially expressed between genotypes ( Fig 2 ), which was significantly lower than in the midut and Maligh tub ( t-test Bonerr-correct P < 0 0. 01; Fig 2 ), indicating that these two tissues are more similar to each other than the midut and Maligh. This pattern was not evident in the Maligh tub when all genes could be analyzed in this tissue ( S Fig 2 ). In the hindut and Maligh, we detected 1,–, 1 ( mean 1, ) genes as differentially expressed between genotypes ( Fig 2 ) which was significantly lower in the mid and Maligh ( t-test Bonerr-correct < 0. 01; Fig 2 ) indicating that these tissues are more similar to each other than the mid and Maligh. This pattern was not evident in the Maligh when all could be analyzed in this tissue ( S Fig 2 ). In the hind and Maligh, we detected 1,–, 1 ( mean 1 ) as differentially expressed between genotypes ( Fig 2 ) which was lower in the and Maligh ( t-test Bonerr-correct < 0.01; Fig 2 ) indicating these tissues are more similar each other than the Maligh. This was not evident in Maligh when all could be in this tissue ( Fig 2 ) In the hind and Mal, we detected 1–, 1 ( mean 1 ) as different expressed between genotypes ( Fig 2 which was lower in Mal (testerr-correct < 0.01; Fig 2 ) indicating these are more each other than Mal. This was not in Mal when could be in ( Fig 2 ) In the and Mal, we detected 1–1 ( mean 1 as different between genotypes Fig 2 which was lower (test-correct < 0 01; Fig 2 indicating these more each other.

    Title: 
    Article: While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown, information on early cases can be used to date it. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e. g., first human SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data. Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case. Here, we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case. We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data. We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK, dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21, 2020 ( 95% interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ) : July 23–September 5, 2020 ). Next, we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020. We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28, 2019 ( 95% IPR: November 2–December 9, 2019 ). Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data. Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible, and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19. 
 Dating the first infection of an emerging infectious disease is a step towards tracing the disease’s origin and understanding early epidemic dynamics. Beyond the early transmission of a new pathogen, estimating the date of first infection is also of interest while studying the initiations of local clusters in naïve populations, such as when the pathogen is first introduced to a new location, but also when the pathogen evolves to distinct genotypes such as emerging variants of concern ( VOCs ). Various attempts have been made to date the first human infections by SARS-CoV-2 that led to the COVID-19 pandemic ( noting that earlier spillovers, leading to dead-ends, may have occurred ), using case data and/or viral genomic data. Using a stochastic model for the epidemic spread coupled with genomic data allowing to trace transmission at the individual level, Pekar et al. [1] estimated that the first human infection took place between late October and early December 2019. This estimate was slightly later than a previous one by the same authors, who had previously found an emergence date between mid-October and mid-November 2019 [2]. Their revision notably included updating the dates of the first case reported [3], and better cleaning up genomic data to exclude sequencing errors [1]. Another, earlier, modeling study used case data only and dated the first COVID-19 case between early October and mid-November 2019, by adapting a technique used in conservation science for dating extinction using observation events [4]. The analysis had nevertheless been conducted on outdated case data [5]; re-running the analysis on updated case data had major effects on both the estimated date of the first infection and 95% confidence interval ( see Fig A in S1 Text ). Other studies have focused on the introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to different countries. Some have used molecular clock analyses relying on genomic data to determine the time of most recent common ancestor ( tMRCA; providing an upper bound for the time of the first infection, see Fig 1 ) of lineages introduced in a focal country. For instance, studies have been conducted using genomic data from France [6], the United States [7] and the United Kingdom ( UK ) [8]. Another study, based on case data only, used a stochastic non-Markovian approach relying on mortality data to estimate the date of SARS-CoV-2 introduction to France [9]; the first COVID-19 wave was estimated to have been initiated mid-January 2020 in France. Finally, similar frameworks have been used to date the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. One study focusing on the emergence of the ‘EU1’ SARS-CoV-2 variant ( B. 1. 177 ) circulating among European countries during the summer of 2020 used genomic data and dated most introductions to June, 2020 [10]. Dating attempts have also been done for the ‘Alpha’ variant ( B. 1. 1. 7 ), whose date of emergence was estimated at early August 2020 using a stochastic, non-Markovian approach relying on the date of the first observed case [11], and whose tMRCA was estimated at late August 2020 [12]. Genomic analyses on their own are usually insufficient to estimate the time of the first infections: the tMRCA does not necessarily approximate the emergence date [13], which can have taken place earlier ( see Fig 1 ). Infection times occurring earlier than the tMRCA may be estimated thanks to other mathematical models using population dynamics methodologies. Moreover, modeling studies have helped unveiling other unobserved indicators during the early stages of epidemics, such as the epidemic size at the time of first detection [11] or at the time of the first reported death [14]. In particular, because infection numbers are low, stochastic approaches are key to studying early dynamics and their long-term effects on the epidemic outbreak [15–19]. Hence, methodological developments of stochastic models to study the early stages of infectious diseases remain of great interest in the field of mathematical epidemiology; e. g. [20]. Finally, we think that there is value in approaching an inference question via different methods ( especially on potentially contentious topics ), in order to obtain methodologically independent confirmations of key estimates. The main objective of our study is the estimation of the date of the first infection leading to a sustained epidemic ( hereafter referred to as the date of epidemic/outbreak emergence ), using available data on the first N detected and reported cases. To this end, we build a stochastic model and design a simulation framework extending our previous work that only used information on the first detected case [11]. Our rationale for extending the analysis to more cases is two-fold. First and foremost, including more cases can make the analysis more robust to changes in the underlying case data. Second, a new methodology using more than just the first case will also give access to important information such as the proportion of detected cases among infections. Our simulations construct a transmission tree, and identify detected cases among the infections. The comparison of simulation outputs and available case data then allow the estimation of the date of emergence of the outbreak, as well as other key epidemiological pieces of information such as the proportion of the epidemic that remains undetected. We apply the framework to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in 2020 in the UK, and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019. 
 Moving on to real case data, we first ran our model to estimate the date of emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK, which was the main result of the numerical applications presented in [11]. We applied our model to a dataset of N = 406 samples carrying the Alpha variant collected and sequenced between September 20 and November 11, 2020 [21] ( cf. Fig D in S1 Text ). Table 2 summarizes the parameter values used in our simulations. The 5 000 simulated epidemics that we analyse below result from model calibration ( i. e., epidemics arising from a single infectious individual and verifying the calibration constraints; details in the Methods section ), and represent ∼36% of all simulations run with the input parameters. The cumulative cases of the accepted epidemics are depicted in Fig E in S1 Text. Hereafter, we summarize our results using median values and 95% interpercentile ranges ( 95%IPR; values between the 2. 5th and the 97. 5th percentiles ) from the distributions of the different epidemiological indicators obtained from the 5 000 simulated epidemics, similar to an approximation of the posterior distribution obtained in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework ( see Methods ). We also use the minimum values from those distributions to unveil the earliest infection occurrences among our simulated epidemics ( that is, the earliest dates possible for the first infection to occur ). We estimated the number of days between the 1st infection and the Nth case at 82 ( 95%IPR: 67–111 ), dating the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK at August 21 ( 95%IPR: July 23–September 5 ), 2020, and not earlier than June 13, 2020. Alpha transmissions were ongoing about 30 days ( 95%IPR: 10–60 ) before the date at which the first known case was sampled and sequenced. Table A in S1 Text provides other calibration metrics like the delay between the 1st and Nth sequenced samples in the simulations. Fig 2 depicts our estimates of the date of emergence along with the epidemic curve ( i. e., the daily number of sequenced samples; by sampling date ), for context, as well as previous estimates, for comparison. In particular, we ran an updated version of the model presented by Czuppon et al. in [11] ( the distribution of the number of secondary cases is negative-binomial instead of Poisson previously, and its mean, R, is now a function of the number of days since the first sequenced case ) to estimate the date of emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK. Our results are consistent with theirs, with a median of August 21 202 ( 95IPR: July 23–September 5, 202 ). Next, we apply our model to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in late 2019. We used a dataset of N = 96 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020 [22] ( cf. Fig D in S Text ) Table 3 summarizes the parameters used in simulations. The 5 000 simulated epidemics we analyse result from calibration ( i. e., epidemics arising a single individual verifying constraints details in the Methods ) and represent ∼% of all run with input. The cumulative cases of accepted epidemics are depicted in F in S Text. Here, we summarize results using median and 95 IPR values from the distributions of different epidemiological indicators from 5 000 simulated epidemics. We estimated the number of days between the 1 infection and Nth at 28 (95IP: 2–42 ), dating the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wu at November 28 (95IP: November 2–December 9 ), 2019, and earlier November 16 2019. transmissions were ongoing about days (95:– ) before the date the first case was reported. Table in S2 provides other calibration metrics like the delay between 1 and N sequenced in simulations. Fig 3 depicts our estimates of the date along the epidemic curve for Wuhan, as well as previous estimates for comparison. Our results fall within the ranges estimated by previous studies using genomic data [1, 2] and [4]. We also ran an updated version of the model by Pekar et al. [1] to estimate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in 2019. Our results are consistent with theirs, with a median of November 28 2019 (95IP: November 2–December 9, 201 ). 
Our study presents a population-based framework to estimate the date of the first infection leading to a sustained epidemic, using early reported cases. We validate our model on simulated data and apply it to the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK and the first SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Our results fall within previously estimated ranges using genomic data. The framework is generic and can be applied to estimate the starting of outbreaks in other contexts than COVID-19. 
The study of the first infection of an emerging disease is crucial for tracing the disease’s origin and early dynamics. Beyond the transmission of a new pathogen, estimating the date of first is also of interest in studying the initiations of local clusters in naïve populations, such as when the path is introduced to new, and when path evolves to genotypes such as VOCs.

    Title: 
    Article: During meiosis, pairing of homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division. Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination, dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing, as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Incorporating natural chromosome lengths, the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms. 
 Double stranded DNA has an uncanny ability to find a homologous partner in DNA mixtures of staggering complexity. While homologs in somatic cells tend to occupy nuclear areas more distant than expected, somatic pairing nevertheless underlies important biological processes, including X chromosome inactivation and association of loci affected by genomic imprinting [1, 2]. During meiosis, homolog pairing is a key prerequisite for the separation of homologs to opposite spindle poles. When pairing is compromised, homologs fail to form crossovers, resulting in homolog nondisjunction and the formation of gametes with a surplus or deficit of one or several chromosomes. The resulting chromosomal imbalances are a leading cause for birth defects and still births [3]. In many organisms, meiotic pairing depends on recombination initiation via double strand breaks ( DSBs ), enzymatically induced by the Spo11 transesterase [4]. DSBs typically occur at a multitude of chromosomal sites, at different positions in different cells. DSB processing is closely associated with the homology search, a process whereby DNA breaks carrying 3’ single-stranded overhangs assess homology between nearby chromosomes at the DNA sequence level [5]. If matched, DSBs are processed via homologous recombination into crossovers as well as other recombination products [6, 7]. Crossovers involve the reciprocal exchange of chromosome arms between homologs at allelic positions. In addition to providing physical linkage between homologs and ensuring their attachment to opposite spindle poles, crossovers also increase genetic diversity [6, 7]. The timing and genetic requirements of homolog pairing have been extensively studied in several organisms [6–10]. In budding yeast, homologs are somatically paired in G1-arrested cells, unpair during premeiotic DNA replication and commence re-pairing as cells initiate homologous recombination [10–13]. Around the time when homolog pairing is established, chromosomes also undergo rapid movements throughout prophase I, as a prerequisite for efficient pairing. Movements of chromosomes are mediated by motile cytoplasmic filaments, which drag chromosome ends ( telomeres ) through the semi-fluid nuclear envelope. Cytoplasmic motor proteins, actin in budding yeast and the dynein-microtubule complex in most other organisms, mediate nuclear chromosome movements due to the attachment of their ends via the conserved SUN-KASH protein complex where SUN proteins interact with chromosome ends and reach across the inner nuclear envelope whereas KASH proteins span the outer nuclear envelope providing a link between SUN proteins and the cytoplasmic filaments [14–17]. Pairing is completed around the time when both DSB ends have undergone strand exchange, giving rise to double Holliday junctions, a critical precursor of crossovers [10, 13]. The synaptonemal complex ( SC ) is a proteinaceous structure that assembles between paired homologs and juxtaposes their axes closely at 100 nm, a distance conserved in most taxa [6–10]. Homologous chromosomes are considered as paired once they have associated at a distance less than or equal to 400 nm, corresponding to the distance between co-aligned homolog axes in absence of the SC [8]. Little is known about the molecular mechanism ( s ) of homolog pairing, in part due to experimental challenges. Fixated, surface-spread cells exhibit superior resolution, but they do not provide insights about chromosome dynamics during the pairing process and nuclear architecture may become distorted during sample preparation [10, 13]. Tracking of chromosome trajectories in live cells is hampered by limited resolution and potential effects of phototoxicity [18]. Importantly, such studies are limited to a small subset of chromosomes due to the necessity to fluorescently label individual chromosomes [10, 13, 19]. Several mathematical models have examined potential contributions of molecular processes to homolog pairing, including telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, chromosome bending stiffness, and polymer chains exhibiting an excluded volume repulsive potential [18, 20–23]. Moreover, a cellular automaton model was developed that examines random searching via chromosome shuffling [24]. Importantly, existing pairing models cannot be validated as they model interactions between individual chromosomes that are presently inaccessible to experimental analysis. Here, we have developed an agent-based model ( ABM ), in which movements and interactions between individual chromosomes ( i. e. agents ) are simulated, thereby recapitulating the interaction dynamics of an entire nuclear chromosome ensemble. Rather than making assumptions about pairing dynamics along individual chromosomes, we use differential equations based on first principles that govern the movements of chromosomes as an outcome of interactions with all other chromosomes within the same nucleus. Our model allows for the analysis of individual trajectories for all chromosomes throughout meiotic prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of various chromosomal parameters, including chromosome number, size, and movement velocity as well as attractive and repulsive forces provide insights into the contributions of each of these factors to homolog pairing. 
 Our homologous pairing model considers three contributing processes, i. e., chromosome interactions ( homologous and non-homologous collision dynamics ), chromosome translation ( directed movements ), and random chromosome motion ( thermal noise within the nucleus ) ( Fig 1 ). By deriving a model entirely from these first principles, we avoid the introduction of mathematical parameters not apparent from the underlying biological process. A key feature of our model is the inclusion of attractive and repulsive forces representing processes that stabilize homologous pairing or disrupt non-homologous interactions, respectively. Rather than focusing on a single homolog pair, our model captures trajectories of complete chromosome ensembles throughout prophase of meiosis I, facilitating comparison with experimental data and adjustments to species-specific features such as chromosome number and size as well as nuclear dimensions. To compute the net motion of meiotic chromosome sets, we consider pairwise interactions between chromosomes at short distances as provided by a semi-dilute solution [25, 26]. A two-dimensional model is developed to match the available two-dimensional experimental measurements from fixated, surface-spread yeast nuclei used to calibrate the model [13]. For the dynamics of the center of mass, x i ∈ R 2, a coupled system of N equations can be proposed as x ˙ i = v 0 d i + ∑ i ≠ j N F j ( x i - x j ) + 2 D W ˙, ( 1 ) where N gives the number of chromosomes and Fj is the force between two chromosomes, which is obtained as the negative gradient of the potential energy U F j ( x i - x j ) = - ∇ U ( x i - x j ). ( 2 ) The potential energy is defined using the Morse potential [28] U ( x i - x j ) = { C r 1 e - | x i - x j | ℓ r 1 - C a e - | x i - x j | ℓ a, j hom., C r 1 e - | x i - x j | ℓ r 1 + C r e - | x i - x j | ℓ r, j nhom. ( 3 ) Three components in Eq ( 1 ) are noteworthy. First, there is a translational velocity term ( v0di ) defining a chromosome’s present straight-line motion as one component of its total velocity. We refer to this as the chromosome’s translational velocity because it is a straight-line motion in the direction the chromosome is already moving. The velocity ( v0 ) is multiplied by a chromosome’s dimensionless orientation di = vi/‖vi‖, a unit vector in the direction of the chromosome’s velocity. di can be changed by collisions with other chromosomes or with the nuclear envelope as well as by thermal noise. In living cells, directed chromosome movement is typically generated by cytoplasmic motile filaments which are connected to chromosome ends ( telomeres ) via the conserved SUN-KASH protein complex [14–17]. The second term in Eq ( 1 ) is the force Fij between chromosomes i and j, which is the negative of the gradient of the potential Uij ( x - x ). The force is attractive for homolog and repulsive for non-homous. The third term in Eq ( 1 ) is the thermal noise W˙, representing random motion of chromosomes due to thermal fluctuations in the nucleus. The potential U ( x - x ) in Eq ( 2 ) is defined in Eq ( 3), which has three components for homolog and non-hom interactions. For hom, the potential is attractive and for nonom the repulsive. The parameters in Eq ( 3) are C1, C, ℓ1, r1, C, ℓ, r, a, and ℓ, r. C1 are constants and ℓ1, ℓ, ℓ, and ℓ r are length scales for the attractive and repulsive components respectively. The Morse potential in Eq ( 3) has been used to model interactions in various biological systems [28, 29]. The parameters in Eq ( 3) are determined by fitting to experimental data from fixated surface-spread yeast nuclei [13]. The Morse potential in Eq ( 3) has two components for hom and nonom interactions. For hom, the potential is attractive and for nonom the repulsive. The parameters in Eq (3) are C, C, ℓ, r, C, ℓ, a, and ℓ r. are constants and ℓ, ℓ ℓ and ℓ are length scales for the attractive and repulsive components respectively.

    Title: 
    Article: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. MicroRNA miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene. Interestingly, miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans. Zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c have similar expression timing in development, but miR-34a is more abundant. DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/ R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a. Through transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization ( hpf ), we characterized DNA damage-induced transcription, and at 8, 28 and 72 hpf we determined potential miR-34a-regulated genes. At 72 hpf, loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA, but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation. 
 The p53 tumor suppressor is essential for cellular homeostasis by responding to DNA damage and other potentially oncogenic stimuli [1]. Under normal conditions, p53 protein levels are tightly controlled; however, stressors ( e. g. DNA damage, oncogene activation ) stabilize and modify p53 to activate it and increase its levels [1]. Upon activation, p53 translocates to the nucleus and activates its target genes [2], which regulate key genes involved in cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, DNA repair, autophagy, transcriptional regulation, metabolism, and the regulation of p53 [1, 3]. TP53 mutations cause cancer predisposition, are found in most sporadic cancer types at about 30% mean frequency, and germline TP53 mutations are the primary cause of the Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome ( LFS ) [4]. microRNA ( miRNA ) genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer enzyme complexes, and then mature 21–25 nucleotide miRNAs associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex to target mRNA by base complementarity. This leads to mRNA translational repression by blocking ribosome recruitment or induces mRNA cleavage [5]. p53 transcriptionally up-regulates many miRNA genes: the miR-34 family of miRNAs and more than 20 other miRNA genes; while a few miRNA genes, such as the miR-17/92 cluster are down-regulated by p53 [6]. Moreover, p53 itself is regulated by more than 20 microRNAs such as miR-125b which negatively controls p53 levels [7]. The miR-34 gene family in most vertebrates consists of miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes. The miR-34a gene is expressed nearly ubiquitously and in most tissues at a much higher level than miR-34b/c, which is expressed predominantly in the mammalian brain, lungs, testes and fallopian tubes [8]. MIR34A was the first microRNA gene identified as a p53 target, which is consistent with evidence that miR-34a overexpression stimulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [9–12]. Later studies revealed that multiple types of cancer exhibit hypermethylation and down-regulation of miR-34a or all miR-34 genes, as well as a worse prognosis for tumors with low miR-34 expression levels, suggesting a role of the miR-34 family as tumor suppressors [13, 14]. miR-34a is also a known p53 pathway modifier in LFS, where TP53 missense mutations were strongly associated with MIR34A promoter hypermethylation in tumors compared to the surrounding healthy tissue; this hypermethylation was associated with a poorer prognosis in choroid plexus carcinoma patients [15]. Additional strong evidence for the role of miR-34a in tumor suppression came from the study by Öner et al. [16] showing a cooperation between tissue-specific deletion of Tp53 and MiR-34a in a chemically-induced mouse model of colorectal cancer. These authors also found in large patient cohorts a significant association of poorer survival of patients with primary colorectal cancer that harbor mutant TP53 and show MIR34A silencing vs those who are TP53 mutant alone. An experimental study of KrasG12D-mediated oncogenesis in the tp53+/- mice showed that loss of Mir34a dramatically increased tumor size and frequency [17]. The mouse Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ( APC ) mutant intestinal cancer model ( ApcMin/+ ) revealed both Mir34a and Mir34b/Mir34c genes were required for tumor suppression since loss of all three Mir34s increased tumor size and aggressiveness [18]. miR-34a performs its functions by inhibiting translation and stability of its target mRNAs, which encode proteins involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ), metastasis, stemness and metabolism [19]. The inhibitory effects of miR-34a on cell-cycle progression are mediated via down-regulation of cyclin D1 and E2, cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, as well as of c-Myc, N-Myc and E2F Transcription Factor 3 ( E2F3 ). Apoptosis is generally induced by overexpression of miR-34a due to repression of multiple anti-apoptotic genes ( e. g. BCL2, BIRC5, XIAP1, ALDH2, ATF1, YY1 ) [19]. miR-34a also inhibits negative regulators of p53, such as HDM4 [17], MDM4 [20] and SIRT1 [21], thus augmenting the p53 response. Further, inactivation of miR-34a was shown to attenuate the p53 response, and overexpression of miR-34a appeared to increase apoptosis [10, 12]. Navarro and Lieberman challenged the simple positive miR-34a-p53 feedback model by showing that about a quarter of p53 target genes are direct targets of miR-34a, that both miR-34a and p53 have independent functions [22], and that a lack of miR-34a in human cells did not affect the p53 response. Similarly, mice lacking all three Mir34 genes had apparently normal p53 function [23], demonstrating that miR-34s are not essential but rather play a fine-tuning role in the p53 pathway. Thus, these studies show that there is likely context-dependence and more detailed in vivo animal model work is required to understand miR-34a-p53 interactions [19]. The zebrafish is highly suitable for studies of tp53, other tumor suppressors and cancer modeling [24]. However, little is known about the functions of miR-34 genes in this species apart from observations of miR-34a expression in specific brain regions [25]. A later study showed the maternal contribution of miR-34a, some gene expression changes and hindbrain abnormalities after its knock-down, but these observations were not linked [26]. By contrast, knock-down of miR-34b affected multi-ciliated kidney cells leading to disruption of renal development; mechanistically miR-34b acts upstream of the myb gene essential for kidney development [27]. Complete knock-out of miR-34a in zebrafish also elevates sperm motility and fertilization rate [28]. In this study, we characterized zebrafish miR-34a and its functional interactions with tp53, as well as its independent effects by performing transcriptomic, mutant and overexpression studies. We generated and employed miR-34a mutant zebrafish to determine the effects of its loss on gene expression under normal conditions at three stages of development, which revealed a spectrum of transcriptomic effects. We demonstrated that expression of miR-34 genes is partially dependent on p53 under control conditions, and their induction by DNA damage is fully p53-dependent. Moreover, we found that miR-34a has small but significant transcriptomic effects in 28 hour post-fertilization ( hpf ) zebrafish embryos under both control and DNA damage conditions. The most direct evidence of miR-34a tumor-suppressive functions was provided by the earlier tumor onset in compound miR-34a and tp53 mutants compared to the corresponding single tp53 mutants. Transient overexpression of miR-34a induced a greater sensitivity in zebrafish embryos to camptothecin ( CPT ) treatment but not to γ-irradiation, indicating that mi-34 is involved in the p53 pathway. We also found that loss of mi-34 increased erythrocyte levels and up-regulated my-positive hematopoietic stem cells in 72 hpf zraf embryos. Overexpression of mi-34 suppressed reporter mRNA but not p53 induction and sensitized embryos to camptecin but not γ-irradiation.

    Title: 
    Article: Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites, xol-1 is expressed at very low levels. XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C. elegans males, but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos. Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division, as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost. Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes, and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape. Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes, and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites. 
 Embryogenesis is the sequential process of the development of an embryo from fertilization to birth or hatching. Several molecular mechanisms during early embryogenesis have major impacts on the formation and development of the embryo. Two of these are the processes of sex determination and, in some organisms, dosage compensation. Activation of the appropriate sex determination pathways in particular is a critical step in the developmental pathways that regulate sexual reproduction. Within the context of multicellular organisms that have heterogametic sexes, sex determination is an important step that is established very early during embryogenesis. In the case of the nematode C. elegans, activation of the appropriate sex determinations pathway in the two sexes is based on the number of X chromosomes in the developing embryo [1, 2]. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes, whereas males only have a single X chromosome. Activation of the appropriate sex determination pathways in both hermaphrodites and males are important for the development of sexually dimorphic anatomy and sexually specialized cells. In C. elegans, hermaphrodites and males differ extensively in their appearance and behavior, and ~30–40% of somatic cells in adults are known to be sexually specialized [3]. Some of these sexually specialized somatic cells, such as sex-specific neuronal cells, arise during early embryogenesis [4]. In addition, hermaphrodite embryos also need to activate dosage compensation [5]. Dosage compensation is the process through which organisms with chromosome-based methods of sex determination equalize gene expression from sex chromosomes between the two sexes. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes and the males have only one. This poses a challenge since the X chromosomes contain many genes that are not involved specifically in sex determination. Organisms across the animal kingdom have significant divergence in their molecular mechanisms for achieving dosage compensation. In mammals, there is near complete inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes of the female to match the transcriptional output from the single X chromosome in males [6]. Other organisms such as Drosophila and birds have their own unique mechanisms to establish dosage compensation which involve hyperactivation of one of the sex chromosomes, though in the case of birds the hyperactivation is incomplete [7, 8]. In the case of C. elegans, the transcriptional output of both the hermaphrodite X chromosomes is repressed by half to match that of the single male X chromosome through the activity of the dosage compensation complex ( DCC ) [5]. XOL-1 is the master switch that regulates both sex determination and dosage compensation in the C. elegans [9, 10]. XOL-1 acts as a sensor that can be toggled on or off depending on the ratio of signal elements from the X chromosome and the autosomes [9]. These elements on the X chromosome such as sex-1, sex-2, ceh-39 and fox-1 are known as X signal elements ( XSEs ) and those on the autosomes such as sea-1 and sea-2 are known as autosome signal elements ( ASEs ) [1, 11–16]. The ratio of these elements differs between the two C. elegans sexes. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes resulting in an X: A ratio of 1, whereas the males only have one X chromosome resulting in an X:A ratio of 0. 5. XSEs and ASEs compete to repress and activate expression of the xol-1 gene in early embryos, respectively [15]. Due to the lower X:A ratio in males, transcription of XOL-1 is activated. XOL-1 then represses SDC-1, SDC-2 and SDC-3, which leads to the activation of the male sex determination pathway and the repression of hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation [1, 9, 10]. In hermaphrodites, due to the higher X:A ratio, the reverse occurs where XOL-1 is repressed. Hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation pathways are then activated, and male development is shut down [9]. While sex determination and dosage compensation are related pathways and are regulated by a common pathway during in the early stages of embryogenesis in C. elegans, the two pathways eventually diverge and can be regulated independently [10, 17]. The SDC proteins influence both sex determination and dosage compensation, but the two pathways are independently regulated by the targets of the SDC proteins. Modulation of the SDC proteins can affect sex determination through their transcriptional regulation of the her-1 gene [17]. In hermaphrodites, the SDC proteins repress her-1, a gene important for male development. her-1 activates the male sex determination pathway, and represses the hermaphrodite sex determination pathway [18, 19]. In addition to the repression of her-1 in hermaphrodites, the SDC proteins also turn on dosage compensation by activating the DCC [17]. The DCC binds to recruitment sites on the X chromosome and spreads along the length of the chromosome to repress transcription [20–23]. The DCC and the additional ancillary pathways it recruits use multiple mechanisms to establish and maintain dosage compensation on the hermaphrodite X chromosomes throughout somatic tissues in larvae and adults [24–28]. These include X-specific deposition of H4K20me1 repressive mark by DPY-21 [27–30], tethering of H3K9me2/me3 regions to the nuclear lamina [25], contributions by the nuclear RNAi machinery [24], and the formation of TADs on the X chromosomes [26, 31]. The initiation of dosage compensation in developing hermaphrodite embryos is linked to a loss in developmental plasticity and the onset of cellular differentiation programs [32, 33]. Several post-translational histone modifications are known to contribute to both the processes of dosage compensation and the loss of developmental plasticity. One of these are the H3K9me2/me3 marks that are important for regulating the timeline of several processes during embryogenesis. These histone modifications are known to affect the timing of heterochromatin formation in early embryos [33, 34]. H3K9me1/me2/me3 all contribute to the anchoring of heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery in both embryo and larval stages [33, 35]. Loss of H3K9me2 specifically has been shown to result in delayed loss of developmental plasticity [36]. Deposition of the H3K9me2 modification in embryos is regulated by the SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase MET-2 [37, 38]. Since xol-1 is a zygotically transcribed gene that needs to be transcriptionally repressed for the proper development of a hermaphrodite embryo, it has been assumed to be a male-specific gene. It was shown that in early hermaphrodite embryos, xol-1 is briefly transcribed at low levels [9] but it was assumed to be unlikely to be able to activate its downstream transcriptional program [9, 39]. In this paper we confirm that xol-1 is transcribed in hermaphrodite early embryos at low levels, but contrary to previous assumptions we also show that the loss of xol-1 results in significant changes in the transcriptional profile of these early embryos. We also show that xol-1 mutant embryos show accelerated hermaphrodite embryonic development as well as precocious establishment of dosage compensation and sex determination pathways. Finally, we show that several of these phenotypes are partially mediated through transcriptional regulation of the H3K9 histone methyltransferase MET-2. 
 To characterize the transcriptional changes in xol- mutant heraphrod embryos, we used a combination of bioinformatics and imaging techniques. We found that x- mutant hermrod embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division as well as a more advanced developmental transcriptional program compared to wild-type hermrod embryos. We also found that xol- mutant herrod embryos have increased expression of the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 as well as altered H3K9me landscape. These effects of the loss of x- were partially reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that x- plays an important role in regulating developmental timing in hermrod embryos and that MET- acts as a downstream effector of x- activity in hermrod.

    Title: 
    Article: Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ) : a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness, and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. 
 Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever continue to pose a major public health burden throughout much of the world. Gene drive-modified mosquitoes have been proposed as a potentially transformative tool to complement currently-available tools by biasing inheritance in favor of an introduced allele [1]. Progress has been made in Anopheles malaria vectors towards two general classes of gene drive strategies: i ) “population replacement”, whereby inheritance is biased in favor of an allele that confers refractoriness to pathogen transmission [2, 3]; and ii ) “population suppression”, whereby vector populations are suppressed by biasing inheritance in favor of an allele that induces a severe fitness cost or sex bias [4, 5]. In Aedes arboviral vectors, a “split drive” system has been engineered with Cas and guide RNA ( gRNA ) drive components at separate loci [6]. Split drive systems display transient drive behavior because the Cas and gRNA components frequently co-occur following a release, but soon dissociate and are eliminated by virtue of fitness costs. The potential spread and scale of impact of this technology is promising; however, surveillance programs present a major cost driver as they must scale with the intervention [7, 8]. Surveillance for gene drive projects will be required to monitor the effectiveness of the strategy at field sites, as has been done for previous self-limiting genetic control projects [9]; however, a more demanding task will be to detect unintended spread of gene drive alleles beyond field sites, and to detect the emergence of alternative alleles both within and beyond field sites. One concern for these systems is the emergence of drive-resistant alleles which, especially for population suppression strategies, would have a significant fitness advantage over intact drive alleles, leading vector populations to rebound [10, 11]. This is also a concern for population replacement strategies, as when the drive has spread and there are fewer cleavable wild-type alleles remaining, less costly resistant alleles may replace the drive alleles, reducing their duration of impact [12]. Another concern for population replacement strategies is the emergence and spread of drive alleles lacking a functional effector gene [13]. For spread beyond field sites, open questions relate to the optimal density and placement of traps and the frequency of sampling required to detect gene drive alleles, drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes while they can still be effectively managed. Similar questions relate to the spread of new alleles conferring resistance to other interventions, such as bednets or indoor residual spraying with insecticides. Lessons may be learned from studies of invasive species, a key result for which is that early detection is critical to minimizing invasion impact, preserving the possibility of local elimination, and maximizing the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs [14, 15]. To this end, we present MGSurvE: an analytical framework that optimizes trap placement for surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. MGSurvE takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit—namely, resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., blood and sugar-based food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) and movement of mosquitoes between these resources on a landscape. It also accommodates traps with differing attractiveness profiles. MGSurvE may be used in parallel with MGDrivE [16] or MGDrivE 2 [17] to determine the expected distribution of times to detection or the number of individuals having the allele of interest at this time point in closed populations. We describe how to set up, run and interpret output from MGSurvE, and provide examples of trap placement optimization for an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the tropical island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. We then conclude with a discussion of future modeling needs and applications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations. 
 Before the distribution of traps can be optimized, a landscape must first be specified. In MGSurvE, the landscape is a metapopulation within which discrete mosquito population nodes are distributed. The appropriate scale at which populations are modeled depends on the species of interest and the resolution at which optimized trap placement is desired. For instance, a household scale may be adequate for Ae. aegypti populations, which are thought to be relatively local dispersers usually found within 50 m of the breeding site they hatched from [19, 20], while a village scale may be more appropriate for An. gambiae populations, which disperse over distances of up to 7 km [21]. In this initial version of MGSurvE, all sites are assumed to have equal population size. Nodes in MGSurvE may also represent specific resources—e. g., blood and sugar sources for feeding, and water sources for egg-laying—the inclusion of which allows traps to be distributed in relation to these. Landscapes in MGSurvE may be sex-specific, which is particularly relevant if specific resources are included, as only females blood-feed and lay eggs, while both females and males sugar-feed. Once a point set of mosquito population nodes has been defined, the next step is to define the daily per-capita movement probabilities between each pair of nodes. Movement is assumed to be Markovian ( i. e., the conditional distribution of future states depends only on the current state ), and is calculated from dispersal kernels, which derive relative daily movement probabilities from the distance between each pair of coordinates and the density of other sites in the vicinity of the focal site. The base MGSurvE implementation provides functions to implement exponential decay, long-tailed exponential and zero-inflated exponential kernels; which encompass a basic family of short-distance flight-types for mosquitoes. The zero-inflated exponential, for example, takes into account the Aedes’ tendency to dwell in a given point only to fly to nearby locations; whereas Anopheles disperse further from their immediate neighborhood, which can be characterized by a decaying-exponential kernel. However, the MGSurvE framework is not limited to these, and any function that takes two node coordinates and the required parameters can be defined and used. In the event that specific resources are included in a landscape, movement probabilities are modified by a “masking matrix, ” which is determined by the resource type of the mosquito’s current node. For instance, a mosquito currently in a node with blood-feeding resources may be more likely to seek a node with water for egg-laying. This type of movement is similar to that of the MBITES framework ( Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator ) [22]. With a point set and movement probabilities defined, the final step in specifying the landscape is to define and incorporate traps, the positions of which will be updated through the iterations of the optimization process. MGSurvE can incorporate a wide range of traps ( e. g., BG Sentinel traps, CDC light traps, ovitraps, etc. ), which may differ in their attractiveness as defined by parameters and attributes such as mean radius of attractiveness, mosquito sex, and resource type of the current mosquito node. For instance, an ovitrap will be most likely to attract nearby female mosquitoes that are currently in a node with a food resource and hence may soon seek an egg-laying site. Of note, specific traps can be flagged as “immovable, ” so the positions of other traps may be optimized given the fixed trap locations. The trap attractiveness profiles are used to modify the movement probabilities of the movement matrix, and it is this modified matrix that is used by the optimization algorithm to optimize trap placement. A demonstration of landscape specification on a six-node metapopulation with resource types is provided in the project’s documentation. Once the landscape has been specified, the next step is to run the optimization algorithm to find the optimal trap placement. This is done by minimizing the expected time to detection of an allele of interest, which is defined as the expected number of days until the first detection of an individual with the allele of interest in the population. The algorithm is based on simulated annealing, which iteratively updates the positions of traps to minimize the expected time to detection. In each iteration, a trap is randomly selected and moved to a new position, and the expected time to detection is recalculated. If the new position results in a lower expected time to detection, the move is accepted, otherwise it is rejected. The process is repeated until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a minimum expected time to detection. The output of the algorithm is a set of trap positions that minimize the expected time to detection of the allele of interest, which can be visualized on the landscape. We provide examples of trap placement for Aedes aegyti in Queensland, Australia, and Anophe gambia on the island of São Tomé São and Prncipe, and further examples are provided in the project’s documentation. The output of MGS can be used in conjunction with MGDrE [16] or MGDrE 2 [17] to determine the expected distribution of times or number of individuals with the allele of interest at a given point in time in the population. We conclude with a discussion of future needs and applications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.

    Title: 
    Article: Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet, 1999 is a tiny ( 1. 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote. The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum, however, like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known. We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S. scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24, but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses. Instead, numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV, BpV, and MpV, respectively ). Using the BpV genome as a reference, we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257, and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which we collectively call SsVs. A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. Overall, we conclude that S. scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is associated with giant viruses. 
 Understanding the evolutionary history of eukaryotes is inherently linked to understanding their symbiotic relationships with prokaryotes, whether it is in the form of genetically integrated organelles or the multitude of short-term endosymbioses with bacteria or archaea. Most of our understanding about the effects of endosymbiosis on eukaryotic evolution comes from the origin of mitochondria and plastids, and their involvement in eukaryotic diversification [1–4]. However, the impact of prokaryotic symbioses goes far beyond these rare organellogenesis events, given the diverse nature of symbioses affecting hosts in different ways [reviewed in 5, 6]. Through genome sequencing, prokaryotic symbionts were found to be associated with all major eukaryotic supergroups, involved in a myriad of functions such as metabolism [5, 7–9], defense [10], parasitism [11, 12], and motility [10, 13]. Additionally, some bacterial lineages have evolved to be “professional symbionts” [6] such as Chlamydiae, Rickettsiales, and Holosporales, consisting entirely of obligate endosymbionts or intracellular parasites of eukaryotic hosts [6, 14–16]. Despite these impacts, most prokaryotic symbionts of eukaryotes are poorly studied, generally only observed with microscopy, and left unidentified and uncharacterized. For example, the only known case of prokaryotic endosymbiosis in non-phototrophic stramenopiles is found in the tiny ( ~1. 4 μm ) bikosia, Symbiomonas scintillans, where two geographically distinct strains were reported to harbour up to 6 endobacteria, and which served as the inspiration for its genus name [17]. The location of these endobacteria within the endoplasmic reticulum was of particular interest, as this is where plastids of phototrophic stramenopiles are located [17, 18]. However, the identity and functional role of these apparent endobacteria has not been further investigated. To identify the endobacterium and its role in such a small protist, we conducted Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) targeting various groups of bacteria and generated amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data of two strains of S. scintillans. This showed the absence of endobacteria of known endosymbiotic lineages. Instead, we observed a viral-like particle by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and recovered three draft viral genomes related to prasinoviruses, namely nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses ( NCLDVs ) belonging to a member of the Phycodnaviridae family [19, 20]. During the course of this work, one strain apparently lost the virus, while the other strain perished, so we were unable to conduct further experiments to verify the nature of the viral association. This work underscores how much is still unknown about endosymbioses, particularly in small heterotrophic protists. We expect that viral association is especially relevant to nano- or pico-eukaryotes, as there may simply not be enough space for endobacteria, and predict more such findings in the future. 
 All strains of S. scintillans used in this study are summarized in S1 Table, with the initial isolation dates and locations, sequencing methods, dates, and locations, and the culture collection centres. Briefly, two S. scintillans culture strains RCC257 and RCC24 were obtained from the Roscoff culture collection ( RCC, France ) on March 7th, 2022. The cultures were grown and maintained in 0. 22 μm filtered and autoclaved marine f/2 media ( 30 PSU ) with an autoclaved rice grain at the University of British Columbia ( UBC ), Canada. The cultures were kept in a 20°C incubator with a 12:12 h light:dark cycle and sub-cultured every two weeks in 30 mL. Using glass micropipettes, approximately 50 to 100 cells from each strain were collected and stored in 5 μL PCR-grade water after two rounds of rinsing in PCR-grade water on April 6th, 2022. The isolated cells were immediately subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw cycles to promote lysis and stored at -80°C until whole genome amplification ( WGA ). Upon receiving the two strains, they were slow to grow ( low culture density and no noticeable movement ) and within 2 months of receipt, the strain RCC24 showed reduced viability and was eventually lost. This was also observed in the RCC, when their cultures perished with no identifiable cause at a similar time ( M. Gachenot, assistant engineer/curator of RCC, personal communication, Oct 12th, 2022 ). In contrast, the strain RCC257 became denser and more active between the first round of cell collection in April 2022 and the second round of cell collection on June 28th, 2022 ( we later suspected this boost of culture viability can be due to resistant cells or loss of viruses–see below ). As a result, we also collected 50 cells from strain RCC257 on June 28th, 2022, for an additional WGA ( hereafter, referred to as RCC257-late ). Independently at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology ( OIST ), Japan, the culture strains RCC257 ( hereafter referred to as RCC257-jp ) and NIES-2589 ( a strain synonymous to RCC24 ) were obtained from the RCC in December 2022, and the Microbial Culture Collection at the National Institute for Environmental Studies ( NIES Collection, Tsukuba, Japan ) in March 2021. Strain NIES-2589 will be hereafter referred to as RCC24-jp. RCC24-jp was cryopreserved at -160°C and was thawed in f/2 medium with an added rice grain. The RCC24-jp cultures were maintained in the same condition as above except with a 10:14 h light:dark cycle, and further processed for amplification-free shotgun metagenomics ( AF-SMG; see Library preparation and sequencing ). Strain RCC257-jp was grown in 20 μm filtered and autoclaved seawater with rice. All cultures were sub-cultured every 4 weeks. Two strains of S. scintillans ( RCC24 and RCC257 ) maintained at UBC were subject to WGA sequencing and one strain RCC24-jp, maintained at OIST was subject to amplification-free shotgun metagenomic sequencing. To prepare a WGA library of the isolated cells, a 4BBTM TruePrime Single Cell WGA Kit was used following a manufacturer’s protocol with 12 h incubation at 30°C for the amplification reaction step. The amplified product was then cleaned with AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter, US ), following a protocol described in the Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit protocol ( SQK-LSK110, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK ). Library preparation for WGA sequencing followed the Illumina DNA Preparation kit ( Illumina, US ) which uses a Bead-linked Transposome complex, resulting in ~350 bp library constructs. The WGA sequencing was performed on a NextSeq ( mid-output ) platform with 150 bp paired-end library constructs at the UBC Sequencing and Bioinformatics Consortium ( UBC, Canada ). AFMG-S was performed on RCC24p and RCC-j at OIST using the Nanop Ligation Sequencing Kit SQ-LS110 ( Oxford Nanop Technologies ) with a bead-based library preparation. The sequencing was done on the Nanop 550 ( ) platform with 150 bp paired-end library at OIST. Genome assembly was performed using the SPAdes assembler [21] for both WGA and AF-SMG data. Contigs were annotated with Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline ( PGAP ) [22]. The viral contigs were further annotated with Viral Genome Annotation Pipeline ( VGP ) [23]. The contigs were also searched against the NCBI nr database using BLAST [24]. The viral contigs were also searched against the Phodiridae database [19, 20]. FISH was performed on RCC257 and RCC24 using probes targeting the 16S rRNA of various bacterial lineages [25, 26]. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on RCC257 and RCC using a JEOL JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV at the University of British Columbia.

    Title: 
    Article: The leiomodin ( Lmod ) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function, highlighted by the fact that mutations in all three family members ( LMOD1-3 ) result in human myopathies. Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform, LMOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense, or frameshift, mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed. We show here that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular mechanism which eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, we generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutant LMOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant protein expression. Our investigation lays the initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies. 
 The leiomodin ( LMOD ) family of actin-binding proteins are critical for proper function of all types of muscle in humans. A biallelic mutation in LMOD1, the smooth muscle-specific LMOD family member, leads to megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, a visceral myopathy characterized by defective contractile activity of muscles that line the bladder and intestine [1]. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LMOD3, the isoform predominant in skeletal muscle, result in nemaline myopathy, a skeletal muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness ( there are >20 mutations reported to date ) [2–6]. Additionally, disease causing mutations have been found in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2. We reported the first known case of a mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ) that results in severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) [7]. Subsequently, a second case confirmed the pathogenicity of this mutation [8]. Additional mutations in LMOD2 have been discovered that also result in early-onset DCM and death [9–11]. The mutations are biallelic in all individuals, with three homozygous for the same mutation ( c. 273+1G>A, p. W398*, or p. L415Vfs*108 ) [7, 8, 10, 11] and one consisting of compound heterozygous mutations ( p. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) [9]. All data to date suggest that Lmod-linked muscle diseases have the common underlying pathophysiology of short thin filaments, reduced muscle contractility and severe muscle weakness. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD family of genes are nonsense or frameshift mutations which are predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in most cases, little to no LMOD protein is expressed [1, 2, 7]. In the case of the patient with the first described disease-causing mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ), LMOD2 protein was not detected in the explanted heart via western blot analysis and RT-qPCR analysis revealed a decrease in mature LMOD2 mRNA levels, but no change in pre-mRNA levels [7]. Thus, we hypothesized that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) underlies loss of mutant protein expression. Two additional LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( p. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) are predicted to produce truncated proteins, however information is lacking regarding whether, and to what extent, protein is expressed [9, 10]. NMD is a surveillance system whereby the cell detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons ( PTCs ), however NMD also regulates the levels of certain non-mutated, functional transcripts [12, 13]. Although not completely understood, there are multiple proposed pathways by which transcripts are identified and fated for degradation [14]. One mechanism involves deposition of the multi-protein exon junction complex ( EJC ) upstream of exon-exon boundaries during RNA splicing [15]. The EJC remains bound to the transcript and is normally removed by the ribosome during translation. However, if a ribosome pauses at a PTC, 1 ) the SURF ( SMG1/8/9-UPF1-eRF1-eRF3 ) complex of proteins can associate with the ribosome and 2 ) downstream EJCs remain intact. The downstream EJCs then recruit proteins ( e. g., UFP3B and/or UPF2 ) that promote activation of the SURF complex, transforming it into the decay-inducing ( DECID ) complex, leading to degradation of the transcript [16]. In this study we discovered that multiple human LMOD2 mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy lead to a lack of LMOD2 protein expression through NMD. We also developed steric-blocking oligonucleotides to specifically inhibit NMD of LMOD2 transcripts, increasing the levels of mutant-truncated protein. 
 The human LMOD2 gene consists of 3 exons and 2 introns. In order to study the effects of disease-causing mutations on LMOD2 mRNA and protein levels we generated human LMOD2 gene constructs consisting of the coding sequence plus both introns ( gene [G] ), the coding sequence plus intron 2 only ( minigene [MG] ), and the coding sequence alone ( CDS ) ( Fig 1A ). Protein expression of constructs with and without patient mutations was analyzed in a human cell line ( AD-293, which are derived from HEK293 cells ) that does not express detectable levels of LMOD2 protein via western blot analysis, providing an LMOD2-free background in which to study the effect of mutations on LMOD2 protein levels. Introduction of a disease-causing mutation ( W398* ) into the LMOD2 CDS construct results in a truncated protein whose expression level is slightly lower than wild type CDS ( average of 89% of wild type levels ), although the decrease is not statistically significant; p = 0. 14, one sample t-test ( Fig 1B ). Note, the truncated protein sometimes resolves as two bands that are close in size. Conversely, the mutation results in a significant decrease in LMOD2 protein levels when introduced into constructs containing introns ( MG and G ) ( ~20–30% of wild type [WT] levels, Fig 1B ). Protein levels are reduced to the same extent in the construct with both introns ( G ) and the construct without intron 1 ( MG ), indicating that only the presence of intron 2 is necessary for loss of mutant protein. To determine if there are specific regulatory sequences within intron 2 responsible for regulating the levels of LMOD2, intron 2 was replaced with the second intron of the human β-globin gene. The reduction of mutant protein levels was similar regardless of the sequence, or length, of intron 2 ( Fig 1B ). We next tested two other LMOD2 mutations that lead to DCM in humans. LMOD2 R513* resulted in a significant decrease in mutant protein levels only when present in the MG construct ( ~25% of WT levels, Fig 1C ), while LMOD2 V415fs*108 mutant levels were only slightly lower compared to WT in the MG construct ( ~90% of WT levels, Fig 1D ). However, the latter mutation resulted in an increase in protein levels when inserted into the CDS construct ( ~130% of WT levels, Fig 1D ), resulting in a significant difference in the relative mutant proteins levels in the CDS vs MG constructs. These results suggest that the V415fs*108 mutation leads to increased stability of mutant protein and both mutants result in loss of protein when expressed from constructs containing introns, although the R513* mutant to a much larger degree. To determine whether the decrease in mutant LMOD2 protein levels corresponds to a reduction in LMOD2 transcript levels we employed reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR ). The addition of W398* and R513* mutations result in a decrease of LMOD2 MG mature mRNA levels but have no effect on LMOD2 CDS mature mRNA levels, when compared to their respective WT constructs ( Fig 2A ). Mutant LMOD2 MG pre-mRNA levels are not significantly different than WT pre-mRNA levels ( Fig 2A ). This indicates that loss of LMOD2 is occurring post-transcriptionally. Activation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) requires an initial round of translation, therefore blocking translation should result in the accumulation of transcripts containing PTCs, if NMD indeed contributes to loss of mature mutant LMOD2 transcript. To test for this, we treated AD-293 cells expressing LMOD2 MGs with and without the W398* or R513* mutations with 100 μg/mL of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) for 4–5 h. RT-qPCR analysis revealed an increase in mature mRNA levels following treatment with CHX vs vehicle ( VEH ) alone, while pre-mRNA levels remained unchanged ( Fig 2B ). These data are consistent with NMD as the underlying mechanism responsible for the decrease in mutant transcript levels. We hypothesized that NMD could be inhibited by blocking the deposition of the exon junction complex ( EJC ) upstream of exon-exon junctions during splicing. To test this, we designed antisense oligonucleotides ( AONs ) that bind to the exon-exon junctions of L2 and prevent the formation of the EJC ( Fig 3A ). ONs were transfected into AD-293 cells expressing L2 MG with the W* or R* mutations. RT-qPCR analysis revealed an increase in L2 mature mRNA levels in cells treated with ONs compared to VEH ( Fig 3B ), while preRNA levels remained unchanged ( Fig 3 ). These results indicate that blocking the EJC formation prevents NMD of mutant L2 transcripts, leading to increased levels of mutant-truncated protein ( Fig 3C ). To determine the efficacy of ONs in rescuing mutant L2 protein, western blot analysis was performed on extracts from cells treated with ONs or V ( Fig 3 ). ONs resulted in a significant increase in L2 protein levels compared to V ( Fig 3 ). These results demonstrate that blocking the EJC prevents NMD of mutant L2 transcripts, leading to increased levels of mutant-truncated L2 protein. In conclusion, we show that NMD is responsible for the loss of mutant L2 protein in dilated cardiomyopathy caused by two L2 disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, we developed antisense oligonucleotides that block the formation of the EJC, preventing NMD of mutant L2 transcripts, thereby increasing levels of mutant-truncated L2 protein. These findings lay the groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in L-linked myopathies.

    Title: 
    Article: Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2, 3, or 4 ). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology. 
 Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) is one of the lipoproteins used for the transport of lipids and cholesterol throughout the body and the primary transporter in the brain. The three major subtypes of human ApoE—ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4—differ by 2 amino acids and exhibit allelic frequencies of 8. 4%, 77. 9%, and 13. 7%, respectively. [1, 2] The ApoE3 allele is considered the normal or wild-type, and the behavior of the E2 or E4 isoforms differs in measurable ways. The ApoE2 protein isoform, characterized by an R158C substitution relative to the ApoE3, has been associated with decreased affinity for the LDL receptor [3, 4], while the ApoE4 protein isoform, which features a C112R substitution relative to ApoE3, favors binding to very-low-density lipoprotein receptors [3, 4]. Thus, these seemingly minor genotypic changes may lead to modified receptor mediated signaling, lipid availability and metabolic function, or a combination of factors. Both ApoE2 and E4 modulate disease risk relative to ApoE3. For example, Ferrer et al. [5] observed a ~5-fold increase in Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ) prevalence in carriers of the ApoE4 allele relative to ApoE3 carriers and a decreased risk ( ~0. 5 fold ) in individuals expressing the ApoE2 allele. Although ApoE2 expression protects against AD, its expression is associated with the increased incidence of familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia—a disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize lipids including cholesterol and triglycerides. [6] ApoE isoforms have also been implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease [7], vascular pathology [8], and most recently, COVID-19 prognosis[9]. Some mechanistic details have been identified for how the ApoE alleles modulate an individual’s risk for disease. ApoE is a transporter of amyloidβ [10–13], a widely recognized biomarker in AD development. ApoE-isoforms modulate brain mRNA expression, presumably in response to changes in lipid availability[14] as well as direct transcriptional effects. [15] Here we used both quantitative and kinetic proteomics to explore the impact of human ApoE genotypes in the proteome of mice ( Fig A in S1 File ). Both approaches leverage liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) to identify and quantify thousands of proteins ( Fig 1A ). We apply a simplified kinetic model of proteostasis ( Figs 1B and B in S1 File ) combining turnover rate and concentration data to reveal ApoE isoform-dependent regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. We investigated the liver and brain, because there is strong evidence that of the ~16 major apolipoproteins, only ApoA1 can cross the blood brain barrier. [16] So although chemically identical, ApoE is found in two separate pools. The brain produces its own ApoE using astrocytes [4, 17], whereas ApoE for the rest of the body is produced in the liver by hepatocytes [8, 18]. Our analysis identifies key brain-specific proteostasis changes, as evidenced by pathway-level differences in synthesis and degradation. Building upon a significant body of literature and this proteome scale study, we propose a unifying mechanism wherein ApoE alleles systemically impact cellular proteostasis through alterations in endosomal trafficking, mitochondrial function, and proteo-lysosomal activity. 
 In our analysis, we identified 4, 849 proteins in the brain tissue across the three ApoE-isoform groups ( n = 47 ). From these, we determined protein abundance and turnover rate FCs for comparisons: ApoE2 vs. ApoE3 ( E2vsE3 ) and ApoE4 vs. ApoE3 ( E4vsE3 ). Here, ApoE3 serves as the reference ’normal’ control. We quantified 3, 532 abundance FCs for both the E2vsE3 and E4vsE3 comparisons ( S2 and S3 Tables ). With a smaller number of turnover rate FCs 1, 430 for E2vsE3 and 1, 405 FCs for E4vsE3 because of the more rigorous statistical filtering criteria. We focused on ontologies from six databases: GO Function, GO Component, GO Process, WikiPathways, Reactome, and KEGG. We calculated the average abundance FC ( Δabundance ) and turnover rate FC ( Δturnover ) for the proteins observed in each ontology ( Please refer to the Ontology-level Calculations in the methods section ). This yielded ~2700 ontology-level comparisons of average Δabundance and Δturnover calculations for both E2vsE3 and E4vsE3 ( S4 Table ). The interpretation ( Fig 1C ) relies on the traditional understanding of protein turnover, contextualizing changes in protein expression. It offers a lens to assess the variances in the steady states of ApoE genotypes [19]. Using a one-sample t-test, we discerned which ontologies deviated significantly from a median Δabundance of 0. In the E2vsE3 comparison, we identified 284 protein ontologies with notable Δabundance ( BH-PV < 0. 05 ) ( Fig 1D ). For the E4vsE3 comparison, 287 protein ontologies had significant Δabundance ( BH-PV < 0. 05 ) ( Fig 1E ). The box plots in Figs 2–5 summarize the Δabundance and Δturnover for ontologies with significant Δabundance shifts. To maximize visibility and to accommodate for space limitations, these boxplots do not contain outlier points but Figs C-F in S1 File contain outlier points. Given that some ontologies are repetitive, proteins depicted in the box plots might appear in multiple ontologies with analogous names/functions. When faced with such redundancies, we typically chose the ontology with superior coverage ( Observed/Total ) for representation. As a convention, each ontology is presented in an "ontology name ( n ) " format, where ( n ) indicates the count of quantified proteins within that ontology. Overlap between similar ontologies is shown in the heatmap. We observed that multiple ontologies with significant Δabundance were associated with endocytosis and vesicular processing ( Fig 2 ). Specifically, the general Endocytosis ( 158 ) ontology demonstrated increased Δabundance and decreased Δturnover, suggesting reduced degradation in both ApoE2 and ApoE4 compared to ApoE3. In the context of ApoE2, Clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( 82 ), Clathrin binding ( 35 ), and Clathrin coat ( 26 ) mirrored the same ↓degradation effect observed in endocytosis, while SNARE complex ( 32 ) showed diminished Δabundance and Δturnover, suggesting a decline in protein synthesis compared to ApoE3. Moreover, ApoE2 expression led to significant alterations in several regulatory ontologies tied to endocytosis and vesicular processes, such as: Endocytic recycling ( 34 ) ( ↑synthesis ), Early endosome ( ↑synthesis ), and Regulation of endocytosis ( 15 ) ( ↑synthesis ). In ApoE2, proteins related to Lysosome Vesicle Biogenesis ( 18 ) have lower degradation while Regulation of Endocytosis ( 107 ) had increased synthesis leading to higher abundance of these protein groups and presumably more efficient endolysosomal function. In both ApoE2 ( E2vsE3 ) and ApoE4 ( E4vsE3 ) we observed significant changes in ontologies related to mitochondrial function ( Figs 3–5 ). In ApE4, we observed a lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autagy reducing protein quality. In ApE, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and membrane including oxidative phosphorylation complexes had increased degradation suggesting coordinated replacement of the organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting the ApE-effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology.

    Title: 
    Article: Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development. However, this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues, including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ). To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system, here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. Thus, we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity. 
 Characterization of developmental mechanisms often involves loss-of-function ( LOF ) analysis of genes in organisms. Besides the more traditional methods of LOF, such as whole-organismal mutations and RNA interference ( RNAi ), tissue-specific mutagenesis through the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as another powerful approach [1–5]. In this approach, either Cas9 or gRNAs ( or both ) are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, so that CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of the gene of interest ( GOI ) occurs only in the desired tissues [1, 2, 6, 7]. Although tissue-specific CRISPR can be very effective for studying gene function, its successful application has been limited to a small number of Drosophila tissues, including the germline [1, 8], sensory neurons [9–12], prothoracic gland [13], mushroom body neurons [14], imaginal tissues [7, 9, 10], epidermal cells [9, 10], circadian neurons [15, 16] and cardiomyocytes [17]. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful model for studying many biological processes, such as axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function and plasticity, and locomotion [18–20]. Although CRISPR has been used to tag endogenous proteins at the NMJ [21], tissue-specific CRISPR has not yet been successfully applied to the fly NMJ. NMJs are special synaptic connections formed between motor neurons and somatic muscles [22]. The axon termini of the motor neurons release extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) into the space between axons and muscles [23–26]. Outside the nervous system, EVs can originate from many types of cells and can carry diverse cargos made of all four types of biomolecules ( carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids ) [27]. These vesicles may function in long-distance signal transduction and cell-cell communication and have been shown to play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes [28, 29]. EVs at Drosophila NMJs contain several protein and nucleic acid cargos [23, 30] and regulate synaptic structure and activity by mediating axon-to-muscle signal transduction [23, 25]. So far, studies of the Drosophila NMJ have revealed the requirement of several genes related to intracellular vesicle trafficking and the endocytic pathway in the biogenesis of EVs [24, 26, 29]. However, the mechanisms of EV biogenesis at the fly NMJ are not fully understood, and many pathways that are important for EV production in mammalian cells have not been examined in Drosophila. One example is the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) pathway [31], which comprises five distinct complexes ( ESCRTs -0, -I, -II, and -III, and Vps4 ) that sequentially sort monoubiquitinated membrane cargo and mediate membrane fission in late endosomes and at the plasma membrane. In this study, we generated a tissue-specific CRISPR toolkit for knocking out genes in motor neurons, glia, and somatic muscles, the three cell types of the Drosophila NMJ. This toolkit is based on CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ), a method using tissue-specific expression of Cas9 and ubiquitously expressed gRNAs to knock out genes in the desired tissue [9]. We validated the efficacy of gene knock-out ( KO ) in each of the three tissues. Using these tools, we examined the roles of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) pathway and the ESCRT machinery in NMJ morphogenesis. Our results reveal a requirement for the SNARE pathway in NMJ maintenance and critical functions of ESCRT in EV biogenesis, axonal growth, and intra-axonal membrane trafficking. 
 To apply CRISPR-TRiM in tissues relevant to NMJ biology, we generated several Cas9 lines that are expressed in motoneurons, glial cells, or somatic muscles ( S1A Fig ) by Gal4-to-Cas9 conversion [10], enhancer-fusion [9], or CRISPR-mediated knock-in ( KI ). For motoneurons, we generated wor-Cas9, which should be active in neuronal progenitor cells [32], and three lines ( OK371-Cas9, OK6-Cas9, and OK319-Cas9 ) that should be expressed in post-mitotic motoneurons [10, 33–36]. For glial cells, we previously made repo-Cas9 [10]; for this study, we also generated gcm-Cas9 by inserting Cas9 into the glial cells missing ( gcm ) locus through CRISPR-mediated KI ( S1A and S1B Fig ). gcm-Cas9 is predicted to be active in glial progenitor cells [37, 38]. Lastly, we made a muscle-specific mef2-Cas9 by converting mef2-Gal4 [10] ( S1A Fig ). To evaluate the mutagenesis efficiency in motoneurons, we generated a Cas9 negative tester nSyb-tdGFP; gRNA-GFP. nSyb-tdGFP is expressed in all neurons [9] and labels motoneuron axon terminals ( Fig 1A and 1B ). gRNA-GFP expresses two gRNAs ubiquitously, targeting GFP and EGFP coding sequences [10]. Activities of different Cas9 transgenes can be compared by measuring remaining GFP fluorescence in relevant cells when tested with such negative testers [9]. We examined Ib boutons innervating muscles 4 and 6, as well as Is boutons on muscle 6, in A2-A6 segments. As expected, we observed strong reduction of GFP signals across segments at these NMJs with all four motoneuron or progenitor-cell Cas9 lines ( Figs 1A–1C and S1C ). However, we also noticed some differences among the Cas9 lines: OK371-Cas9 and OK6-Cas9 resulted in more consistent GFP reduction in Ib boutons than wor-Cas9 and OK319-Cas9, but in Is boutons, OK319-Cas9 and OK371-Cas9 reduced GFP more consistently. To test glial Cas9 lines, we generated a second negative tester, gRNA-GFP UAS-mCherry. NLS; repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP. This tester additionally expresses nuclear mCherry in glia, which is important for locating glia when GFP is not visible. We measured GFP levels along intersegmental nerve tracts in segments A2-A6 ( Fig 1D ). While repo-Cas9 resulted in consistently strong ( ≥96% ) reduction of GFP, gcm-Cas9 caused weaker ( 70–88% ) and more variable reduction ( Figs 1E and S1E ). To visualize mef2-Cas9 activity, we used GFP SSA reporter ( GSR ) [10], which ubiquitously expresses a transgene containing an interrupted EGFP-2A-nGFP coding sequence. Cas9 activity is reported by GFP reconstitution, which occurs only when Cas9 causes a breakage at the site of interruption and triggers DNA repair by single-strand annealing ( SSA ) [10]. With GSR, we detected robust GFP signals in somatic muscles from newly hatched to wandering 3rd instar larvae and in the adult abdomen ( Fig 1F ). While using GSR to examine motoneuron Cas9 drivers, we observed OK6-Cas9 activity in many peripheral tissues, including epidermal cells and trachea ( S1D Fig ). Using the lineage-tracing Gal4 reporter tubP ( FRT. stop ) Gal4 UAS-Flp UAS-mRFP [39], we confirmed OK-C9 expression in motone axons ( S1 Fig ). We also observed OK6-C9 activity in muscles ( S1 Fig ). These results indicate that OK-C9 and OK6-C9 are active in both motoneurons and muscles. To validate the efficacy of CRPR-TRM, we simultaneously knocked out two genes in each of the three cell types. For motone, we combined OK-C9 and OK6-C9 with gRNA-GFP. For gl, we combined repo-C9 and g-C9 with gRNA-G. For muscles, we used me2-C9 and OK-C9 with g-G. We observed significant reduction of GFP in all cases ( Figs 2A–C and S2 ). These results demonstrate that CR-TRM can be used to knock out multiple genes in each of the three NMJ cell types. To examine the role of the SNARE pathway in NMJ, we used OK-C9 and OK6-C9 with gRNA targeting the SNARE components SNAP25 and VAMP2 [40, 41]. We observed significant reduction of Ibons innervating muscles 4 and 6 (igs 3A and 3B ) and Is on muscle 6 (igs 3C and 3 ). These results indicate that SNARE is required for NMJ maintenance. To examine the ESC pathway, we used OK-C and OK9 with gRNA targeting ESC-I and ESC-II [42]. We observed reduction of Ibons innerv muscles 4 and 6 (igs 4A and 4 ) and Is on muscle 6 (igs 4 and 4 ). These results suggest that ESC is involved in EV biogenesis and axonal growth. To examine intraaxonal trafficking, we used OK-C and OK9 with gRNA targeting ESC-III and ESC-IV [43]. We observed reduction of Ibons innerv muscles 4 and 6 (igs 5 and 5 ) and Is muscle 6 (igs 5 and ). These results indicate that ESC-III and ESC-IV are required for intraaxonal trafficking of EVs at the NMJ. To examine the role of ESC in retrograde signaling, we used OK-C and OK9 with gRNA targeting ESC-I and ESC-II. We observed reduction of Ibons innerv muscles 4 and 6 (igs 6 and 6 ) and Is muscle 6 (igs 6 ). These results suggest that ESC suppresses retrograde signaling at the NMJ. To examine the relationship between ESC and retrograde signaling, we used OK-C and OK with gRNA targeting ESC-I and ESC-II. We observed reduction of Ibons innerv muscles 4 and 6 (igs 7 and 7 ) and Is muscle 6 (igs 7 ). These results indicate that ESC suppresses retrograde signaling at the NMJ. To examine the relationship between ESC and intraax trafficking, we used OK and OK with gRNA targeting ESC-III and ESC-IV. We observed of Ibons innerv muscles 4 and 6 (igs 8 and 8 ) and Is muscle 6 (igs 8 ). These results indicate that ESC-III and ESCIV are required for intraax trafficking of EVs at the NM. To examine the relationship between retrograde and intraax trafficking we used OK-C and OK with gRNA targeting ESC-I and ESC-II. We observed Ibons innerv muscles 4 and 6 (igs 9 and 9 ) and Is muscle 6 (igs 9 ). These results indicate that ESC-I and ESC-II are required for retrograde and intra trafficking at the NMJ. To examine the relationship between retro and intra trafficking we used OK and OK with gRNA targeting ESC-III and ESC-IV. We observed Ibons

    Title: 
    Article: Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae. During larval stages, the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which is essential to prime them for differentiation. Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. Intriguingly, despite having ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages. Using expression analyses, genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches, we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK. Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1, which is regulated by Relish. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. Our study sheds light on how, during development, integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development. 
 The site for definitive hematopoiesis in Drosophila is the lymph gland, a multi-lobed, larval blood-forming organ [1–5]. During larval development, the prohemocytes within this organ proliferate and differentiate. With the onset of pupation, the entire cohort of hemocytes is released into circulation to take care of post-larval requirements [6, 7]. The mature lymph gland has a well-characterized anterior lobe/primary lobe with three distinct zones and a niche ( Posterior Signaling Center ) crucial for maintaining the bulk of the progenitors [5, 8]. The medially located heterogeneous progenitor cells [9–11] constitute the medullary zone ( MZ ) at the core and distally located rim of intermediate progenitors ( IZ ), while the differentiated hemocytes in the periphery of the organ define the cortical zone ( CZ ) of the primary lobe ( Fig 1A ) [3]. Although the lymph gland progenitors proliferate to increase their number right from the early instar, robust differentiation is noticed only in the third instar stage [3]. It is intriguing how this reserve population within the lymph gland is intercepted from precociously inducting into the differentiation program. Studies have shown that developmentally regulated, moderately high Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) levels in the blood progenitor cells of the Drosophila mature lymph gland elicit c-Jun Kinase ( JNK ) to facilitate their differentiation [12]. Recent studies have also shown that the JNK-FAO axis is essential for progenitor differentiation [13]. We wondered that if ROS triggers differentiation, then why doesn’t the pool of progenitors differentiate entirely? Why does the differentiation of the progenitors initiate at the rim of MZ despite the entire MZ being enriched in ROS? What shields the progenitors from entering the differentiation program even though they are enriched in ROS? Our interrogation identified nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) transcription factor Relish, a component of the immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway, as a key molecule that prevents the progenitor pool from differentiating precociously. Although the Imd/IMD pathway has been studied intensively in immunity and inflammation, its role during fly development has only recently been unraveled. Studies have elucidated the non-inflammatory roles of Relish ( Rel ) in Drosophila neurodegeneration [14–16], apoptosis [17] and autophagy in salivary gland cells [18]. Interestingly, in the absence of infection, persistent activation of IMD in Drosophila intestinal stem cell progenitors increases the frequency of division in Intestinal Stem Cells [19]. Intrinsic Nf-κB activity is shown to be essential in stem cells for repairing damaged gut epithelia in Drosophila adult [20]. During development, Rel in the hematopoietic niche of the lymph gland is crucial for its functionality. Absence of Relish from the niche induces JNK-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement. The aberrant cytoskeletal rearrangement perturbs the proper delivery of Hedgehog from the niche to the adjoining progenitors, leading to their precocious differentiation. Strikingly, Relish is downregulated in the niche during bacterial infection to facilitate an early dispersion of lymph gland resident hemocytes into circulation. The dynamic expression of Relish endorsed that the developmental pathway gets recalibrated in the hematopoietic niche to combat high bacterial infection [21]. Throughout development, the strong presence of Rel in the hemocyte progenitors caught our attention. Employing expression analyses, genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that Rel inhibits activation of JNK and thereby shields off the core progenitors from differentiating. Overexpression of Rel resulted in a halt in the differentiation program. The metabolic input essential for triggering the differentiation of the progenitors is ROS. ROS evokes JNK, which transcriptionally regulates Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I ( CPTI ) /withered ( whd ), the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, to initiate the differentiation of the progenitors [13]. The outcome of the above study demonstrated how cellular signaling machinery collaborates with the metabolic cue to enable the differentiation program. However, it does not take into account how the stockpile of ROS-enriched progenitors is maintained. Here, we show that the metabolic input in the form of ROS is monitored by a developmental signal, which shields the bulk of ROS enriched progenitors from inducting into the differentiation process. As a result, the differentiation program is restricted to the progenitors housed in the outer rim of the Medullary Zone. Our study elucidates how the integration of immune-developmental and metabolic axis is essential for regulating myeloid-like progenitor homeostasis during development. 
 The primary lobe of third instar lymph gland consists of the heterogeneous progenitor, which can be visualized by different markers. Angiotensin ( Ance ), Domeless ( Dome ) and Thioester-containing-protein 4 ( TepIV ) are expressed by the progenitors [1, 11]. The intermediate progenitors are detectable as Dome and Peroxidasin ( Pxn+ ) [11] or Dome and Hemolectin ( Hml+ ) and by CHIZ-Gal4. UAS GFP expression [22]. As evident from the figure, MZ progenitors ( Ance+Pxn- ) express high levels of Relish throughout larval development compared to the CZ ( Fig 1B–1E’ and 1F ). The early onset of Rel expression, along with the differential labeling in the mature lymph gland, prompted us to investigate the role of Rel in blood progenitors during development. A progenitor-specific downregulation of Rel ( tepIV >UAS-Rel RNAi ) revealed a significant reduction in the progenitor pool ( Ance ) ( Fig 1G–1H and 1K ). This observation was further strengthened when CRISPR-mediated knockout of the Rel function from MZ also led to a decline in progenitor number ( Fig 1I and 1K ). The loss in progenitor number was accompanied by an increase in the differentiated cell population ( plasmatocyte: P1 Nimrod [23], Fig 1L–1N, 1P and 1Q ) and Crystal cell: Hindsight, Hnt ( S1A, S1B and S1D Fig ). Despite precocious differentiation observed upon loss of Relish from the progenitors, the lack of lamellocytes ( a specialized class of hemocytes which is generated upon immune challenge, S1E–S1F Fig ) implicated that Rel loss does not evoke an immune response. Interestingly, the lymph gland analysed from germ-free/axenic larvae ( devoid of commensal microflora, S1G Fig ), showed no significant change in the differentiation index when compared to control ( S1H–S1J Fig ). Moreover, the expression of Relish in the progenitors also remained unaltered in an axenic condition ( S1K–S1K” Fig ). Based on these results, we can infer that the commensal microflora does not elicit Relish expression and activation in the progenitors, suggesting a developmental role of NF-κB in blood progenitors. Moreover, in sync with previous report [21], upon bacterial infection there was a decrease in Relish expression from the hematopoietic niche compared to uninfected larvae ( S1L–S1M’ Fig ). In contrast, Relish expression was not affected in the lymph gland progenitors of infected larvae compared to the sham and control lymph glands ( Compare S1N–S1N’, S1O–S1O’, S1P-S1P’ and S1Q Fig ). This set of results implies that in contrast to the niche-specific Rel expression, the progenitor specific expression of Relish is not susceptible to the pathophysiological state of the organism but instead seems to serve as a developmental cue. A similar decline in progenitor number ( Ance+, S1R–S1R’ and S1R”’ Fig ) and increased differentiation (plmatocyte P Nim,1–1–1, S1–1–1 and S–1–1 Fig ) was observed in CRISPR-mediated knockout of Rel function in the MZ ( S1–1–1 and S1–1–1 Fig ). The loss of Rel in progenitors was accompanied by an increase in differentiated population (plmat P Nim,1–1–1, S–1–1 and S–1–1 Fig ) and Crystal Hnt H ( S–1–1,–1 S–1–1 and S–1–1–1 Fig ). In contrast, CRPR knockout of Rel in CZ did not affect the number of progenitors ( S1–1–1 and S–1–1 Fig ) or differentiation ( S–1–1 and S–1–1 Fig ). These results indicate that Rel is crucial for maintaining the progenitor pool in the MZ but not in the IZ or CZ of the primary lobe of the lymph gland. To investigate the mechanism by which Rel shields the progenitors from differentiating, we employed pharmacological and genetic approaches. Overexpression of Rel in the MZ inhibited the activation of JNK ( S1–1–1 and S–1–1 Fig ) and halted the differentiation ( S–1–1 and–1 S1–1 Fig ) of the progenitors. In contrast, overexpression of Rel in IZ or CZ did not affect the activation of J ( S–1–1 and–1 S1–1 Fig ) or differentiation ( S–1–1 and–1–1 Fig ) of the progenitors. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of J in the MZ blocked the differentiation of progenitors ( S–1–1 and–1–1 Fig ) but not in I or CZ (–1–1 and–1–1 Fig ). These results indicate that Rel shields the progenitors from differentiating by inhibiting J activation in the MZ but not in I or CZ of the lymph gland. The input of ROS in the form is monitored by a developmental signal which shields the progenitors from differentiating in the MZ but not in I or CZ of the gland. This developmental ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not entirely exhausted. Our study highlights the integration of NF-κ-like with metabolic pathways is crucial for regulating cell fate during development in the hematopoietic niche of Drosila.

    Title: 
    Article: Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene. Its transcript, the small nuclear RNA U4atac, is involved in the excision of ~850 minor introns. Here, we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNU4ATAC, instead the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A>G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. After deciphering the impact of the variant on the RTTN protein function at centrosome in engineered RTTN-depleted RPE1 cells and patient fibroblasts, we analysed neural stem cells ( NSC ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells and revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest and cell death. In cortical organoids, we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes, by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC. Altogether, these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids, thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly. 
 The Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ), or MOPD1 ( OMIM #210710 ), is a very rare genetic disease with less than 100 reported cases [1–6] characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth delay, severe microcephaly with brain abnormalities ( abnormal gyral pattern, intracranial cyst, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and corpus callosum agenesis ), intellectual deficiency, bone abnormalities, bulging eyes and dry skin with eczema, as well as a premature death during the first months of life for the most severe cases [7–9]. Since the identification of RNU4ATAC in 2011 [10, 11], no other gene has been associated with this disease. RNU4ATAC is a non-coding gene transcribed into the small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) U4atac, a component of the minor spliceosome. This ribonucleic complex excises less than one percent of all human introns [12], and deficiency in its function leads in most cases to minor intron retention that impairs the correct maturation of about 750 minor-intron containing transcripts [2, 13–17]. Here, we report on a patient with clinical features of TALS but no variants in RNU4ATAC. Whole exome sequencing rather revealed she has the homozygous pathogenic missense variant NM_173630: RTTN c. 2953A>G, p. Arg985Gly, which also alters splicing. This gene has already been implicated in human disease, notably “microcephaly, short stature and polymicrogyria with or without seizure” ( MSSP, OMIM #614833 ). Up to now, 39 patients from 23 families have been reported with bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RTTN [18–33] of which 4 patients, from 3 families, have the c. 2953A>G variant. Most of these patients exhibit common features, at variable degrees of severity, including microcephaly with gyral pattern abnormalities, sloping forehead, intellectual deficiency, and pre- and post-natal growth delay. A few patients only were deceased at the time of publication, with one third of them having reached teenage- or adulthood. RTTN encodes the large centrosomal protein Rotatin ( 2, 226 amino-acids ), and was initially discovered by a forward genetic screen in the mouse model, with the particular phenotype of Rttn mutant embryos failing to undergo the axial rotation during embryogenesis [34]. Further investigations demonstrated that Rotatin is essential for procentriole elongation [35], correct cell cycle progression and mitosis [29, 36], and regulation of primary cilium length [18, 29]. Alterations of some of these processes have been shown to contribute to the development of microcephaly [37]. Intrigued by the TALS-like phenotype of the patient with this RTTN variant, we thought to investigate the associated pathophysiological mechanisms leading to microcephaly. For that, we used patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) that were differentiated into neural stem cells ( NSC ) or cortical organoids ( CO ). We carried out a thorough analysis of the impact of the RTTN isoforms resulting from the mutated allele identified in the patient and conducted cellular studies of the centrosome/primary cilium complex and their related functions. Overall, our results establish how RTTN c. 2953A>G variant affects the integrity of the neural stem cell pool, thus leading to improper neuronal cell mass in patients. 
 Blood sample from a child suspected to have Taybi-Linder syndrome was addressed to us for genetic diagnosis. The patient is the only daughter of healthy Moroccan first-cousin parents without any notable medical history reported in the family ( Fig 1A ). The pregnancy was marked by a severe intrauterine growth retardation with brain abnormalities. The baby girl was born at 39 weeks of gestation with a weight of 1695 g ( -4 SD; <0. 01 percentile ), a height of 43 cm ( -4 SD; 0. 04th percentile ) and a head circumference ( HC ) of 22. 5 cm ( -9 SD; <0. 01 percentile ). Radiographic findings revealed a global ossification delay, with a bone age of 10 months for a chronological age of 15 months, with a prominent occiput, 11 pairs of ribs, but no skeletal dysplasia. In her first months of life, she developed severe, diffuse eczema with alopecia. She showed a moderate global developmental delay, and her growth retardation worsened, while maintaining harmonious morphology and proportions: at 20 months, she weighed 6600g ( -4 SD; <1st percentile ), measured 68 cm ( -4. 5 SD; <1st percentile ) and had a HC of 34. 5 cm ( -10 SD; <1st percentile ). At 9 years old, HC was 39 cm ( -10. 5 SD; <1st percentile ). At 13 years old, she weighed 35. 1 kg ( -1. 5 SD; 10th percentile ) and her height was 131 cm ( -4 SD; <1st percentile ). She had a low frontotemporal hair implantation, an extremely sloping forehead, a discrete convergent strabismus, and retrognathism. Brain MRI performed at 20 months of age showed microcephaly with short but complete corpus callosum ( arrowhead, Fig 1B ), delayed myelination and supratentorial pachygyria ( red arrows, Fig 1C ). The cerebellum and brainstem were normal ( Fig 1B ). She is currently aged 17 and has a neurological follow-up for cognitive impairment and epilepsy treated with valproate, clobazam and olanzapine. Because of the clinical suspicion of TALS, Sanger sequencing of RNU4ATAC was first performed, but no variant was found. Then, whole exome sequencing was done and the homozygous variant NM_173630: RTTN c. 2953A>G was identified ( ClinVar #977819, reported as pathogenic ), in a gene that does not contain any minor intron. Interestingly, this case is not the first of its kind. When we reviewed the literature on cases harboring bi-allelic variants in RTTN, two families reported by Grandone et al. [20] and by Shamseldin et al. [19] particularly caught our attention. In the former report, the siblings, a boy and a girl, who were also homozygous for the RTTN c. 2953A>G variant, were not formally diagnosed with TALS but they presented all the typical features of it: severe growth retardation, severe microcephaly ( with lissencephaly ), eczema and developmental delay. In the latter, two siblings, negative for RNU4ATAC but having compound heterozygous missense variants in RTTN, were clinically diagnosed with MOPD1 as they were presenting severe pre- and post-natal growth delay, severe microcephaly ( with cerebellar hypoplasia, dysgenesis/agenesis of corpus callosum, lissencephaly or reduced sulcation, ventricular abnormalities ), joint contractures and the typical facial dysmorphism ( prominent eyes, sloping forehead, micrognathia ). The two baby boys died before 3 months of age. Of note, all the other RTTN published cases present with quite heterogeneous clinical presentations, distinct from the TALS phenotype ( Fig 1D and S1 Table ). Since the pathophysiological mechanisms by which damaging RTTN variants impact brain development are poorly known, we investigated RTTN c. 2953A impact on the centrosome and primary cilium in fibroblasts, RPE cells and NS derived from CRPR/C9-ed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC ). We used CRISPR/C9-edited iPSC to differentiate into NS and cortical organoids (CO ) to study the role of RT in the self-organisation of NS into neural roset. Our results show that the RT c 3. 295A variant leads to cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, aneuploidy cell arrest and cell death in fibrobl, RPE and NS ( Fig 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 23, 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 100 102 106 110 114 118 122 126 130 138 146 154 162 170 178 186 194 202 210 218 226 234 242 250 258 266 274 282 290 298 306 314 322 330 338 346 354 362 370 378 386 394 402 418 426 442 458 474 490 522 554 590 650 710 770 850 920 1010 1170 1230 1350 1530 1710 1890 2070 2250 2430 2610 2790 2970 3150 3330 3510 369 0 387 4050 423 441 459 487 523 559 599 679 759 839 919 999 1079 1159 1239 139 159 179 199 239 279 319 399 499 599 799 1099 1199 139 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 1099 1199 139 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 1099 119 139 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 1099 119 139 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 109 119 139 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 109 139 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 119 159 199 239 299 399 499 799 199 239 299 399 499 799 199 299 399 499 799 299 399 499 799 299 499 499 799 299 499 499 799 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499

    Title: 
    Article: Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species, Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion, by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ). In July 2015, we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP. In these experiments populations of E. coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media, but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment. Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments, we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation. First, we show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically, up to six years under resource exhaustion, through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations. We further show that upon entry into LTSP, long-lasting lineages are established. This lineage structure is in itself convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP, combined with the LTSP populations’ lineage structure, enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggestive of a historical contingency. We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association. Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. 
 Evolution is a historical process, in which the potential of certain adaptive events to occur, may sometimes depend on the previous occurrence of other events. Historical contingency is generally defined as the dependence of adaptation on the history of a population [1]. Such history can manifest through the chronology of experienced conditions, the order of previously acquired mutations, or both [2–4]. The role of historical contingency in determining adaptive trajectories has long been debated. Researchers have argued about whether evolution is largely deterministic, most frequently following the same paths, or whether evolution tends to be far less predictable, due in part to frequent contingencies, making it impossible to “replay life’s tape” [5, 6]. Making these arguments more confusing, the word ‘contingency’ itself is often used to imply different meanings: on the one hand a possible, but quite unlikely and thus unpredictable, future event ( e. g. planning for every contingency ), and on the other hand an event whose occurrence depends on a different event and is quite likely given that event. In this paper, the term ‘contingency’ will be used to describe mutations whose adaptive nature is significantly dependent on the previous acquisition of other adaptive mutations. One well-characterized example of historical contingency was revealed as part of Richard Lenski’s seminal long-term evolutionary experiment ( LTEE ) [7, 8]. The LTEE was initiated in 1988, when 12 independent populations of E. coli were established in glucose-limited growth media, supplemented with citrate. Since 1988, these populations have been daily diluted into fresh media, allowing for the characterization of the dynamics of adaptation of E. coli under the experiment’s conditions of limited glucose, for well over 80 thousand generations. E. coli is unable to utilize citrate for carbon under oxic conditions [8, 9]. Indeed, this inability is one of the key parameters used to distinguish E. coli from other bacterial species [10]. One, and only one of the 12 LTEE populations evolved the ability to consume citrate as a carbon source, following ~30, 000 generations. Further analyses revealed that the reason that this phenotype evolved in only a single population, following a fairly long period of time, was related to historical contingency. Specifically, the ability of E. coli to adapt to utilize citrate as a carbon source required a large number of mutations to occur in a fairly specific order, with the effect of certain mutations depending on the previous occurrence of others [8, 11–14]. Fitting with the instance of contingency identified in the LTEE, historical contingency is often framed as a factor that reduces the predictability of adaptive trajectories [3, 15, 16]. After all, if specific mutations are adaptive only in individuals carrying other specific adaptations, and if many different adaptations can initially occur, different lineages will likely adapt via divergent trajectories. Furthermore, such trajectories may become more and more divergent as additional adaptations accumulate, further reducing the ability to predict how a given population will adapt. At the same time, many evolutionary experiments reveal a strong tendency for adaptation to occur in a convergent manner [17–19]. Such convergence, or parallelism ( the terms will be used interchangeably in this paper ), means that similar adaptive patterns and events tend to happen in parallel, across independently evolving populations, implying increased predictability. It has been shown for example that independently evolving LTEE populations displayed similar trajectories when it came to the rates with which they improved their fitness ( a pattern of diminishing returns with time ) [20, 21]. Additionally, different LTEE populations often experienced similar phenotypic changes [7, 8, 20, 22, 23]. Finally, convergent mutation acquisition was also observed in the LTEE, with different populations often accumulating mutations to similar loci [8, 22, 24–26]. In July of 2015, we initiated our own long-term evolutionary experiment, designed to study E. coli adaptation under prolonged external resource exhaustion [27, 28]. E. coli and many other non-sporulating bacteria are able to survive long periods of resource exhaustion, following brief periods of growth, by entering a state of growth termed long term stationary phase ( LTSP ) [27, 29–32]. In our LTSP experiment, five populations of E. coli K12 MG1655 were established by inoculating cells into 400 ml of fresh rich media. Each population was established from an individual clone. These populations have not been provided with any external growth resources ever since and have had to survive by recycling the remains of their ancestors and brethren [27, 33]. After a day of growth these populations entered a period of rapid death, followed by entry into LTSP, at about day 11 of the experiment. Since day 11 of our experiments, we have seen a slow decline in viability with time, and populations remain viable to this day. Data from the sequencing of ~10 clones per population, from each of nine sampled time points, spanning the first three years of the experiment ( for a total of 413 sequenced clones ), have enabled us to begin characterizing the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP [28]. These analyses have revealed that during the studied time frame, LTSP populations continuously and rapidly adapt through the continuous accumulation of mutations. Such adaptation occurs in a highly convergent manner, with mutations to the same loci and often even to the exact same sites very frequently occurring across independently evolving populations. In three of the five populations we saw the emergence of mutators, that having acquired a mutation to a mismatch repair gene, substantially increased their mutation rates. Such mutators coexisted within the same populations, alongside non-mutators, for extended periods of time [28]. Here we expand on our previously available data by sequencing clones sampled up to six years into our experiment. Utilizing these data, we characterize the lineage structure of each of our five LTSP populations. We show that the lineage structure of LTSP populations is itself a convergent feature of LTSP adaptation. This lineage structure, together with the extreme convergence of adaptation under LTSP enables us to search for putative instances of historical contingency ( Fig 1 ). Results of this analysis reveal that historical contingencies appear to be very common, as we find that more than a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in a putative contingency with at least one additional convergently mutated locus. 
 Our five LTSP populations, established in July 2015 maintain their viability to this day. Fig 2A depicts viability as a function of time, as estimated by plating samples and quantifying colony forming units ( CFUs ). We previously sequenced 413 clones from 9 time points spanning the first three years of our LTSP experiments. Here, we add to these data, resulting in whole genome sequencing data of 637 clones sampled at 12 time points, spanning the first 6 years of the experiment. A full list of the sequenced clones and their obtained sequencing coverage is given in S1 Table. It is important to note that each of the five populations was established from an individual clone and that the five ancestral clones used to establish the populations were also sequenced. Therefore, mutations identified in the evolved clones, but not in their ancestors had to have happened during the experiment. A full list of these mutations is provided in S2 Table. Focusing on 392 non-mutator clones, Fig 2B depicts the number of mutations accumulated as a function of time spent under LTSP. As can be seen, mutations continue to accumulate with time, throughout the six years examined so far. Mutations accumulated under LTSP within non-mutator clones are significantly enriched for non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutations, relative neutral expectations ( dN/dS = 3. 5, P << 0. 001, according to a χ2 test ). This indicates that mutation accumulation within non-mutators is governed by positive selection [26, 34, 35]. dN/dS continues to be significantly higher than 1 for mutations occurring across all examined time points ( P << 0. 001, according to χ test ), indicating that mutations under LTSP are under positive selection. Fig 2C shows the distribution of non-syn vs synonymous mutations as a function of time. As can be seen, the proportion of non-syn mutations increases with time, while synonymous mutations remain relatively constant. This is consistent with positive selection acting on non-syn mutations [26, 34, 35]. Fig 2D shows the distribution of non-syn mutations as a function of their position in the genome. As can be seen, non-s mutations are more likely to occur in coding regions. This is consistent with positive selection acting on coding regions [26, 34 , 36]. Fig 2E shows the distribution of non-s mutations as a function of gene function. As can be seen, non-s are more likely to occur in genes involved in DNA repair and replication. This is consistent with positive acting on genes involved in these processes [26, 34, 37]. Fig 2F shows the distribution of non-s as a function of gene expression. As can be, non are more likely to occur in highly expressed genes. This is consistent with positive acting on highly expressed genes [26, 34 , 38]. Fig 2G shows the distribution of non as a function of gene ontology. As can be, non are more likely to occur in genes involved in DNA repair and replication. This consistent with acting on genes in these processes [26, 34 , 39]. Fig 2H shows the distribution of non as a function of gene. As can, non are more likely to occur in genes involved in DNA repair. This consistent with acting on genes in this process [26, 34, 40]. Fig 2I shows the distribution of non as a function. As can, non are more likely occur in genes involved in replication. This consistent with acting on genes in this process [26, 34, 41]. Fig 2J shows the distribution of non as a function. As, non are more likely occur in genes involved. This consistent with acting on genes [26,34, 42]. Fig 2K shows the distribution of non as function. As, non more likely occur in genes. consistent with acting [26,34 43]. Fig 2L shows the distribution non as function. As, more occur in genes. consistent with acting [26, 44].

    Title: 
    Article: Although originally classified as a non-coding RNA, the male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating. Interestingly, the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter, called the iab-8 lncRNA. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not. Here, we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5’ exons of the iab-8 lncRNA. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. 
 Within the cis-regulatory region controlling the expression of the two, most-posterior homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster ( abd-A and Abd-B ), two transcripts have been identified that differ only at their 5’ ends [1–3]. Both transcripts are spliced and polyadenylated but are expressed in different tissues. Originally both of these transcripts were categorized as non-coding. The longer of these two transcripts is called the iab-8 lncRNA and is expressed in the posterior central nervous system ( CNS ) [1, 4]. Loss of the iab-8 ncRNA leads to male and female sterility, largely due to the loss of a miRNA located within its intronic sequences [1] [5, 6]. A slightly shorter, second version of this transcript also exists, called male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) [2]. As its name suggests, MSA is a male-specific transcript that was found in libraries made from Drosophila male abdomen. Later, it was found that this transcript is specifically expressed in a particular cell type of the seminal fluid producing, male accessory gland ( AG ), called the secondary cells ( SCs ) [3]. MSA shares all but its first exon with the iab8 lncRNA ( See Fig 1 ). As such, it also acts as a template to create the same miRNA as the iab-8 lncRNA ( miR-iab-8 ). We have previously shown that the loss of this miRNA in the AG leads to both the abnormal development of the secondary cells and an abnormal post-mating response in females after mating [3]. Although both of these RNAs were originally classified as non-coding and have essential non-coding functionalities, we recently discovered that the MSA version of the transcript is actually protein coding [7]. Using ribosome immunoprecipitation and GFP knock-ins, we showed that the MSA transcript serves as a template for a small peptide that we call MSAmiP. Through deletion and frameshift mutations, we found that MSAmiP plays a role in regulating sperm usage in fertilized females. Interestingly, although the iab-8 transcript shares the sORF coding for MSAmiP, using GFP fusions we were never able to detect this peptide in the CNS, where iab-8 is expressed. Here, we investigate the regulation of protein translation in the iab-8 transcript. Using GFP reporter constructs in tissue culture cells and transgenic constructs in living flies, we show that the presence of upstream ATG sequences ( or upstream open reading frames—uORFs ) in the 5’ exons of iab-8 prevent downstream translation from the iab-8 transcript. Given the conservation of these uORFs in Drosophila, it is interesting to note that we can find no overt phenotypic effect on the development or behavior of the fly, when we ectopically express the MSA version of the transcript. We explore the possibility that this repressive mechanism may be a remnant of an ancient method to prevent ectopic activation of the abd-A homeotic gene. 
 S2 cell experiments were performed as in [7]. Basically, ~125 000 S2 cells were placed onto sterilized glass coverslips in 24-well plates, 24 hours prior transfection. The next day, three plasmids ( 300ng each per well ) : pActin-Gal4, pUAS-mCherry [7] and an experimental pUAS-plasmid were mixed and transfected with Cellfectin according to manufacturer’s directions. All transfections were performed in triplicate. 3 days post transfection, plates were spun and the cells were fixed onto the coverslips with 10% formaldehyde in PBS. The coverslips were then mounted on slides with Vectashield including DAPI ( Vector labs, California, USA ) and imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with 10, 20μm step stacks in the green and in the red channel using identical settings ( Green channel: HyD3 Laser: 488nm, 0. 07%, gain: 100%, Red channel: PMT2 Laser 552nm, 2%, gain: 500 ). Image quantification was performed in Fiji [8], using a macro described in [7]. Quantification was performed using multiple comparison Kruskal-Wallis test ( non-parametric ) on the PRISM software ( GraphPad, Boston, USA ). Details on the construction of each of the plasmids used in this study are presented in S1 Text. The pUASexon1&2, pUASexon1&2ΔATG, pUAS-ORF1-GFP, and pUAS-ORF2-GFP were injected at Bestgene Inc ( Chino Hills, CA, USA ) into the 68E platform [9]. Guide plasmids and pNProsyattPinPminit were co-injected in equimolar ratio ( total concentration: 300ng/μL ) in lig4 vas::Cas9;;ry506 flies. Go flies were crossed with TM2/MKRS balancer stock, and each ry+ F1 progeny was recovered and independent stocks were established from each of these flies. Single PCR was performed on each ry+ F1 fly using the 5’ryAS-PCR/YR and 3’ryS-PCR/IF primers which amplify the regions flanking the target site only if correctly inserted. Sequencing of the amplified fragment confirmed the insertion. A y1 M{vas-int. Dm}ZH-2A w*;iab8promYF/TM6 stock was first established for our injections. We injected the pexon1-ΔORF1&2, pexon1-ORF1-GFP, pexon1-ORF2-GFP, pexon1-rescue, pexon1-Gal4 plasmids in the iab8promYF line at a concentration of ( 300ng/μL ) in dechorionated embryos. Go flies were then crossed to TM2/MKRS balancer line and screened for ry- flies, marking an integration event that removes the ry+ marker. The candidate stocks homozygous fertile for the insertion were selected and the regions was PCRed and sequenced to verify fidelity and directionality of the insertions. To screen for single insertion event, we did a PCR with HR5-check/IF primers. For the PCR of the deletion and rescue constructs, we used the HR5-check/ R DON-ex1, while for the Gal4 constructs, we used the HR5-check/Gal4-RT Rev For fixation and staining of accessory glands, we used a protocol provided by Dr. Elodie Prince [10]. Wing disc, embryos and adult tissues were performed as in [11]. All samples were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI. Antibodies against ABD-A: goat polyclonal anti-ABD-A ( DH-17 ) ( Santa Cruz biotechnology ), monoclonal anti-ABD-A ( hybridoma bank ), rat anti-ABD-A [12] and Rabbit anti-ABDA [13]. Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 800 or a Nikon Ni-E confocal microscope. Genomic regions surrounding exon 1 of the iab8 ncRNA in non-melanogaster species have been identified and downloaded using NCBI’s BLAST against the genome assemblies referenced under the BioProject PRJNA675888 [14]. All ORFs longer than 50 amino-acid residues have been extracted from the genomic sequences as well as in the corresponding genomic region in Drosophila melanogaster. ORFs presenting high similarities with ORF 1 or 2 from D. melanogaster were manually picked, and aligned using the multiple sequence alignment software MUSCLE, available on the sequence analysis application SeaView5 [15] [16]. For several species ( D. biarmipes, D. teissieri, D. eugracilis, D. elegans and D. erecta ) two ORFs of interest were found highly resembling the beginning and the end of ORF 2 of D. melanogaster. For those species the nucleotide sequences covering both parts were extracted and, when necessary, one or two bases were added after the first STOP codon to reveal both ORF 1 and OR 2. The sequences were then aligned using MUS, and the alignment was visualized in SeaView. 
The results show that the ORF1 and OR2 of D melanaster are highly conserved in Drosila species, but not in other Dros species. The conservation of OR1 and OR2 in D melanaster suggests that they may play a functional role in the regulation of the i8 transcript. The conservation of OR1 and OR2 in other Dila species suggests that they may be remnant of an ancient method to prevent ectopic activation of the ab-A gene.

    Title: 
    Article: Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ). CDG typically present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay but display large clinical variability with symptoms affecting every system in the body. This variability suggests modifier genes might influence the phenotypes. Because of the similar physiology and clinical symptoms, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG. Here, we use evolution as a tool to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. Using ERC, we identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. 
 Phenotypic variation is common in Mendelian diseases, even in patients with the same disease-causing variant [1–3]. Understanding the factors underlying variable disease presentation can be difficult despite often knowing the causal disease gene. Genetic modifiers can enhance or suppress the phenotype of a primary disease-causing mutation, but they may not independently lead to disease phenotypes. Congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDG ) are a group of ultra-rare multisystemic disorders typically characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays [4, 5]. However, because of the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms of CDG can affect most organ systems. Loss-of-function mutations in 189 glycosylation genes lead to CDG [6]. Patients with the same CDG and even the same disease-causing variant can show phenotypic variability, indicating that genetic background and environment can influence clinical presentation [7, 8]. Current treatment options for CDG are limited, primarily focusing on symptom management [9, 10]. Identifying genetic modifiers of glycosylation genes could lead to new therapeutic targets for CDG patients. Protein glycosylation is essential for proper protein folding, stability, and localization [4, 5, 11]. There are three main types of glycosylation: N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor biosynthesis. N-linked glycosylation is the addition of a glycan onto an asparagine [4, 5]. The glycan is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane, with the stepwise addition of sugars onto a dolichol-phosphate. The glycan is then transferred from the dolichol-phosphate onto a protein and undergoes further glycan additions and trimming in the ER and Golgi. O-linked glycosylation is the addition of a glycan to the hydroxyl group of a serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine [4]. O-linked glycosylation encompasses the most extensive variety of glycans and can occur in the ER, Golgi, or cytoplasm [12]. O-linked glycans are classified by the first sugar attached to the protein. The rest of the glycan is built directly onto that sugar. GPI anchors are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane [8, 13]. GPI anchor synthesis begins by adding an N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) onto a phosphatidylinositol on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. The acyl group is then removed before the glycan is flipped onto the lumen side of the ER membrane. In the ER lumen, three mannoses ( four in some species/tissues ) and three phosphoethanolamine groups are added before a protein is attached to the GPI anchor. The GPI anchor then undergoes fatty acid remodeling before it is sent to the Golgi for further remodeling. Then, the GPI-anchored glycoprotein is trafficked to the cell surface. Standard methods for identifying genetic modifiers typically involve utilizing natural variation in the population or performing large mutagenesis screens [1]. Several recent studies reported modifier screens in animal models of specific CDG [14–16]. However, with over 150 CDG, performing similar studies for each CDG is impractical. PMM2-CDG, the most common CDG, has just over 1000 diagnosed patients worldwide [17]. Most CDG, however, have fewer than 100 patients, making it challenging to have enough statistical power to distinguish impactful variation within the population [8, 18]. It is likely CDG share common genetic modifiers because different forms can have similar effects on glycosylation and similar clinical presentations. Instead of examining each CDG independently, we sought to identify common modifier genes for all or a subset of CDG. To do this, we used evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ), a computational evolutionary method developed to identify proteins with evolutionary rates that covary across species [19]. Protein pairs with high ERC values have similar changes in evolutionary rate and are thought to function together, either in a complex or in a pathway, and may genetically modify each other. ERC allows us to identify proteins with evolutionary rates that covary with CDG proteins, potentially identifying genetic modifiers. A number of recent studies suggest that other glycosylation genes modify CDG genes. In 2002, a study examined a small group of PMM2-CDG patients, the most common CDG, and identified a variant in ALG6, an N-linked glycosylation gene, segregating with more severe outcomes [20]. A modifier screen and ERC analysis of NGLY1, a deglycosylating enzyme associated with a CDG, identified multiple glycosylation genes showing high ERC with NGLY1, implicating them as potential modifiers [15]. A CRISPR screen in cells with reduced DPAGT1 function, the first step in N-glycan synthesis, identified multiple glycosylation genes able to rescue glycosylation defects caused by inhibition of DPAGT1 [14]. In yet another study, a yeast model of PMM2-CDG was evolved over 1000 generations to identify genetic changes that increased the viability of the PMM2 mutant yeast strains [16]. Several top genes that accumulated compensatory mutations were also involved in glycosylation. These studies indicate that genetic variation in glycosylation genes might potentially modify the outcomes of CDG. Applying a computational evolutionary method allows for more rapid and broad detection of disease modifiers. Identifying genetic modifiers of CDG will lead to a better understanding of the physiology underlying variable symptoms in patients and could point to new therapeutic targets. Using ERC, we performed an analysis to discover proteins that have correlated evolutionary rates with glycosylation proteins to discover genetic modifiers of CDG. We found strong intra-pathway ERC signatures among glycosylation proteins in each of the three glycosylation pathways, with the highest average score in GPI anchor synthesis. There were also high inter-pathway ERC values between proteins in different glycosylation pathways. Strikingly, GPI anchor synthesis proteins had many high ERC values with N-linked glycosylation proteins. Protein complexes and proteins with similar functions in glycosylation were also enriched for strong ERC. When examining the genome for non-glycosylation modifiers of GPI anchor synthesis proteins, we found high ERC scores with proteins involved in multiple unrelated pathways, including ncRNA and DNA repair. We found that the strength of these ERC scores is driven by the GPI anchor synthesis enzyme’s location in the cell. In vivo testing of top scoring protein pairs, including GPAA1 with ALG1 and PIGA with RBSN, showed a genetic interaction in a Drosophila eye model. Using computational evolutionary methods, we identified patterns of ERC between CDG proteins and novel potential modifier proteins, many of which validated in vivo. 
 To find potential candidate genetic modifiers of CDG, we created a dataset of ERC scores across the genome. Using evolutionary rate data from yeast, nematode worms, Drosophila, vertebrates, and mammals ( S1A Fig ), we calculated ERC scores for 19, 149 proteins across the genome resulting in 180, 112, 645 pairwise ERC values ( S1B Fig ). The genome-wide dataset values range from -10. 73–19. 30, with an average of 0. 12 ± 1. 47. Higher values indicate stronger covariation of evolutionary rates. In this study, ERC values ≥ 3 are considered notably elevated because they are two standard deviations from the mean. Using this dataset, we compared ERC scores between subsets of proteins. We first examined the pairwise correlated evolutionary rates among all glycosylation proteins. We included 296 glycosylation proteins in our analyses ( 43, 660 protein pairs ), including all known CDG proteins and glycosylation proteins not yet associated with a disease ( S1 Data ). These include enzymes and support proteins involved in synthesizing and modifying glycans, enzymes required to form glycosylation building blocks, and proteins involved in glycan transfer and trimming. We found strong intra-pathway ERC among glycos proteins in each of the three glycos pathways, with the highest score in GPI anchor synthesis ( Fig 1A ). GPI anchor proteins had high ERC with N-linked glycos proteins ( Fig 1B ). We also found inter-path ERC between glycos proteins in different glycos pathways ( Fig 1C ). Strikingly, GPI anchor proteins had high ERC with O-linked glycos proteins ( Fig 1D ). These results suggest that glycos proteins in different pathways interact and modify each other. We then examined the genome for non-glycosylation of GPI anchor proteins and found high ERC with proteins in unrelated pathways, including ncRNA and DNA repair ( Fig 2 ). We found that the strength of ERC is driven by GPI anchor enzyme location in the cell ( Fig 3 ). In vivo testing top scoring pairs, including GP1 with AL1 and PA with RN showed a genetic interaction in Drosoph eye model ( Fig 4 ). We identified patterns of ERC between CD proteins and potential modifiers, many of which validated in vivo ( Fig 5 ). To find candidate modifiers of CD, we created a dataset of ERC across the genome. Using evolutionary data from yeast, nemat worms, Doph, vertebrates and mammals, we calculated ERC for 19, 149 proteins resulting in 180, 112, 645 pairwise values. Genome-wide values range from -10.73–19.30 with an average 0.12 ± 1.47. Higher values indicate stronger covari of evolutionary. In this study, values ≥3 are notable because two standard from mean. Using this dataset, we compared scores between subsets. First, we examined correlated rates among glycos proteins. We included 296 glycos proteins (43,660 pairs ) including known CD and glycos not associated with disease. We found intra-path ERC among glycos in each gly pathway with highest in anchor ( Fig 1 ). Anchor had ERC with N gly proteins ( Fig 1 ) and inter ERC between gly in gly pathways ( 1 ) Strik, anchor had ERC with O gly ( 1 ) These suggest gly interact and modify.

    Title: 
    Article: The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. As capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation, which remains to be determined. Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170, we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain, which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analyses, and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain. This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal, suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment. Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ). Therefore, HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids. These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation, but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development. 
 Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is a hepatotropic virus with a 3. 2 kb circular partially double-stranded DNA genome enclosed within an icosahedral nucleocapsid and outer envelope [1]. Following the infection of hepatocytes through the NTCP receptor and uncoating, the viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) is imported and converted to closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) in the nucleus [2]. This cccDNA serves as the template for the production of pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) and four viral mRNA transcripts, which are then translated into viral proteins [3]. Later, the HBV core ( HBc ) protein and polymerase ( Pol ) encapsidates the pgRNA to form the viral nucleocapsid, where reverse transcription and DNA synthesis occur [4, 5]. Mature nucleocapsids containing rcDNA assemble with envelope proteins into complete virions that bud from multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) [3, 6]. The process of pgRNA encapsidation has emerged as a promising target for new antiviral therapies such as HBc protein allosteric modulators ( CpAMs ) [7]. Therefore, there has been substantial interest in understanding the mechanisms utilized by the HBc and Pol to execute pgRNA encapsidation. The HBc protein, which is composed of ~183 a. a., is separated into an N-terminal domain ( NTD, residues 1–140 ) and a C-terminal domain ( CTD, residues 150–183 ) by a 10 a. a. linker sequence [8]. The HBc NTD is essential for capsid assembly in vitro [9, 10], while the HBc CTD is responsible for the encapsidation of viral pgRNA [11, 12]. The nucleic acid-binding activity of the HBc CTD is primarily attributed to positive charge from a series of four arginine-rich domains ( ARDs ) [13–16]. Previous studies have suggested that the charge balance of the HBc CTD is crucial for packaging pgRNA [15–17]. A decrease in the positive charge by Arg-to-Ala substitution in the CTD may reduce RNA packaging activity, which can however be rescued by decreasing negative charge by Ser-to-Ala substitution [18]. Interestingly, the pgRNA packaging activity of the HBc CTD can be affected by phosphorylation of the HBc CTD [16, 19, 20], which increases the negative charge of HBc. As documented, dimeric HBc and empty capsids exhibit hyperphosphorylated HBc, whereas nucleocapsids containing RNA or DNA exhibit hypophosphorylated HBc [21, 22]. Among the seven putative phosphorylation sites identified in the CTD, Ser155, Ser162, and Ser170 are considered major phosphorylation sites [23, 24]. Substitution of Ser162 or Ser170 with Ala significantly impaired viral pgRNA packaging [20, 25]. However, substitution of S-to-E/D in these major Ser residues in the CTD also significantly reduces pgRNA packaging [19]. These studies indicated that the story is complicated and cannot be accounted for simply based on the charge balance theory. It is possible that the phosphorylation of the HBc CTD is involved in the initial stage of pgRNA encapsidation, but the subsequent dephosphorylation of HBc is required for the enclosing of pgRNA into the mature capsid in the late stage of encapsidation. A putative phosphatase associated with the Pol-pgRNA complex has been proposed to perform this function. Although two phosphatases, PP2A and PP1, have been reported involved in the dephosphorylation of HBc [26, 27], it remains unclear which phosphatase is responsible for this dephosphorylation process, how it is recruited into the Pol-pgRNA complex, and how it affects pgRNA encapsidation. To address these questions, we generated an antibody ( Ab ) capable of distinguishing the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of HBc at Ser170, which allowed us to monitor the phosphorylation pattern of HBc-Ser170 during the progressive stages of pgRNA packaging. Interestingly, we discovered that a unique domain of Pol is involved in the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Through this specific domain, HBV Pol recruits a host phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 for the enclosing of pgRNA in mature capsids. Our investigation of this molecular event elucidates the mechanism underlying the HBc phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade during pgRNA encapsidation into nucleocapsids. 
 To track the phosphorylation status of the HBc CTD during viral replication and maturation, we have tried to generate Abs capable of distinguishing between the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the HBc CTD. We successfully generated a polyclonal C-S170 Ab that specifically recognizes one epitope in HBc containing non-phosphorylated Ser170 ( Fig 1A ). To confirm its specificity, we conducted an in vitro binding assay using a panel of synthetic peptides covering Ser155, Ser162, and Ser170 ( Fig 1A ). The ELISA results showed that the C-S170 Ab had the highest binding affinity for the non-phosphorylated peptide covering Ser170 ( Fig 1B ). Consistently, the dissociation constant ( Kd ) values demonstrated that C-S170 had the greatest capacity to interact with the peptide containing non-phosphorylated Ser170 ( Fig 1C ). Moreover, competition binding assays revealed that the peptide containing non-phosphorylated Ser170 had the greatest ability to compete for binding, while the presence of phosphorylated Ser170 peptide had no effect on binding ( Fig 1D and 1E ). These results strongly supported the specificity of the C-S170 Ab in recognizing the epitope containing non-phosphorylated Ser170 in HBc. In addition to experiments involving these synthetic peptides, we validated the recognition pattern of the C-S170 Ab for full-length HBc. Wild-type or mutant HBc expression constructs, including mutants with Ala and Asp substitutions at Ser155, Ser162, Ser168, Ser170, and Ser176, were transfected into Huh7 cells. Cell lysates were harvested for immunoblotting analysis using C-S170 Ab and control anti-HBc Ab ( 2A7 Ab for targeting a. a. 140–152 ). All forms of HBc, including wild-type and mutant HBc, were well recognized by 2A7 Ab ( Fig 1F ). However, only the S170A mutant was recognized by the C-S170 Ab ( Fig 1F, lane 9 ), supporting the specificity of the C-S170 Ab for recognizing epitopes containing non-phosphorylated Ser170. Moreover, the predominant form of HBc in the cells was phosphorylated at Ser170, as indicated by the lack of a detectable signal of C-S170 Ab ( Fig 1F, lane 2 ). To further verify this finding, lysates from CMV-HBc transfected cells and bacteria-expressed recombinant HBc ( reHBc ) were treated with alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) for immunoblotting analysis. Only AP-treated CMV-HBc showed an increase in the C-S170 Ab recognition signal ( Fig 1, lane 3 ), indicating dephosphorylation of HB-S170 in CM-HB. In contrast, AP-treated HB showed no change in the C-S Ab signal ( Fig 1, lane 4 ), suggesting that HB is not dephosphorylated at Ser170. These results demonstrate that the C-S Ab is specific for nonosphorylated HB-Ser170 and that HB is phosphorylated at Ser170 in CMV-infected cells. To monitor the phosphorylation of HB-S170 during pgRNA encapsation, we transfected Huh cells with CMV-HB and harvested cells at different time points postinfection. Lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using C170 and 2 Ab ( Fig 2A ). Initially, phosphorylated HB was detected by 2 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 1 ) but not C170 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 1 ). However, at 2 h postinfection, phosphorylated HB was detected by both 2 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 2 ) and C170 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 2 ). At 4 h postinfection, phosphorylated HB was detected by 2 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 3 ) but not C170 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 3 ). At 6 h postinfection, phosphorylated was detected by 2 Ab ( Fig 2, lane 4 ) but not C170 ( Fig 2, lane 4 ). At 8 h postinfection, phosphorylated was detected by 2 ( Fig 2, lane 5 ) and C170 ( Fig 2, lane 5 ). At 10 postin, phosphorylated was detected by 2 ( Fig 2, lane 6 ) and C170 ( Fig 2, lane 6 ). At 12 postin, phosphorylated was detected by 2 ( Fig 2, lane 7 ) and C170 ( Fig 2, lane 7 ). At 14 post, phosphorylated was detected by 2 ( Fig 2, lane 8 ) and C170 ( Fig 2, lane 8 ). At 16 post, phosphorylated was detected 2 ( Fig 2, lane 9 ) and C170 ( Fig 2, lane 9 ). At 18 post, phosphory was detected 2 ( Fig 2, lane 10 ) and C170 ( Fig 2, lane 10 ). At 20 post, phosphory was detected 2 ( Fig 2, lane 11 ) and170 ( Fig 2, lane 11 ). At 22 post, phosphory was detected 2 ( Fig 2, lane 12 ) and170 ( Fig 2, lane 12 ) At 24 post, phosphory was 2 ( Fig 2, lane 13 ) and170 ( Fig 2, 13 ) At 26 post, phosphory was 2 ( Fig 2, 14 ) and170 ( 2, lane 14 ) At 28 post, phosphory was 2 ( Fig 2, 15 ) and170 ( 2, 15 ) At 30 post, phosphory was 2 ( 2, 16 ) and170 ( 2, 16 ) At 32 post, phosphory was 2 ( 2 17 ) and170 ( 2 17 ) At 34 post, phosphory was 2 ( 18 ) and170 ( 18 ) At 36, phosphory was 2 ( 19 ) and170 ( 19 ) At 38, phosphory 2 ( 20 ) and170 (20 ) At 40, phosphory 2 (21 ) and (21 ) At 42, phosphory 2 (22 ) and (22 ) At 44, phosphory 2

    Title: 
    Article: Bacterial symbionts, with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ), play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean, offering a “natural experiment” for studying how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change. However, the role of bacterial symbionts in this process is often overlooked. We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus, to investigate how differing environmental conditions have influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. Interestingly, this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through HGT from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. It highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions. 
 Global change gives rise to new environmental conditions and niches that organisms can adapt to and exploit, and the extent and mechanisms of adaptation in marine species may be significantly influenced by their microbiomes [1]. Bacterial symbionts of animals can potentially adapt to changing environments more rapidly and more flexibly than their hosts due to traits such as shorter generation times, enhanced recombination capabilities, and the potential for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) between distantly-related organisms [2]. In addition, horizontally acquired bacterial symbionts—those obtained from the environment in each generation—have access to a larger genetic pool for genetic exchange during their free-living phase, which can lead to faster adaptive responses [3]. Consequently, symbionts can serve as a source of ecological innovation, enabling the symbiosis to tap into novel resources and adapt to novel habitats [4–6]. Understanding the mechanisms enabling microbial symbionts to adapt to new environmental conditions will provide novel insights into how animal-microbe symbioses respond to changing environments. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama about 2. 8 million years ago had a profound impact on oceanic conditions, altering environmental factors such as ocean currents, salinity, temperature, and nutrient availability on both sides of the Isthmus [7]. The Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) continued to experience regular nutrient input due to seasonal upwelling, coupled with increased primary productivity, variable temperatures, and strong tides [7]. In contrast, the Caribbean coast became characterized by stable and warmer temperatures, higher salinity, and a notably low availability of organic nutrients [7]. Animal populations that were once connected became separated by the closure of the Isthmus, ultimately resulting in the emergence of sister species on separate evolutionary trajectories, diverging in response to the markedly different environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus [8]. The adaptation strategies enabling these sister species to thrive in their respective, contrasting environments have been extensively studied, but these studies have primarily focused on the animals themselves, largely overlooking the potential influence of host-associated microorganisms ( reviewed in [1, 8, 9] ). The Isthmus of Panama presents a unique opportunity to investigate the drivers of diversification and adaptation through a "natural experiment” running for millions of years with a taxonomically replicated set of animal-microbe assemblages [10]. This offers valuable insights into the interplay between hosts and their microbial symbionts in the context of environmental change. The Lucinidae, one of the most species-rich bivalve families, thrive in a wide array of marine environments and is the most diverse group of chemosymbiotic animals [11]. Lucinids house endosymbiotic sulfide-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria intracellularly within specialized gill cells, where they use the energy derived from oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds to synthesize organic carbon [11–13]. This partnership is obligate for lucinids because they rely on their symbionts for a significant portion of their carbon nutritional requirements [14, 15]. The bacterial symbionts are acquired from free-living populations in the environment during the early developmental stages of each new generation [16, 17]. Recent studies have begun to unveil the metabolic and genomic diversity among symbionts from vastly different environments across the globe, including differences in their abilities to metabolize carbon and inorganic nitrogen [18–20]. Notably, some symbiont clades of the genus Ca. Thiodiazotropha were the first documented example of nitrogen-fixing chemosynthetic symbionts [21, 22]. However, the precise processes governing the diversification and adaptation of lucinid symbionts to changing environmental parameters, which may lead to the divergence of local populations of globally distributed taxa, remains poorly understood. Sister species of lucinids from the genera Codakia and Ctena have diverged on either side of the Isthmus of Panama [1, 11]. This unique relationship allows for a comparative study of symbiont adaptation, free from the confounding effects of host evolutionary history. We used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to recover metagenome-assembled genomes ( MAGs ) of bacterial symbionts associated with Codakia and Ctena sister species from both sides of the Isthmus of Panama. Our primary objective was to investigate how differing environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus have influenced the selection, diversity, and functional traits of symbionts associated with lucinid clams. We found that all lucinid symbionts from the Caribbean had the potential to fix nitrogen and assimilate nitrate, but these functions were absent in all symbionts from the TEP. To further explore the evolutionary origins of nitrogen fixation in different lucinid symbiont lineages, we compared the genomes of symbionts across the Isthmus of Panama with other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world. Using phylogenetic reconciliation, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon and identified two distinct HGT events that led to nif gene acquisition and correlated with the colonization of nutrient-poor environments. Within the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida clade, populations in nutrient-poor environments possessed nitrogen fixation genes, whereas those closely related populations in nutrient-rich environments did not. Despite their high Average Nucleotide Identity ( ANI; >95% ) and evidence of homologous recombination between geographically distant populations, our findings indicate that these Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida populations have diverged ecologically and occupy separate niches that differ in nitrogen availability. We hypothesize that the diversification of these symbionts was facilitated by the acquisition of the nitrogen fixation genes through HGT. Our results provide valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between environmental factors and genetic exchange that shape the ecology, evolution, and diversification of host-associated microorganisms. 
 To investigate whether homologous recombination might play a role in maintaining the genetic connectivity of the Ca. T. endolucinda populations from different geographic locations, we measured the relative rates of recombination to mutation events from core genome alignments of all the Ca. T. endolucinda lineages. The R/θ of the Ca. T. endolucinda core genome—a 2, 710, 509 base pairs ( bp ) alignment—was 0. 0999 while the r/m ratio was 0. 589 ( Table 2 ), which is significantly higher than the value previously measured for this species ( 0. 082 ) [19]. This notable difference could be explained by a lack of resolution in the data, as Osvatic and colleagues analyzed Ca. T. endolucinda MAGs from a single site ( Bocas del Toro, Panama ) [19]. Furthermore, we explored how these rates of homologous recombination compared with those observed in Ca. T. gloverae, a globally-distributed symbiont inhabiting deep-water or temperate environments, as well as the rates previously reported for Ca. T. taylori, a symbiont found in tropical oligotrophic shallow-water environments around the world [18, 19]. The R/θ of the Ca.

    Title: 
    Article: TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention, leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors. However, the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored. Here, we identify 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes. Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content, in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages. In most species, TAS2R genes are found in clusters; compared to other vertebrates, amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics. 
 The ability of vertebrates to detect the five cardinal tastes—sweet, umami, salty, sour, and bitter—plays a pivotal role in regulating myriad aspects of animal physiology and behavior. Whereas sweet, umami, and mildly salty are generally considered to be attractive stimuli, guiding animals towards nutrient-rich foods, bitter and sour are considered aversive, and are believed to guide animals away from noxious substances, such as toxins or metabolites found in spoiled food [1]. Each taste is generally associated with a suite of related receptors [2]. Bitterness, as perceived by humans, is detected by a family of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) called TAS2Rs or T2Rs, encoded by compact, intronless genes. Previous studies have shown that vertebrates have a wide repertoire of TAS2Rs, which varies considerably across lineages, from zero in cetaceans to over two hundred in frogs [3–5]. Detailed evolutionary, expression, and functional studies have been performed in a variety of species, with a bias towards rodents and primates. TAS2R genes appear to be under relatively rapid birth and death evolution in many vertebrate lineages, with significant differences even between close relatives like rats and mice [6] or humans and other primates [6, 7]. In humans and mice, the majority of TAS2Rs are in two or three gene clusters ( 0. 7–30 MB each, containing 10–29 receptors ) in the genome with one or two additional singleton genes per genome [8]. There is considerable variation in the presence or absence of distinct TAS2R family members within species, with evidence of rapid pseudogenization and whole gene deletion in chimpanzees [9]. Over the last two decades, ligands have been identified for a wide range of receptors, including humans and mice [10–12], primates [13–17], domestic cats [18], domestic dogs [19], bats [20–23], marsupials and monotremes [24], birds [25, 26], fish [27, 28], and frogs [3, 25]. These studies have shown that some receptors are highly specific, with only one or two known ligands, whereas others respond to a broader suite of chemicals and are considered promiscuous. Many toxic plant secondary metabolites activate one or more human receptors, consistent with bitterness as an oral “early warning” system for foods that may be harmful [29]. However, several recent studies have reported expression of TAS2Rs and other taste pathway proteins in extra-oral tissues like the intestines, brain, airways, and testes. Interruption of these pathways in mice results in reduced parasitic worm clearance [30], altered secretion of the hunger hormone ghrelin [31], and impaired spermatogenesis [32], suggesting extra-oral functions. TAS2Rs are also expressed in mouse adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver [33], although less is known about their function in these tissues. There have only been a handful of studies of extra-oral TAS2Rs in non-mammalian species including trout, cave fish, and chickens. These studies each characterized the expression patterns of a subset of receptors encoded by the genome in a few tissues of interest, and assayed the response of these receptors to classic human bitterants or common feed ingredients [34–36]. Despite evidence that amphibians have an incredible diversity of TAS2Rs, with current literature values ranging from 3 or 4 in Gaboon caecilians ( Geotrypetes seraphini ) to almost 250 in Japanese wrinkled frogs ( Glandirana rugosa ) [4, 5, 27], the full scope and underlying mechanisms of the massive expansion of TAS2R genes in amphibians, and the sensory and ecological functions of these receptors remain largely unknown. It has been proposed that their diversity may be partly due to the vastly different trophic niches inhabited by tadpoles and adults [4]. Tadpoles display a variety of dietary habits, with most species feeding on plant matter and detritus, while virtually all species of frogs are strictly carnivorous post-metamorphosis [37, 38]. Concordantly, Hao et al. found distinct TAS2R expression profiles in the mouth tissue of tadpole and adult American bullfrogs ( Rana catesbeiana, also known as Lithobates catesbeianus or Aquarana catesbeiana ), and showed that many of these receptors are capable of responding to classic human bitterants [3]. However, most non-anuran amphibians ( salamanders and caecilians ) are generalist predators throughout their life [39], and amphibians interact with bitter compounds in a variety of ecological contexts beyond aversive taste, suggesting that trophic differences across life stages are not the only factor influencing the evolution and diversification of the TAS2R family. For instance, multiple species across the amphibian phylogeny rely on potentially bitter chemicals, such as alkaloids [40] and cardiac glycosides [41, 42], for defense against predators and parasites. In many cases, these chemicals are acquired from prey [43, 44] or commensal microbes [45], suggesting that their detection is a key part of chemical defense. Furthermore, as aquatic/semiaquatic species, the ability to detect bitter chemicals in water may play an important role in both behavioral and physiological contexts, such as the selection of microhabitats or egg-laying substrates. Given this, there are many situations in which TAS2Rs expressed in extra-oral tissues can be involved, but the potential physiological function of extra-oral TAS2Rs is poorly understood in amphibians due to the lack of comprehensive expression maps for these extra-oral TAS2Rs. In this study, we performed genome-wide comparative analyses of 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 high-quality vertebrate genomes in order to gain insights into the unique evolutionary trajectories and dynamics of the TAS2R gene family in amphibians. We then evaluated functional aspects of TAS2R expansion in amphibians through gene expression analyses of seven tissues across five amphibian species spanning broad evolutionary and ecological diversity. Using in vitro receptor functional assays, we assessed ligand profiles of select TAS2Rs against a collection of biologically relevant natural products. The comprehensive findings from this research suggest a distinctive role for TAS2Rs in amphibian ecology and evolution. 
 The advent of advanced sequencing technologies and the surge in high-quality genome sequences throughout the animal kingdom in recent years have opened new avenues for taxonomically broad genome mining for diverse gene families, such as TAS2Rs. We developed a computational pipeline to identify bitter taste receptors in any unannotated genome, and used it to analyze chromosome-level assemblies from 661 vertebrate species, identifying 9, 291 intact TAS2Rs. The number of genes per species ranged from 0 in jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, and cetaceans, to 248 in the wood frog ( Lithobates sylvaticus ) ( Fig 1A and 1B ). This result is generally consistent with a recent comprehensive evolutionary study of vertebrate chemoreceptor genes [5] despite some differences, such as missing cartilaginous fish receptors in our analysis ( S1 Fig ). We constructed a phylogenetic gene tree by maximum-likelihood containing the 9, 291 TAS2Rs found in our chosen species ( Fig 1D ). We noticed that TAS2Rs diverged extensively after the major vertebrate lineages were established. Most amphibian receptors are found in four major groups ( clade M1-M4 ). Several receptors form small groups in the gene tree ( clade m1- m4 ). All the major clades have receptors from frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, whereas caecilian receptors are relatively accumulated in the clade M4. The minor “clade m1” containing a small number of salamander and caecilian receptors are clustered with lungfish receptors ( approximate bayes > 0. 95 ) and close to actinopteri receptors ( 0. 95 > aBayes > 0. 90 ). We do find that bird and reptile ( Sauropsida ) receptors are relatively distributed, with some in clade M1 and clade M3 and others in clade M and clade 4. Mammalian TASRs are in clade 1 and clade 2. The phylogenetic tree shows that vertebrate TASRs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TASR count is stable in most lineages ( Fig 1E ). This is consistent with previous studies of vertebrate chemoreceptors [5]. We also found that TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues ( Fig 1F ). This suggests that TASRs in extraoral may be more conserved across vertebrates than previously thought. In contrast, TASR count is not proportional in oral tissues ( Fig 1G ). This is consistent with previous studies showing that TASRs in oral are rapidly evolving [6, 7]. We also found that TASRs are found in clusters in most vertebrates, but amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster ( Fig 1H ). This is consistent with previous studies of vertebrate chemoreceptors [5]. We evaluated the expression of TASRs in seven tissues across five amphibian species spanning broad evolutionary and ecological diversity ( Fig 2 and 3 ). We found that TASRs are expressed in a variety of extraoral tissues, including intestines, brain, airways, testes, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver ( Fig 2 and 3 ). This is consistent with previous studies in mammals [33] and non-mammals [34–36]. We assayed the response of TASRs to a collection of biologically relevant products in vitro ( Fig 4 and 5 ) and found that many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics. This is consistent with previous studies in mammals [10–12] and non-mamm [34–36]. We also found that TASRs in amphibians are highly promiscuous, responding to a wide range of chemicals ( Fig 4 and 5 ). This is consistent with previous studies in mammals [10–12] and nonamm [34–36]. Overall, our results suggest that TASRs in amphibians play a key role in detecting ecologically important chemicals in a variety of contexts beyond aversive taste. This is consistent with previous studies in mammals [10–12] and nonamm [34–36]. We also found that TASRs in amphibians are involved in defense against predators and parasites ( Fig 4 and 5 ). This is consistent with previous studies in mammals [30–32] and nonamm [34]. Overall, our results suggest that TASRs in amphib play a key role in detecting ecologically important chemicals in a variety contexts beyond aversive. This is consistent with previous studies in mammals [10–12] and nonamm [34]. We also found that TASRs in amphibians are involved in defense against predators and parasites ( Fig 4 and 5 ). This is consistent with studies in mammals [30–32] and nonamm [34]. Overall, our results suggest that TASRs in amphib play a key role detecting ecologically important chemicals in variety contexts beyond aversive. This consistent with studies in mammals [10–12] and nonamm [34]. We found that TASRs amphibians are involved in defense against predators and parasites ( Fig 4 and 5 ).

    Title: 
    Article: A tri-protein complex containing NICD, RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription. Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation, confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro, and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome, with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity. To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. 
 The canonical Notch signaling pathway allows adjacent cells to communicate via ligands and receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Mammals express four Notch receptors ( Notch1 ( N1 ), N2, N3 and N4 ) and 5 ligands ( Delta-like1 ( Dll1 ), Dll3, Dll4, Jagged1 ( Jag1 ) and Jag2 ). Ligand binding to a receptor unfolds a negative regulatory domain to activate a series of consecutive proteolytic cleavages releasing the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ). The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms the Notch transcription complex ( NTC ) together with the co-factors RBPj/CSL ( Recombinant binding protein for immunoglobulin J Kappa; CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1 ) and MAML ( Mastermind-like ) family members. In the absence of NICD, CSL associates with co-repressors SPEN ( Split Ends homologue, also called MINT ( MSX2 interacting nuclear target ) or SHARP ( SMRT/HDAC1 associated Repressor Protein ) ), NCOR1 ( nuclear receptor corepressor1 ), NCOR2 ( also called SMART ) and others, maintaining transcription in the off-state [1, 2]. In the nucleus, the NTCs bind to DNA to regulate target gene expression [3–7]. Binding to the DNA occurs on conserved CSL sites. NICDs can form NTC homo- or hetero-dimers on sequence-paired-sites ( SPS ) which consists of two CSL sites organized in head-to-head orientation 15–18 nucleotides apart [8–13]. To investigate the biological function of NTC dimers we generated mice with ARG to ALA substitutions at the dimer interface in both Notch1 and Notch2 to block dimerization ( N1R1974A and N2R1934A, henceforth N1RA or N2RA or NDD when both are mutated in the same genome ). These mice showed defects in multiple organs, including spleen, heart and the intestine [14]. They proved to be hypersensitive to environmental conditions, with hypo-allergenic environment ameliorating many of the more severe phenotypes ( further analyzed in separate study—[15] ). The mammalian intestine, divided into the small intestine and the large intestine or colon, consists of the inner layer of consistently renewing epithelial cells, or intestinal mucosa, surrounded by an outer, innervated smooth muscle layer responsible for peristaltic movement. The epithelium contains adsorptive cells ( enterocytes ) as well as sensory ( tuft cells ) and secretory cells ( mucus-secreting goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells ). Intestinal stem cells ( ISC ) reside at the bottom of the crypts [16, 17], marked by the expression of leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5 ), achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 ( Ascl2 ) and olfactomedin 4 ( Olfm4 ) [18–21]. Notch signaling maintains the stem cell niche and regulates differentiation of intestinal stem cells [22–24]. Blocking Notch signaling leads to loss of the stem cell niche and to goblet cell metaplasia [22, 23, 25–27]. Consistently, Notch activation expends the stem cell niche at the expense of goblet and enteroendocrine cells [24]. Notch dimerization-deficient ( NDD ) mice show an environmentally modulated susceptibility to DSS and a decrease in colonic stem cells [14], but the mechanism linking Notch dimerization with the stem cell niche remains unknown. In this study we used our NDD mouse model to further investigate the role of NTC dimerization in intestinal and colonic stem cells. To that end we examined the small intestine in vivo, as well as colonic and small intestinal spheroids ex vivo, to analyze maintenance, differentiation, and proliferation with or without input from the immune system. RNA sequencing of colonic spheroids confirmed a decrease in undifferentiated stem cells and enhanced differentiation accompanied by elevated innate immune response to symbionts but did not show any miss-regulation of dimer-dependent target genes. To identify changes in dimer vs monomer Notch interactome we performed TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29. The constitutively active TurboID-fused Notch2 and its Notch2RA counterpart constructs expressed at similar levels and biotinylated the NTC and other known partners. Notably, Notch2RA labeling of endogenous human NOTCH2 was significantly reduced relative to control, as expected in the absence of dimerization. Qualitatively, the interactome was unchanged; on average, however, quantitative analysis revealed a 33%-39% labeling reduction across all interacting partners, consistent with weak ( hypomorphic ) activity of N2RA. Interestingly, the HDAC2-anchored interactome was significantly less affected by loss of dimerization. We hypothesized that dimer-deficiency and loss of cooperativity altered the balance between transcription machinery interactions vs. the dimer independent negative regulatory/deacetylase complex, somehow sensitizing the animal to environment-mediated insults, and perhaps regulating the level of protein acetylation among interacting partners in a dimer independent fashion which might explain the relatively mild phenotype in the absence of microbiome [14]. To test the assumption that HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes we used the broad acting HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could block the intestinal consequences of NDD as well as gamma secretase inhibitor treatment ( DBZ or DAPT ) in mice and spheroids, respectively, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. 
 In a previous study we reported that N1RA/RA; N2RA/RA ( NDD ) mice loose colonic stem cells when challenged with 1% DSS, a dose that is well tolerated by wild type controls [14]. To test if loss of Notch dimerization affects colonic stem cells via a cell-autonomous mechanism, we established colon spheroid cultures devoid of immune system components and passaged them in vitro. We observed that NDD cells generated the fewest number of spheroids ( average of 2–3 per field ), N1+/+; N2RA/RA cells generated an intermediate number ( ~6/field ) and N1+/+; N2+/+ ( control ) cells generated the most ( ~15 per field; Fig 1A and 1B ). To assess the fraction of stem cells in colon spheroids, we performed qPCR analyses of Lgr5 levels on mRNA collected from three individual experiments of passage 1 spheroids. This assay confirmed that NDD spheroids had fewer Lgr5+ cells compared to wild type controls ( Fig 1C ). Accordingly, dissociating the spheroids into cell suspension and embedding the same number of cells in Matrigel ( passage 2 ) again showed fewer spheroids derived from NDD, more from N1+/+; N2RA/RA cells but still fewer than control ( Fig 1D ). We quantified cell numbers instead of spheroid count in passage 1 and 2 to illustrate the deficiency of self-renewal in colonic stem cells lacking a full complement of dimerization-competent Notch receptors ( Fig 1E ). Consistently, baseline in vivo Lgr5 expression is reduced in the distal colon of NDD mice compared to controls and was further reduced after treatment with 1% DSS ( S1A Fig ). Orthogonal support for stem cell stress was provided by analyzing N1RA/RA; N2RA/RA; Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 mice, where Notch dimer-deficient stem cells were selectively ablated by tamoxifen ( Fig 2A ). These mice showed reduced L5+ cells in the distal colon compared to controls ( Fig 2B ) and were more susceptible to 1% DSS ( Fig 2C ). We conclude that Notch dimer is required for stem maintenance of colonic stem cells in vitro and in vivo and that loss of dimer sensitizes stem cells to environmental insults. To investigate the role of HDAC activity in Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, we used the HDAC inhibitor Valpro acid ( VPA ) and found it could block the intestinal consequences of NDD as well as gamma secretase inhibitor treatment in mice spher, suggesting synergy between HD activity and proifferent program in intestinal stem cells.

    Title: 
    Article: Background selection, by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, influences patterns of total neutral diversity, πT, and genetic differentiation, FST, in structured populations. The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another, leading to selective interference. Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST, but this has not been fully explained. Here, we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. Using simulations, we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. Moreover, we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations, and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans. 
 Zeng and Corcoran [36] suggested that the effects of FST in an island model would be predictable from modifying the effective size of a subpopulation, Nlocal, by multiplying times B, the Ne/N ratio created by background selection. We show here that migration lessens the effects of background selection on the amount of genetic differentiation caused by local drift relative to predictions of B based on earlier work ( e. g. Ref [4] ). Then, we derive the expected FST in an island model with background selection and a finite number of demes, when migration follows genetic drift. In this section, we extend the quantitative genetic approach to modeling background selection, following the framework of Santiago and Caballero [24–26] and Buffalo and Kern [11], to account for how migration influences the effects of background selection, B, in an island model consisting of diploid individuals. In brief, these models consider how the additive genetic fitness variance experienced by a neutral allele due to its associations with deleterious alleles further increase its variance in reproductive success, therefore reducing its effective population size beyond that of a mutation-drift model. Given that this additional increase in the variance of reproductive success of neutral alleles is due to selection at linked sites, this has been termed the fitness-effective population size, Nf [11]. First, we describe the framework under panmixia; then, we extend it to predict the geographically local effects of background selection in an island model, Blocal ( where Blocal = Nf, localNlocal ), by deriving its local fitness-effective population size Nf, local. [24, 45]. In a panmictic population, Santiago & Caballero [25–26] suggest that, in order to understand the effects of background selection on Nf at a neutral allele, we must consider both the magnitude of additive genetic fitness variance created by associated deleterious alleles, VA, as well as the cumulative effects of this variance on the reproductive success of a neutral allele over time, estimated by the linkage inflation factor Q2. The product of these two, VAQ2, therefore represents the total variance in reproductive success over time experienced by a neutral allele due to the effects of purifying selection at linked sites. This is summarized by the following equation: Nf=N1+VAQ2 Assuming a multiplicative polygenic basis to fitness, we can approximate Nf at a neutral site linked to S regions under selection as Nf ≈ N exp ( −∑i=1SVA, iQi22 ). Here, we follow Buffalo and Kern [11] and ignore short-lived associations of neutral sites with sites on homologous chromosomes, hence the division by 2. For our derivation, we now consider an island model with d subpopulations, each with Nlocal diploid individuals. Deleterious mutations appear at site i with per-base pair mutation rate μi and heterozygous selection coefficient ti. Recombination between the focal neutral site and deleterious allele i occurs at rate ri. In order to predict the effects of background selection on FST in an island model, we now consider the effects of background selection on the fitness-effective population size of each geographically local subpopulation, Nf, local. First, we will solve for Qi2, the linkage inflation factor. Qi2 captures the cross-generational associations between a focal neutral site and deleterious site i within a focal subpopulation. For now, we will consider the case of strong selection; the estimation of Qi2 is later extended to address weak selection. The magnitude of Qi2 is contingent on the heterozygous selection coefficient of the deleterious allele, ti, and the recombination rate between the neutral and deleterious allele, ri. This is intuitive, as we expect the association between a neutral and deleterious allele within a focal subpopulation to be ended if the individual is selected out of the population or if the neutral allele recombines off of the background of the deleterious allele. Here, we account for the fact that the association between a neutral and deleterious allele also ends within a focal subpopulation if the individual carrying the haplotype emigrates out of the subpopulation, which will occur with rate m. Thus, the autocorrelation function for a neutral allele associated with deleterious allele i over time is C ( τ ) =[ ( 1−ri ) ( 1−ti ) ( 1−m ) ]τ, where τ is the number of generations. In order to estimate the net effect of this autocorrelation, Q∞, i2, we sum its effects over time: Q∞, i2=[∑τ=0∞C ( τ ) ]2=[11− ( 1−ri ) ( 1−ti ) ( 1−m ) ]2. Next, we turn to solving VA, i, the additive genetic variance contributed by deleterious alleles in segment i. Here, we simply follow the results of Buffalo and Kern [11], who show that VA, i is well approximated in a region of Li selected sites each with heterozygous selection coefficient ti and mutation rate μi under mutation-selection balance to be VA, i≈Uit, where Ui = 2Liμi is the total mutation rate in the segment. Thus, for S selected segments, we get the following equation for Nf, local: Nf, local≈Nlocalexp[−∑i=1SμiLi ( 1− ( 1−ri ) ( 1−ti ) ( 1−m ) ) 2]. As pointed out by previous work, classic background selection theory assuming mutation-selection balance only serves as a reasonable approximation under strong selection and/or weak mutation ( see ref. [23] ). When alleles are weakly deleterious, we expect genetic drift to substantially affect their frequency dynamics such that they are no longer well predicted by classic mutation-selection balance theory. Santiago and Caballero [25–26] demonstrated that Nf can be well approximated under weak selection by considering that some fraction of weakly deleterious alleles fix due to genetic drift, thus no longer contributing to the additive genetic variance, VA, experienced by linked neutral alleles. Under this weak selection regime in diploids, where deleterious alleles have a non-trivial rate of fixation, VA may be approximated as VA = ( U−2R ) t [11], where R is the rate of fixation of deleterious alleles ( the factor of two is due to our modeling of diploids ). R is estimated by considering the probability of fixation of deleterious alleles [46], pfix, as well as their rate of introduction to the population, NU, the product of the population size and diploid genomic deleterious mutation rate. Thus, we get the following system of non-linear equations, which can be numerically solved for Nf, local and R: Nf, local=NlocalBlocal≈Nlocalexp[−∑i=1S ( U−2R ) tQi22] ( 2 ) Rlocal=4Nf, localUte4Nf, localt−1. ( 3 ) Under weak selection, we must also modify Q2 to account for the loss of additive genetic variance [11, 26]. Under the strong selection regime, it was assumed that the rate of decay in association between a focal neutral allele and linked deleterious alleles due to reductions in fitness variance from selection was equal to the heterozygous selection coefficient t. This is derived by considering that the factor estimating the decay in fitness variance due to selection, Z, is estimated as Z=1−VMVA, where VM is the mutational variance. A more in-depth explanation is provided in the supplemental materials of Buffalo and Kern [11]. Briefly, Buffalo and Kern [11] demonstrate that VM≈Ut2 and VA = ( U−2R ) t. In the case of strong selection, Z=1−U 2t. However, under weak selection, the rate of decay in association between a neutral and deleter allele due to loss of fitness variance is not equal to the heterozygous coefficient t, but rather the rate of fixation of deleter alleles, R. This is because weakly deleter alleles have a non-trivial rate of fixation and contribute to the additive variance VA experienced by neutral alleles. Therefore, under weak selection, the linkage factor Q2 is approximated as Q2≈1− (1−R ) 2, where R is the rate of fixation of deleter alleles. We solve the system of non-linear equations for Nf local and R under weak selection as follows: N, local=NlocalBlocal≈Nlocalexp−∑i=1 (−Ri2 )Qi2 ( ) 2 R=4NlocalflocalU4flocal−local−1 (4)

    Title: 
    Article: Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. 
 With the surge of genomic data generated by Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) [1–4], number of available genomes have surpassed millions. These data provides opportunities to map genetic factors underlying complex diseases and phenotype. Arguably, Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) are the most popular methods for uncovering the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation [5–7]. State of the art GWAS tools rely employ mixed modeling to assess the statistical significance between variant genotypes and phenotypes while accounting for the biases in ancestry and cryptic relatedness [8–11]. Among these methods, linear mixed models ( LMMs ) have been popularly used for analyzing continuous traits, their intrinsic assumptions ( uniform distribution of residuals with respect to variant allele frequency ) may bias analyses of the binary traits. For these cases, generalized linear mixed models have been shown to provide unbiased results [12]. Although statistical modeling has advanced in recent years, the real utility of data can be only realized when large sample sizes and more diverse populations are available to identify salient genetic variants. However, it is challenging to build centralized repositories of large datasets mainly due to privacy concerns and data usage agreements [13]. Numerous studies demonstrated that genetic data is very identifying of its owner and their families [14–20]. Due to very high dimensional nature of genomic data ( i. e., very large number of variants ), sharing even summary statistics, and other related intermediate data, or simply the existence of variants ( e. g., beacons [21–23] ) can create risks of membership inference [24], i. e., whether an individual with known genotypes participated a study. These studies have led to an increased public proclivity against sharing genomic data, related intermediate statistics, and an increased protection of GWAS datasets. Although these restrictions have been partially relieved by NIH in 2018 [25–28], open sharing of raw genotype-phenotype data is still not allowed. In parallel, sharing of data from underserved, historically isolated, and vulnerable populations ( Ashkenazi Jewish community, Havasupai Tribe ) is challenging since these populations are more vulnerable for stigmatization and further isolation [29–31]. Due to these concerns, the genetic and biomedical data analysis and research is even more challenging among these communities [32]. Further concerns are related to unauthorized usage of genetic data for solving cold cases [33], usage of genomic data for probing and potential risk of diverting genealogy databases [34]. With the increasing concerns about misusing genome data, regulations like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) have been proposed and implemented to protect individual health records including genetic data [35]. The privacy concerns make it untenable to perform, high-powered and high-quality GWAS because these studies require very large sample sizes [36–38]. As a result, genome data repositories such as UK Biobank [3] often release data with strong restrictions on how data can be used with no possibilities of sharing. Besides the limited data accessibility, many more healthcare data are siloed and underutilized due to concerns around privacy. Some initiatives must be taken to connect these distributed data islands and fully use them while protecting privacy. Federated Learning ( FL ) is a method to bridge isolated data silos without sharing the actual data. Such a property can help comply with the local privacy regulations to provide means to perform collaborative GWAS across data silos. Although some related research has been proposed to provide secure GWAS, most of them focus on adopting federated methods in χ2 statistics test [37, 39], Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) [40–42], and linear/logistic regression tests [39, 41]. Among these approaches, there is currently a lack of focus on correcting the confounding by random polygenic effects while performing association testing, mainly due to computational complexity. The polygenic effects stem mainly from clustering or correlations between the input subjects. The most well-known case scenario is the existence of known and unknown family members in the case or control cohorts. Since family members share DNA segments among each other, the participation of related individuals into GWAS may shift the allele frequencies and create a confounding bias resulting in false positive signals. In addition, these members are expected to have correlated phenotypes when the studied phenotypes are highly polygenic. It has been shown in previous studies that the [43, 44] that unknown or cryptic relatedness may cause noticeable biases and must be corrected in GWAS. The most popular approach for correcting the confounding by kinship is to introduce an additive polygenic term that is distributed as a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian whose covariance matrix is proportional to the genetic relatedness matrix ( or kinship matrix ) among the subjects ( S1 Fig ). In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving federated GWAS algorithm using generalized linear mixed effects model, FedGMMAT, that adopts an efficient and flexible two-step score testing [12, 45, 46]. FedGMMAT integrates homomorphic encryption ( HE ) and a symmetric One-Time Pad ( OTP ) -like encryption mechanism to protect intermediate statistics efficiently while being aggregated in the federated setting. Sensitive genotype and covariate datasets are not shared among the computing entities. We use real and simulated datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and practicality of FedGMMAT in terms of resource requirements. The source code and example data is available in GitHub repository https://github. com/Li-Wentao/FedGMMAT. 
 In the basic setup of FedGMMAT consists of the collaborating sites with local phenotype, genotype, and covariate datasets. Each site also have access to the design matrices that are used to define the random effects among the individuals. For modeling the polygenic effects, the genetic kinship matrix is used to parametrize the covariance of the random effect. The kinship matrix can be computed using a secure kinship estimation method [32]. Each site gains access to the partition of the kinship matrix that quantify kinship to its subjects to all other subjects. A central server is used for aggregating intermediate statistics in the federated protocols. Central server is assumed to be a trusted computing entity ( no collusions ) and is responsible for setting up asymmetric ( homomorphic encryption keys ) [47] and symmetric keys for encrypting matrices using a one-time pad ( OTP ) -like encryption ( S2 and S3 Figs, Methods ) and performing the aggregation operations in the protocols. Central server has access to the full design matrices ( i. e., full kinship matrix from all sites ). To protect intermediate steps, FedGMMAT combines symmetric encryption with partitioned noise matrices ( Methods, S2 and S3 Figs ) to flexibly and efficiently protect intermediate statistics in the computation heavy portions of the algorithm. We assume that Central Server is trusted and it adheres to the details of the protocols. The main risks entail hacking of Central Server and accidental leakage of intermediate matrices, which should be protected in protocols. After the keys are shared among all sites, FedGMMAT first executes the null model fitting using a round-robin schedule among the sites wherein each site locally updates the model parameters, encrypts the intermediate results using homomorphic encryption and passes them to the next site to be securely aggregated. The final results are passed to the central server which decrypts the aggregated matrices, updates the global model parameters, and shares them with all sites. It should be noted that null model fitting does not utilize any of the sensitive genotype data. After model parameter convergence, FedGMMAT fits the mixed effect model parameters using a similar round-robin algorithm. The final stage of FedGMMAT is assignment of the score-test statistics to each variant. In this step, sites work with the central server to calculate the score statistics and its variance for all genetic variants. In this step, the aggregation operations make use of OTP-like encryption rather than the HE-encryption to protect matrices to decrease computational and network usage. The final p-values are assigned using the score test statistics at each site. FedGMMAT makes extensive usage of encrypt-aggregate-decrypt-partition mechanism to securely aggregate and send partitions of intermediate statistics among sites. Since this mechanism only requires additions, lightweight symmetric OTP-like protections help with efficiently protecting the intermediate matrices. FedGMMAT also uses a secure aggregation protocol to send the final results to the server. The server decrypts the results and shares them with all sites. We demonstrate the performance of FedGAT using simulated and real datasets. The results show that FedMM achieves virtually the same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. The code and data are available in GitHub repository https://github. com/Li-Wao/FedGAT.

    Title: 
    Article: Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality. Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) offer promising advancements in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. While their accuracy continues to improve, research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness within African and Asian populations remains key for equitable use. Recent algorithmic developments for PRS derivation have resulted in improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. In this study, we benchmark the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. We find modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared with a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts. 
 Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most commonly diagnosed tumor type in American men, accounting for 26% of all cancer cases [1]. Several genetic and environmental factors such as age, body mass index ( BMI ), family history and ancestry are strong risk factors for developing PCa [2]. Men of African ancestry have 1. 5-fold higher incidence and those of Asian ancestry have a decreased incidence rate when compared to non-Hispanic white men [3, 4]. However, the genetic basis for ancestry-linked disparities remains unclear. PCa is a heritable cancer where 58% of disease risk has been linked to genetic factors [5]. It is hypothesized that genetic predisposition may contribute to ancestry-linked risk. Although genome-wide associations studies ( GWASs ) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) associated with PCa risk, they have primarily been conducted in European-ancestry cohorts [6–8]. Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ), which combine risk associated with multiple variants into a single risk score, are usually created using SNPs derived from these GWASs. Consequently, PRSs may share the population-bias of the European ancestry-based GWAS and cannot be confidently applied to non-European populations. These biases are associated with differences in linkage disequilibrium, causal variant status and differing causal variant allele frequencies across populations [9]. Admixture mapping and meta analyses have revealed rare and common risk alleles specific to men of African ancestry [10–12]. The challenge of integrating genetic findings with the well-powered European-based GWAS results has led to the development of several methods that correct the biases within the European ancestry results [13–17]. The variability in complexity and correction efficiency across these methods presents an opportunity to systematically analyze their performance in PCa. PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone [18]. However, given ancestry-associated PCa incidence and outcome biases, it is imperative that risk scores work equally well across populations in order to limit disparities. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of several published polygenic risk scores in the UK biobank cohort. Next, we trained polygenic risk score models using the largest GWAS summary data from the ELLIPSE Prostate Cancer Meta-Analysis cohorts and tuning dataset from the UK Biobank. Model performance was evaluated in held-out individuals from the UK biobank as well as in individuals from the held-out All of Us cohort. 
 We sought to stratify the UK Biobank cohort by ancestry so as to evaluate the efficacy of multi-ancestry PRSs. Extensive quality control was performed prior to ancestry assignment. We began with the 488, 377 individuals who had genotypic data. We removed 1, 807 individuals who were considered outliers in heterozygosity, had putative sex chromosome aneuploidy, or had excess relatives according to the quality control procedures completed by the UK Biobank. Continental global ancestry assignment was performed by integrating genotypic data and self-reported ethnicity, similar to previous work [19]. UK Biobank participants were split into three populations ( African ( AFR ) males = 3, 846, Asian ( ASN ) males = 6905. European ( EUR ) males = 209, 894 ) by using their self-reported answer to the question “What is your ethnic group? ”. Next, we performed k-means clustering ( k = 3 ) based on the Euclidian distance across the first 40 genetic principal components. The entire cohort was included in the clustering without regard for their questionnaire-derived population label. We integrated genetic and questionnaire data by assigning each cluster an ancestry based on the most prevalent self-reported population of the constituent individuals. This yielded high concordance between genetic and questionnaire data. 97% of all individuals in cluster 1 were considered ASN, 99% of all individuals in cluster 2 were AFR and 99% of all individuals in cluster 3 were EUR. Participants whose self-reported population disagreed with the computed population or who were in the 99th percentile of distance from the cluster’s center were annotated as a population termed Other ( n = 2, 381, Fig 1A ). We further assessed population assignment by comparing our clusters with published country-level assignments based on the top 16 principal components. This revealed high concordance between annotations. Moreover, participants that did not fall into our 3-population buckets were identified as Other, Iranian, and Asheknazi by Privé et al., 2022 [19]. Interestingly, the use of additional principal components enabled population classification of samples annotated as Other by Privé et al., 2022 [19]. This led to the addition of 2, 438, 4, 882 and 2, 406 samples to AFR, ASN and EUR groups, respectively ( Fig 1B ). Finally, we limited our dataset to all males who were categorized into either AFR, ASN, or EUR. This resulted in a final dataset of 220, 245 participants. Population assignments determined from the k-means clustering were utilized for all analyses. We annotated participants as cases and controls based on ICD-9, ICD-10, and self-reported information on prostate cancer status prior to conducting any genetic analyses. This process identified 13, 097 cases and 207, 148 controls in our dataset. Stark differences in population grouping, birth year, smoking, alcohol, and vital status were observed between cases and controls ( S1 Table ). Next, we aimed to ascertain the accuracy of published polygenic risk scores in our cohort. These scores were not derived from the UK Biobank and included both those which were ancestry-informed and those that were generated in a homogenous European population ( S2 Table ). Fitting of polygenic risk scores involved a random stratified 2:1 split of our dataset into tuning and testing. The split was stratified by population grouping and case-control status. No differences in prostate cancer status or risk factors such as birth year, BMI, smoking status, or alcohol usage were identified ( S3 Table ). Publicly available polygenic risk scores were evaluated in the testing dataset. Briefly, we trained logistic models on scores obtained from allelic scoring of risk alleles and the first 10 genetic principal components using the entire testing dataset with cross validation, regardless of population grouping. Evaluation of predictive power in the testing cohort was performed in two ways, both, evaluation within the entire cohort and evaluation within each annotated population ( S1A Fig ). We found that prediction AUROCs ranged from 0. 55–0. 67 ( Fig 2A ) when evaluating the entire cohort and compared them to published results when available. We note that our evaluation resulted in comparable AUROCs to those reported in the original publications. Population-specific evaluation revealed the highest average AUROC for EUR predictions ( 0. 63 [0. 58–0. 69], mean [95% CI] ) across all evaluated PRSs. Interestingly, AUROC for ASN predictions was not significantly different from EUR ( 0. 64 [0. 59–0. 68], p = 0. 46 ). However, AFR participants had poorer AUROC than EUR ( 0. 55 [0. 52–0. 58] vs 0. 63 [0. 58–0. 69], p = 0. 02, paired t test ) ( S2A Fig ). Moreover, we find that all tested scores, apart from PGS000714, were associated with worse predictive power in AFR ( Fig 2B, p < 0. 05, DeLong’s test for receiver operator characteristic curves ). Despite these overall lower performances, we find that an ancestry-informed PRS ( PGS000662 ) resulted in improved prediction in AFR participants ( AUROC 0. 59 ) relative to other PRSs. We estimated AFR-specific SNP weights by multiplying the SNP beta ( as calculated by Conti et al. [10] ) by the AFR allele frequency to better understand variants that may enhance performance in AFR individuals. This revealed that rs10090154, rs72725879, and rs11263763 were the top contributing SNPs for prediction in AFR. rs10090154 and rs72725879 are located on the 8q24 AFR risk locus near the MYC oncogene [11, 20]. Fine mapping in a European cohort has identified the association between rs11263763, located on 8q AFR and PCa risk [21]. Our results suggest that these SNPs may contribute to ancestry-specific risk in AFR. In conclusion, this study evaluated the performance of six widely used polygenic risk scores in the UKob and All of cohorts. We found modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared to a simple method prioritizing variants clumping and polygenic scores. Our results underscore the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts.

    Title: 
    Article: DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies. It is caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype. We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1, 520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model. Notably from this screen, we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG. We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms, and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG. 
 Nearly 10% of the US population has a rare disease, yet over 95% lack effective therapeutics [1, 2]. One solution to find new therapeutics is drug repurposing which use drugs that are already approved or under investigation [3]. When successful, drug repurposing screens provide immediate potential therapeutics that have already passed the rigor of human safety trials and may have a faster route of clinical approval [3]. Alternatively, they can potentially be used in an off-label capacity at a clinician’s discretion [3–5]. Even if a repurposed screen does not immediately result in a new therapy, it can still identify new biological interactions that can increase our understanding of a disorder. DPAGT1-CDG is a rare disease that results from autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme DPAGT1. It is one of nearly 200 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDGs ) [6–9]. Glycosylation includes multiple pathways where sugars are co- or post-translationally added to proteins, lipids, or RNAs [10, 11]. For proteins, it is critical for their proper localization, folding, and function [10]. DPAGT1 is part of the N-glycosylation pathway where these sugars are added to specific asparagine ( N ) residues, typically part of the canonical consensus sequence N-X-S/T where X is a non-proline amino acid [12]. DPAGT1 synthesizes dolichol-PP-GlcNAc which is the first step in N-glycosylation [6]. DPAGT1-CDG causes developmental delay, muscle weakness, and seizures, among other symptoms [6, 13, 14]. Less severe mutations in DPAGT1 can cause a form of congenital myasthenia syndrome ( CMS ) called DPAGT1-CMS [15]. Unlike DPAGT1-CDG, the CMS form has a known disease mechanism caused by hypoglycosylation of acetylcholine and calcium receptors [15, 16]. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that increase acetylcholine levels can alleviate muscle weakness symptoms in both DPAGT1-CDG and -CMS patients [17–19]. For treating seizures, antiepileptic drugs have also been prescribed for DPAGT1-CDG and other CDGs [20]. However, both of these treatments are palliative, and there remains a great need for better therapeutics for the multisystemic symptoms in DPAGT1-CDG. Drosophila share ~75% of human disease-causing genes [21] and have been regularly used in drug screens [22–24]. Drug repurposing screens in Drosophila have had previous success in identifying new potential therapies for CDGs. For example, our laboratory identified GSK3β inhibitors as a potential treatment for NGLY1 deficiency [25]. In addition, a drug repurposing screen in C. elegans identified the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat for treating PMM2-CDG [26, 27]. Thus, a drug repurposing screen in Drosophila for DPAGT1-CDG could help find new potential therapeutics for this disorder. In this study, we performed a drug repurposing screen on a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG to identify new therapeutics and biological interactions with DPAGT1. We identified 42 compounds that suppress the DPAGT1-CDG model and genetically confirmed many of the drug interactions. These 42 compounds include acetylcholine-related drugs, dopaminergic antagonists, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors, among others. Importantly, we find that both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor can partially rescue our DPAGT1 model. In addition, impairing dopamine ( DA ) synthesis or recycling can also partially rescue the model. Our data suggest that manipulating DA signaling is a promising therapy for DPAGT1-CDG and implicates a larger role of DA signaling on N-glycosylation. The compounds and pathways identified in this screen are potential new therapeutic and genetic interactions with DPAGT1 that may represent new treatment options for DPAGT1-CDG. 
 To model DPAGT1-CDG, we used an eye-based Drosophila model that we previously established [28]. The Drosophila eye is regularly used to study and model biological processes, including development [29–32]. In our model, DPAGT1 expression is reduced in the eye by RNA interference ( RNAi, UAS-GAL4 system [33], eya composite-GAL4 driver [34] ). Analysis of whole fly heads of the DPAGT1 model resulted in a ~65% knockdown of DPAGT1 expression ( S1A Fig ). The compound eye makes up a large portion of the Drosophila head, but this knockdown is likely even lower because our RNAi is eye-specific. In vitro analysis of DPAGT1-CDG patient proteins found they had 10–50% protein activity [35]. Thus, having at most ~35% of normal DPAGT1 expression is a reasonable amount of knockdown to model DPAGT1 deficiency. This knockdown results in a small, improperly developed, rough eye phenotype ( hereafter referred to as “DPAGT1 model” ) [28] ( Fig 1 ). To validate this small eye phenotype, we also created a second model using a different RNAi line ( BDSC 51869 ) driven by eya composite-GAL4. This model has a small, rough eye phenotype comparable to our original model ( S1B Fig ). The DPAGT1 model can be chemically or genetically manipulated to make the eye larger ( suppress the phenotype ) or smaller ( enhance the phenotype ) [28]. To find potential therapeutics, we used the Prestwick Chemical Library, a collection of 1, 520 compounds that are 98% FDA- or EMA-approved. We raised DPAGT1 model flies on food containing each drug and measured the eye size of resulting progeny ( Fig 1A ). We used a 5 μM drug concentration—a standard dosage for flies that does not cause toxicity [25]. We scored 8, 076 flies in total in the screen ( 4. 4 average flies per treatment ), and we calculated the Z-score of each compound by comparing their eye sizes to DMSO-treated DPAGT1 model control flies. We identified 42 compounds that partially suppressed the eye phenotype of the DPAGT1 model ( "suppressors" ) ( Fig 1B and 1C, S1 and S2 Tables ) and 16 compounds that enhanced the eye phenotype ( "enhancers" ) ( Fig 1B and 1C, S1 and S2 Tables ). 16 compounds resulted in no flies ( S1 Table ). Our positive hit rate of 2. 8% falls in line with other compound screens performed in Drosophila [23, 25, 36, 37]. We focused our validation efforts on suppressors that had ≥3 drugs in a particular drug class, had the strongest suppressive effect on eye size ( Z-score ≥2 ), or had high potential for patient use ( e. g. available over-the-counter ). Drug classes with the highest representation were acetylcholine-related drugs, dopamine ( DA ) receptor antagonists, COX inhibitors, and antioxidants ( three drugs each, S2 Table ). In total, we tested 20/42 ( 48% ) of the suppressors in validation experiments. Mutations in DPAGT1 can cause muscle weakness because acetylcholine receptors ( AChRs ) become hypoglycosylated [15, 16]. This muscle weakness can be treated by cholinesterase inhibitors which increase available acetylcholine [15, 16, 38]. Our unbiased screen identified three acetylolinergic drugs that suppressed the DPAG1 model ( Fig 2A and 2, S3 ). These drugs include the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors pyridostigmine and rivastigmine, as well as the acetylcholine receptor agonist donepezil. All three drugs increased eye size in the DP1 model ( Fig 2A and 2, S ). We also tested acetylolinergic drugs in DPAG1-CMS, a form of congenital myasthenia caused by DP1 hypoglycosylation of acetylolin receptors [15,16]. Donepezil increased eye size in DP1-CMS ( Fig 2 and 2, S ) but pyridostig and rivastig did not ( Fig 2 and 2, S ). The acetylolinergic drugs identified in this screen are potential therapeutics for DPAG1CD and DP1-CMS. DPAG1 is part of the N-glycosylation pathway where sugars are added to asparagine ( N ) residues [12]. N-glycosylation is critical for protein localization, folding, and function [10]. DP1 synthesizes dolich-PP-Glc which is the first step in Nlycosylation [6]. DP1CD causes developmental delay, weakness, seizures, and other symptoms [6, 13, 14]. Loss of DP1 can also cause a form of congenital myhen syndrome ( CMS ) called DP1-CMS [15]. Unlike DP1CD, CMS has a known mechanism caused by hypoglycosylation acetylolin and calcium receptors [15, 16]. Acetylolinase inhibitors increase acetyl levels alleviate muscle weakness in DP1CD and CMS [17–19]. Our screen identified three acetylolin drugs that suppressed DP1 model ( Fig 2 and 2, S ). These include acetylolinase inhibitors pyridostig and rivast and acetyloline agonist doneil. All increased eye in DP1 ( Fig 2 and 2, S ). We also tested acetyl drugs in DP1-C, a form congenital myhen caused DP1 hypogly acetyl receptors [15,16 ] Doneil increased eye DP-C ( Fig and 2, S ) but pyridig and rivast did not ( Fig 2 and 2 S ). Acetyl drugs in this screen are potential therapeutics DP1 and DP-C. DP1 is part of the N-glycosylation pathway where sugars are added to aspar ( N ) residues [12] Nly is critical for protein localization, folding, and [10.1 synthesizes dol-PPlc which is the first in Nly [6.1CD causes developmental, weakness, seizures, and symptoms [ 6, 13 14. Loss can also cause form congenital myhen syndrome ( CMS ) called -C [15 Unlike CD, CMS has known mechanism hypogly acetyl and calcium [ 15 16. Acetylase increase acetyl alleviate weakness CD and CMS [ 17–19.

    Title: 
    Article: Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity ( topo-VAE ) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions ( PDs ) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. 
 Somatosensation includes the familiar sense of touch, provided by receptors in the skin, and proprioception, the much less consciously perceived sense that informs us about the pose, motion and associated forces acting on our limbs. Both are essential for our ability to plan, control and adapt movements. In engineering, the control of robotic movement would be impossible if the controller did not know the location of its actuators; correspondingly in human motor control, popular frameworks for explaining many types of movement, such as optimal feedback control theory [1, 2], are dependent on feedback such as that provided by proprioception. Moreover, individuals with proprioceptive neurological deficits, such as patient IW, have profound motor deficits even in the presence of vision and an intact motor system [3, 4]. Similarly, recent major developments in the control of limb movement through intracortical Brain Computer Interfaces are centred on restoring somatosensory sensory feedback as well as effecting motion [5–8]. Thus far, these efforts have been almost exclusively limited to the sense of touch, in part because of our better understanding of that modality. However, restored proprioceptive feedback is also likely to be needed to adequately restore functional capability [9–11]. Unlike hearing or vision, proprioceptive afferent pathways originate not from a single organ but from diverse families of mechanoreceptors within muscles, tendons, joints, and even the skin [12]. Proprioceptive information ascends within the dorsal column pathway through the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal column nuclei, and thalamus before arriving in the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ). Crucially, neurons are somatotopically organised throughout this pathway, meaning that neighbouring neurons encode stimuli from closely related parts of the body. This gives rise to the sensory homunculus, which results from the ordered mapping of tactile representations of the body’s surface across the cortical surface [13]. Although proprioception is generally acknowledged to be critical to motor behaviour, the corresponding proprioceptive maps ‐ particularly that of primate area 3a, but also the mixed modality area 2 ‐ are much less obviously structured than those of the touch ( areas 1 and 3b ). We know that the proprioceptive and tactile systems often encode overlapping information, e. g. mechanoreceptors in our skin and interosseous membranes respond to deformation and vibration, contributing to the sense of body position and movement [3]. Indeed, the firing rates of somatosensory neurons with cutaneous receptive fields in area 2 can be used to decode limb movement as accurately as those with muscle fields [14]. While proprioceptive cortical areas are critical for our ability to generate goal-directed complex behaviour it is unclear what properties of proprioceptive cortical coding facilitate this capability. Crucially, we lack an accepted hypothesis about the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex. The limited nature of our understanding of proprioceptive neural representations in the brain is in large part due to the difficulty of delivering independent proprioceptive stimuli in comparison to other senses, such as vision [15] and touch [16]. To overcome this limitation, we combined computational modelling and natural movement kinematic data to test hypotheses of organisational mechanisms that are currently beyond the capability of microarray recording techniques, where the distance between electrodes is too great to observe spatial organisation at the level of neighbouring neurons. This combination of experiment and theory has been useful for explaining population-level coding in other sensory modalities, such as vision [17] and touch [18, 19], but has only recently begun to be applied to proprioception [20, 21]. Much of the computational theoretical work on other senses has either focused on predicting specific neural coding features from natural sensory statistics [18, 22], or has ignored the details of neural coding and focused on the spatial distribution of stimulus representation across the cortex [23]. Our chosen system was the proprioception of the right arm ( Fig 1A ) for which we had collected natural behavioural data from daily life in humans ( food preparation, eating, etc; Figs 1B and S1 ) as well as constrained, planar centre-out reaching in both humans and monkeys ( Fig 1C ). This data describes the joint angle kinematics of the of the body over time and thus stands in for the proprioceptive sensory state. We aimed to relate kinematics to proprioceptive encoding with modelling and comparisons to existing single-unit recordings from monkeys. We formulated a novel computational model that predicts both neural coding of single neurons and the spatial organisation of these neurons across the cortex ( Fig 1D–1G ). We chose a small set of general computational elements that reflect principles and mechanisms found in sensory systems but have not been previously unified, which are as follows: Models should 1 ) use the information maximisation principle, which postulates that efficient sensory representations in the brain reflect natural sensory statistics, and implies that they are essential in shaping neural representations, 2 ) be stochastic, generative, and decodable, to reflect the natural variability in the data, produce neural activity to mimic that of the biological system, and offer the means to reconstruct the relevant original sensory input from its output, 3 ) implement, in Marr’s sense [24], neural computations that are performed by locally interacting neurons through synaptic interactions, rather than by an abstract computational machine. In the context of proprioception, these principles require that our model should learn how to translate proprioceptive inputs from movements of the body into a latent representation of proprioception ( which is read out as neural firing ). In addition to performing efficient feature learning of a spike-based code, the model should have minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality, in that it can be generalised to modelling other regions of sensory cortex. By training the model on natural movement stimuli, it should learn representations that can maximise information about the environment with the limited bandwidth of neurons that is available at any given encoding step, thereby implementing efficient coding [25–27]. Given these requirements, we chose to use an unsupervised deep neural network model, a variational autoencoder ( VAE ) [28] ( Fig 1D ) to perform efficient feature learning of proprioceptive stimuli. The primary training objective of an autoencoder is to reconstruct the input stimuli, enabling the model to learn in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, in our use case, the encoder component of the VAE model parameterises a latent Bernoulli distribution to imitate the activity of spiking neurons. In following our third outlined principle and the observation that spatial organization is relevant to cortical coding, we introduce a 2-dimensional structure to the latent ( “bottleneck” ) layer of the VAE ( Fig 1E ). A conventional “vanilla” VAE model will capture the properties of encoded sensory features but would be devoid of any of the spatial properties of cortical neurons that are critical for determining how sensory stimuli are represented across the cortical surface. Incorporating spatial relationships in neural coding models has proven an important consideration for understanding neural computation, where anatomical structure and function in neural computation are fundamentally linked by biophysical constraints [30–33]. We therefore also implemented a topographical mechanism, using a lateral interaction term between the units in the VAE’s latent layer ( see Methods for detailed motivation and mathematical description; Fig 1F ). This term corresponds biologically to a spatial distribution of short-range excitatory and longer-range inhibitory synaptic interactions between neurons ( Fig 1G ). We call our model the “topo-VAE” and compared it with existing recordings from area 2 of somatosensory cortex. It could equally well be applied to other proprioceptive areas such as 3a or even 5. With further adjustments, such as replacing the linear decoder ( or even the MLP encoder ) layer with more elaborate architectures, it should be possible to apply this model to the study of spatial organisation in other sensory modalities, including touch, vision, and hearing. Here, the approach has enabled us to uncover novel insights into proprioceptive coding by linking anatomical structure and function so that we can test our model’s predictions using the sparse set of obtainable data. 
 We developed a novel model of cortical sensory representation ( see Methods for details ) that predicts both function and structure–the topo-VAE model. We trained, and validated, and tested our model as follows ( Fig 1H ) : We trained our topo-VAE model on natural daily human arm movement kinematics and explored the emergent representations in the latent space ( Fig 2A–C ). We found that proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centred co-ordinates depend on the velocity of the movement ( Fig 2A ). This result is consistent with previous studies [34, 35] that have shown that proprioceptive fields are velocity dependent on the speed of movement. We also found that the distribution of preferred directions ( PDs ) recorded from multi-electrode arrays in area 2 are consistent with our model’s predictions ( Fig 2B ). The model predicts that PDs are organised in a blob-and-wheel geometry ( Fig 2D ) and that few neurons encode a single joint ( Fig 2E ). These results are consistent with previous studies [36, 37] that have shown that PDs in area 2 are organised in a blob-and-wheel geometry and that many neurons encode multiple joints. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations and the theoretical basis for neural manifolds with applications to restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of humanoid robots.

    Title: 
    Article: Ethylene is a plant hormone involved in many aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to stress. The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants. However, only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes. We demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ) after the nomenclature used in plants. AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism. One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. Our data suggests a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions. 
 Food security is an increasing concern due to climate change and an increasing human population. Future food security will require sustainable agricultural practices that ensure elevated crop productivity while reducing inputs from chemical fertilizers, particularly, nitrogen, which can have adverse environmental effects. One of several strategies to decrease the use of chemical fertilizers is to inoculate crops with beneficial microorganisms. The establishment of plant-microbe associations in the rhizosphere is receiving increasing attention because of its profound effect on plant growth and vigor. The so-called “rhizosphere effect”, which describes the enhanced activity and density of microbes around the roots compared to the surrounding soil, plays a critical role in shaping the microbial rhizosphere communities which directly impact plant health and stress tolerance [1–4]. Root exudates not only support the growth and activity of rhizosphere microbial communities by providing nutrients, they also select for the microbiome and mediate microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions [1, 4–6]. The relationship between the microbiome and root exudates is bidirectional, as plant immune responses and phytohormone signaling can alter root exudate profiles [7–11]. Manipulating ethylene signaling or synthesis in plants or the application of ethylene can affect plant health as well as the population of microbes associated with the plant [12–18]. Ethylene was first discovered to be a phytohormone over 100 years ago and was the first identified gaseous, biological signaling molecule [19]. In plants, it controls and modulates many developmental and physiological processes and responses to various environmental cues and stressors [20]. It is naturally found in soil and depending on conditions, such as compaction and water saturation, can reach concentrations above 10 ppm, which is well above the levels needed to elicit responses in plants [20–23]. There are multiple sources of ethylene in the soil, including biotic biosynthesis by plants, bacteria, and fungi, as well as abiotic sources such as photochemical production triggered when sunlight is absorbed by dissolved organics [20, 21]. Almost all research on ethylene as a signaling molecule has focused on its role as a plant hormone and the signal transduction pathway by which it is perceived by plants [24–26]. However, responses to ethylene are not limited to plants, and have been reported in bacteria, fungi, slime molds, marine sponges, and even human cell lines [27]. Plants are believed to have gained ethylene receptors and other two-component like receptors from the cyanobacterium that is the ancestor of the chloroplast [28–30]. In support of this, many cyanobacteria contain genes that encode proteins predicted to have an ethylene-binding domain and show saturable ethylene binding [29, 31, 32]. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis has shown that plant ethylene receptors cluster with cyanobacterial proteins predicted to have ethylene-binding domains [33]. One such cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ( hereafter referred to as Synechocystis ), contains a bifunctional receptor called Synechocystis ethylene response1 ( SynEtr1 ) for both ethylene and light with a signaling pathway that includes a down-stream response regulator protein and a small non-coding RNA [32, 34, 35]. Unlike in plants, signaling from SynEtr1 relies on histidine kinase activity and phosphorelay to a response regulator protein [32, 36]. In this species, ethylene causes various molecular and physiological changes including changes in the cell surface leading to increased biofilm formation and phototaxis [32, 37–40]. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that putative ethylene receptors are found in other bacterial phyla, including many non-pathogenic proteobacteria that associate with plants [27, 32, 41]. This suggests that ethylene may be perceived by these bacteria to mediate their interactions with plant hosts. Most published studies examining the role of ethylene in plant-microbe associations have focused on microbe-induced changes in ethylene levels or signaling in plants [16, 42–44]. Direct evidence for saturable ethylene binding to a specific receptor in microbes affecting physiology has only been obtained in Synechocystis and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis [32, 45]. A plant-associated bacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, contains a gene encoding a putative ethylene receptor [32]. We call this gene Azospirillum ethylene response1 ( Azoetr1 ) following the nomenclature used in plants. Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are ubiquitous motile soil diazotrophic bacteria capable of colonizing the roots of a wide range of plants where they live as commensals [46]. A. brasilense Sp7 colonizes root surfaces and is used agriculturally to boost crop production [46]. While the plant growth-promoting effects of A. brasilense have been described in most detail in cereals, the beneficial association of A. brasilense with plants is not restricted to cereals since they have been reported in many plant species across botanical families [46] including Solanum lycopersicum ( tomato ) and Arabidopsis thaliana [47, 48]. Inoculation of plants with A. brasilense alters the expression of genes in the plant related to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling [47, 49–51]. However, nothing is known about the responses of A. brasilense to ethylene and the role of the putative ethylene receptor protein. This prompted us to examine the biological role of ethylene as a signal in this species and study how ethylene perception by the bacterium affects various traits including root colonization. Our research demonstrated that AzoEtr1 is a functional ethylene receptor that affects carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Our data suggest a model in which ethylene from host plants affects the pattern and density of colonization by A. brasilense. Because other plant-associated bacteria are predicted to contain ethylene receptors [27, 32, 41], this could represent a mechanism applicable to other bacteria. 
 In plants, ethylene perception is mediated by a family of receptors that contain a conserved N-terminal domain formed by three transmembrane α-helices and seven conserved amino acids known to be required for binding to AtETR1 from A. thaliana [31, 52]. Using the amino acid sequence of this domain from AtETR1, we previously determined that many bacterial species contain genes that encode proteins predicted to contain a functional ethylene-binding domain [27, 32]. The genome of A. brasilense Sp7 contains one such gene ( locus tag OH82_RS30505 ) that we call Azoetr1. This gene is predicted to encode a protein 525 aa long with an ethylene-binding domain at the N-terminus comprised of three transmembrane α-helices followed by a PAS ( Per-Arnt-Sim ), and histidine kinase domain at the C-terminus ( Figs 1A, S1A ). We observed the accumulation of AzoEtr1-YFP at one cell pole when tagged at the C-terminus ( Fig 1B ). In dividing cells, focal accumulation of AzoEtr1-YFP was observed at poles distal to cell division suggesting that AzoEtr1 is localized at the polar flagellum site. There is a predicted response regulator encoding gene ( Azorretr1 ) located just downstream of Azoetr1 in the genome ( locus tag OH82_RS30510 ) that is predicted to encode a protein that is 135 amino acids long and contains no other recognizable output motif ( S1B, S2 Figs ). Upstream of the Azoetr1 gene in the genome and in the same orientation are genes predicted to encode a peptide chain release factor 3, an aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, a maltodextrin or glycogen phosphorylase, and a hypothetical protein ( S2 Fig ). There is a small overlap in nucleotides between the start codon of Azorretr1 and the stop codon of Azoetr1 suggesting that the two genes are cotranscribed [53, 54]. We tested the function of Azo1 and Azorre1 by treating A brasil cells with ethylene or disrupting Azo1 and observing the effects on biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Biofilm formation was significantly reduced when cells were treated with eth or disrupted A1 ( Figs 2A, B ). Colonization of root surfaces was also significantly reduced when cells were treated with eth or disrupted A1 ( Figs 2C, D ). These results indicate that Azo1 is a functional ethylene receptor that affects biofilm formation and colonization of plant surfaces. We used RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to examine the effects of ethylene on A brasil metabolism. We found that eth causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism including the accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate ( Figs 3, 4 ). Polyhydroxybutyrate is a polymer of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3HB ) that is a biodegradable and biodegradable thermoplastic [55, 56]. The accumulation of polyhydrobutyrate in A brasil is likely due to increased activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxybutryl-CoA dehydrogenase which is involved in the production of 3HB from acetyl-CoA ( Figs 4 ). We also observed changes in the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism including the upregulation of glutamine synthetase and downregulation of glutaminase ( Figs 3, 4 ). These changes suggest that ethylene from host plants alters the metabolism of A brasil. We propose a model in which ethylene from host affects the pattern and density of colonization by A brasil and that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing eth ( Figs 5 ). Our data provide new insights into the role of ethylene in plant-micro interactions and suggest potential targets to regulate beneficial plant-micro associations. 
The article discusses the role of ethylene in plant-micro interactions, specifically focusing on the bacterium Azirillum brasilense, which contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azir Eth Response1 (AER1). The study shows that ER1 binds ethylene with high affinity and affects biofilm formation and colonization of plant surfaces. RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics reveal widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, including the accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters the density of colonization by A brasil and the bacterium implements an adaptation upon sensing ethylene, providing new targets to regulate plant-micro interactions.

    Title: 
    Article: The INO80 protein is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. In this study, we explored the role of INO80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body. Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. A reduction in the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) argues for INO80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target, H2A. Z. Instead, in the absence of INO80, a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes. These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization, thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema. 
 Mammalian gametogenesis involves the meiotic division of diploid germ cells that undergo homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination to generate haploid gametes. Extended prophase I during meiosis ensures the faithful execution of recombination to shuffle genetic material between homologous chromosomes by controlled introduction of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) at the DSB hotspots by SPO11 followed by their repair [1]. Synapsis between homologous autosomes occurs during the zygotene stage of meiotic prophase I. In contrast, non-homologous regions of the X and Y sex chromosomes in male germ cells do not synapse with each other [2]. During pachynema, DNA double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) factors no longer localize to autosomes, indicating the completion of DSBR. For the sex chromosomes, the DSBR factors sequester at unpaired regions, forming a unique chromatin domain called the sex body [3, 4]. The sex chromosomes in spermatocytes undergo modifications by several DNA damage repair ( DDR ) factors such as BRCA1, ATR, and its activator TOPBP1 at the unpaired ( asynapsed ) chromosome axes [5, 6]. The sex chromosomes also undergo chromatin remodeling to induce epigenetic silencing of sex-linked genes. This process is known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ) [7]. Incomplete MSCI leads to germ cell death during pachynema, causing male infertility [7]. MSCI is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) at the asynapsed axes and the incorporation of DSBR proteins at these DSB sites [8, 9]. ATR localizes to the DSBs along the chromosome axes [10]. Serine-139 phosphorylation of H2A. X ( γH2A. X ) at the DSBs by ATR leads to the recruitment of another DSB factor, MDC1 [6, 10–12]. MDC1 localization amplifies γH2A. X in the protruding chromatin loops along the axes, establishing the characteristic sex-body and MSCI [6, 13]. Chromatin remodelers regulate chromatin accessibility. They play roles in several cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription regulation. Chromatin remodeling enzymes can hydrolyze ATP to change chromatin conformation by moving, evicting, or incorporating nucleosomes. They can also facilitate specific histone variant exchange to change local chromatin accessibility. There are four major families of chromatin remodeling complexes, all of which play critical functions in murine spermatogenesis [14–20]. INO80 is the main ATPase subunit of the INO80 complex, which has broad effects on several cellular processes. INO80 is important in various DNA metabolic processes, including DNA replication, transcription, repair, and genome stability in several organisms [21]. The exchange and turnover of histone variant H2A. Z is regulated by INO80 [22–25]. INO80 facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) to the promoters of pluripotency network genes in ES cells [26, 27]. In yeast, INO80 is also implicated in removing and degrading ubiquitinated RNAPII from chromatin [28]. Like other chromatin remodelers, INO80 is expressed in several mammalian tissues, including the testis [18], and was reported to facilitate development in a context-dependent manner [18, 27, 29, 30]. However, it is unclear whether the chromatin remodeler INO80 plays any role in the meiotic silencing of the sex chromosomes. Here, we explore the role of INO80 in silencing meiotic sex chromosomes. We show that INO80 interacts with and regulates sex-linked gene silencing in pachytene spermatocytes. Further, INO80 promotes the opening of the sex chromatin during the zygonema-to-pachynema transition at the DSB regions. INO80 also facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors at the DSB sites and interacts with DSBR factors to facilitate the silencing of sex chromosomes. 
 Immunofluorescence localization of INO80 in pachytene spermatocytes revealed staining on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) for INO80 ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31] also showed binding on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 1C ). INO80 binding occurred at the zygotene and pachytene stages ( GEO Dataset GSE190590 ) [32] on both autosomes and sex chromosomes. INO80 localization on the sex chromosomes is more enriched at the postnatal day 18 ( P18 ) pachytene stage ( Fig 1C ). Additionally, INO80 binding sites on sex chromosomes were present at the DSB sites identified by the meiotic DSB marker γH2A. X ( GEO dataset GSE75221 ) [33] ( S1A Fig ). These binding sites include promoters, intergenic regions, and gene bodies ( S1A Fig ). Moreover, INO80 and γH2A. X binding in the sex chromosomes were correlated ( S1B Fig ), where INO80 binding is enriched at the γH2A. X binding sites ( S1C Fig ). These data suggested a possible role of INO80 in DSB repair and silencing the expression of genes on the sex chromosomes. RNAseq analysis of changes in P18 transcription from autosomes in wild type ( Ino80WT ) and germ cell-specific Ino80-null ( Ino80cKO ) spermatocytes ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31] revealed up-and down-regulated genes ( padj< 0. 05 ). However, the mean changes in expression remained close to zero ( Fig 2A ). In contrast, the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) ( padj< 0. 05 ) from the X- and Y- chromosomes remained upregulated in Ino80cKO cells ( Fig 2A ). When plotted along the length of three representative autosomes and the sex chromosomes, like autosomal genes, DEGs from sex chromosomes occur along the length of the chromosomes ( Fig 2B ). These data confirm that the lack of silencing of sex-linked genes is neither limited to a specific region such as the pseudo-autosomal region and not due to any positional effect. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis validated the upregulation of five representative sex-linked genes ( Ccnb3, Nxt2, Eda2r, Abcd1, Usp11 ) in Ino80cKO spermatocytes ( Fig 2C ), corroborating the RNAseq data. To investigate further the sex-linked gene expression in pachytene spermatocytes alone, we utilized meiotic germ cell synchronization to isolate homogeneous pachytene spermatocyte population [34] from wild-type and mutant testes and quantified sex-linked gene expression by qRT-PCR. We observed a similar pachytene spermatocyte population in both wild-type and mutant testes ( S2A Fig ). Synchronized Ino80cKO pachytene spermatocytes also exhibited undetectable INO80 levels ( S2B Fig ). An upregulation of all five genes ( Ccnb3, Nxt2, Eda2r, Abcd1, Usp11 ) in the synchronized Ino80cKO pachytene spermatocytes confirms the lack of suppression of X-linked gene expression during pachynema upon Ino80 deletion ( S2C Fig ). Consistent with transcriptional silencing, immunofluorescence analysis of the active form of RNA polymerase II ( pSer2 ) revealed its absence at the sex chromosomes in Ino80WT pachytene spermatocytes ( Fig 2D–2E ). These data correlate with normal transcriptional silencing. In contrast, In80KO pachene spermatocytes showed active RNAPI at the sex chromosomes ( Fig 2–E ) indicating incomplete silencing of sex-linked genes in the absence of IN80. To investigate the role of IN80 in MSCI, we examined the recruitment of meiotic chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) factors to the sex chromosomes in In80WT and In80KO pach spermatocytes ( Fig 3A–B ). In In80 pach spermatocytes, MSCI localized to the sex ( Fig 3A ) whereas In80 pach spermatocytes showed reduced MSCI at the sex ( Fig 3B ). These data suggest that IN80 is required for the recruitment of MSCI to the sex chromosomes. Furthermore, we examined the chromatin accessibility at DSB sites on the sex chromosomes in In80 and In80 pach spermatocytes ( Fig 3C–D ). In80 pach spermatocytes showed reduced chromatin accessibility at DSB sites ( Fig 3C ) whereas In80 pach spermat showed increased chromatin at DSB ( Fig 3D ). These data indicate that IN80 facilitates chromatin remodeling at DSB sites on the sex chromosomes. Finally, we tested the role of IN80 in the recruitment of DNA repair factors to DSB on the sex in In80 and80 pach spermatocytes ( Fig 3E–F ). In pach spermatocytes showed reduced recruitment of DNA repair factors at DSB ( Fig 3E ) whereas In pach spermat showed increased recruitment ( Fig 3F ). These data suggest that IN80 is required for the recruitment of DNA repair factors to DSB on the sex. We also tested the role of IN80 in the interaction with DNA repair factors at DSB ( Fig 3G–H ) In pach spermat showed reduced interaction ( Fig 3G ) whereas Inach showed increased interaction ( 3H ). These data indicate that IN80 is required for the interaction of DNA factors with DSB on the sex. In summary, our data show that IN80 plays a critical role in the silencing of sex-linked genes in pach spermatocytes. IN80 promotes the opening of chromatin at DSB on the sex and facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors to DSB. IN80 is also required for the interaction of DNA factors with DSB on the sex. These data suggest that IN80 is essential for the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachema.

    Title: 
    Article: The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development. It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration. In this study, we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1. We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA. 
 The ability of neurons to regenerate after injury is determined by a complex interplay between their intrinsic growth program and external cues [1]. Injured neurons need to receive accurate and timely information about the extent of axonal damage to successfully increase their intrinsic growth capacity and regenerate. One mechanism that contributes to this process is the activation of receptors by growth factors that promote the growth capacity of neurons [2]. In neurons, intrinsic mechanisms that mediate regeneration are conserved across species. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful experimental model for elucidating axon regeneration mechanisms [3]. Genetic screens have identified several signaling molecules required for axon regeneration [4–7]. Recent studies have identified the JNK MAP kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway as a key intrinsic regulator of regeneration initiation in C. elegans [8, 9]. The pathway is activated by a signaling cascade involving the mammalian HGF-like growth factor, SVH-1, and its receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ), SVH-2 [5]. Thus, SVH-1–SVH-2 signaling is essential for neuronal regeneration but not for neuronal development. SVH-1 contains a Kringle domain, an N-terminal domain related to a plasminogen activation peptide, and a serine protease domain [5, 10]. These protein domains are also present in mammalian HGF and plasminogen, suggesting that SVH-1 is a member of the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-2 is homologous to c-Met, a mammalian HGF RTK [5]. The sequence homology of SVH-1 to HGF and SVH-2 to c-Met suggests that SVH-1–SVH-2 functions as a ligand–receptor pair in axon regeneration ( Fig 1A ). In mammals, HGF acts as a growth factor for c-Met and induces the activation of complex intracellular signaling pathways [11]. However, unlike plasminogen, HGF lacks the Asp–His–Ser triad, which is essential for catalytic activity and cannot function as a protease ( Fig 1A; [11] ). In contrast, plasminogen possesses an intact catalytic triad and functions as a protease. Protease activity is essential for plasminogen to remodel components of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( Fig 1A; [12] ). Thus, amino acids in the catalytic triad determine whether the protein functions as a protease or growth factor. SVH-1, similar to plasminogen, has an intact catalytic triad. However, its protease activity is not required for SVH-1 to activate SVH-2, as with c-Met-mediated HGF signaling [5]. Furthermore, SVH-1 regulates larval growth in a protease activity-dependent manner, independent of SVH-2 [10]. The svh-1 gene is the only C. elegans gene encoding a protein of the HGF/plasminogen family. Therefore, SVH-1 has a dual-function: it acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a plasminogen-like protease required for larval development ( Fig 1A; [10] ). However, it is unclear how SVH-1 can function as a growth factor despite having an intact catalytic triad. Therefore, there must be a switch mechanism that converts SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor to function in axon regeneration ( Fig 1B ). Here, we attempted to identify the factor in regulating the functional conversion of SVH-1 during axon regeneration. We have genetically identified several genes ( svh ) involved in the JNK signaling pathway that regulates axon regeneration [5], including the svh-17/cdd-2 gene encoding cytidine deaminase ( CDD ). In this study, we investigated the relationship between cdd-2 and svh-1 in the regulation of axon regeneration, and show that CDD-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor. 
 Recent genetic studies have shown that the JNK MAPK pathway regulates axon regeneration in C. elegans [8]. The JNK cascade is inactivated by the MAPK phosphatase VHP-1, and loss-of-function mutations in vhp-1 lead to hyper-activation of the JNK pathway, resulting in developmental arrest at an early larval stage [13]. To identify factors involved in JNK signaling, a genome-wide RNAi screen was performed to isolate suppressors of vhp-1 lethality [5]. Ninety-two RNAi clones were isolated and named svh genes for suppressors of vhp-1 lethality. The svh-17 gene is identical to the cdd-2 gene encoding CDD ( Fig 2A ). CDD-2 contains a motif for the zinc-binding region of CDDs ( Fig 2A; [14] ). Phylogenetic analysis using the catalytic domain of the enzymes shows that CDD-2 forms a cluster with cytosine nucleoside deaminase [14]. To investigate whether cdd-2 is involved in axon regeneration, we generated a mutant cdd-2 ( km70 ) lacking the initiation codon using the CRISPR/Cas9 system ( S1A Fig ). Previous studies have shown that RNAi knockout of cdd-2 reduced viability [14], but the cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutant had no effect on viability or development ( S2A Fig ). We examined the regeneration of laser-severed axons in γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -releasing D-type motor neurons ( Fig 2B ). In young adult wild-type ( WT ) animals, approximately 70% of axons initiated regeneration within 24 h after injury ( Fig 2B and 2C, and S1 Table ), whereas the frequency of axon regeneration was reduced in cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutant animals ( Fig 2B and 2C, and S1 Table ). To confirm that the axon regeneration defect was due to the cdd-2 mutation, we constructed a Pcdd-2::cdd-2 ( genomic DNA ) transgene, an approximately 1. 4 kb genomic DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of cdd-2 and its promoter ( S3A Fig ). The introduction of the Pcdd-2::cdd-2 ( genomic DNA ) transgene as an extrachromosomal array significantly rescued the defect associated with the cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutation ( Fig 2C and S1 Table ). Another cdd gene, cdd-1, is present in C. elegans ( Fig 2A; [14] ). However, in cdd-1 ( ok390 ) mutants ( S1B Fig ), axons regenerated normally after axon injury ( Fig 2C and S1 Table ), suggesting that CDD-2 plays a specific role in axon regeneration after laser axotomy. Since our RNAi screen for svh genes was originally designed to identify components that function in the JNK pathway [5], we investigated where CDD-2 functions in this pathway. Previously, we have demonstrated that SVH-2 c-Met-like RTK, which is activated by the SVH-1 HGF-like growth factor, mediates the activation of the JNK cascade in axon regeneration ( Fig 3A; [5] ). We examined the relationship between CDD-2 and the SVH-1–SVH-2 signaling pathway. We found that svh-2 overexpression in D-type motor neurons under the unc-25 promoter suppressed the regeneration defect in cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutants, whereas svh-1 overexpression under the control of the ADL neuronal promoter srh-220 failed to suppress the cdd-2 defect ( Fig 3B and S1 Table ). These results suggest that CDD-2 functions downstream of SVH-1 and upstream of SVH-2 in axon regeneration ( Fig 3 ). To understand how C-2 converts SV-1 from a protease to growth factor, we examined the structure of svh-1 mRNA. The svh-1 mRNA contains a hairpin structure around the codon His-755 in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad ( Fig 4A ). This hairpin is conserved in sv-1 orthologs ( Fig 4A ). To investigate the role of the hairpin in axon regeneration, we generated a svh-1 mutant lacking the hairpin ( svh-1Δ ) using CRISPR/Cas ( Fig 4B ). The svh-Δ mutant exhibited reduced axon regeneration ( Fig 4C and S1 ), similar to the c- ( km ) mutant ( Fig 2C and S1 ). However, the sv-Δ rescued the defect in c- ( km ) mutant ( Fig 4 and S1 ). These results suggest that the hairpin structure around His-755 in sv-1 mRNA is required for axon by SVH-1. We propose that C-2 converts SV-1 from a protease to growth by modifying the sv-1 mRNA structure, specifically the hairpin around His-755 ( Fig 5 ). Our study demonstrates that C-2 is required for ax regeneration by converting SV-1 from a protease to growth factor. This is the first report of a cytidine deaminase involved in axon regeneration and highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in the function of a growth factor.

    Title: 
    Article: Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state, serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing, disease genetics, and the effect of drugs. The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents. The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems. In a few cases, the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles, or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins. Usually, however, while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors, it typically cannot be changed at will. Here, we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish. We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally. In particular, we probe the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene in zebrafish, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. The resulting col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. In this way, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system, changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model. 
 Animal groups exhibit a rich variety of collective behaviour, exhibiting complex patterns across different length scales, from a swarm of insects ( centimeters ) to large fish shoals ( kilometers ) [1–6]. Such collective motion may be interpreted as an emergent phenomena originating from interactions between individuals [7–9], which can be beneficial for the entire group [10–14]. Therefore, a reductionist way to approach such collective behavior is to treat the individuals as interacting self-propelling agents [15, 16]. In this sense, the animal group can be described as an active matter system [17–19]. Particular examples include flocking and schooling behavior of biological systems which can be reproduced in computer simulations [20–22], experiments with active colloids [16, 23, 24], as well as robotic swarms [25, 26]. Within the framework of a system comprised of many agents, or particles in the case of physical systems, the macroscopic behavior of the system can be controlled externally. In physical systems, state variables such as temperature drive phase transitions, or noise in agent trajectories leads to a dynamical ordering transition in active systems [15, 27, 28]. In biological systems collective behavior in schools of fish, for example, can be strongly influenced by predation [29] and swarms of midges may be controlled ambient lighting [6, 30]. What these diverse examples have in common is a system of individuals with certain characteristics which respond to an external change in the environment. However, another bottom-up approach is to tune the properties of each constituent. While often this is forbidden by nature ( the immutable laws of quantum mechanics in the case of atoms ) or impractical ( it is hard to control large bird flocks for example [9] ), some systems are amenable to the design of their constituents. For example, synthetic active colloids [16] are an idealised playground to understand the principles of active matter, exhibiting dynamical [24, 31, 32] or structural [33–35] transitions, complex plasmas constitute particulate systems with tunable behaviour [36], while the emergence of de novo proteins enables design of enzymatic behaviour [37]. Here we explore the possibility of tuning the collective behaviour in a biological system by changing the characteristics of the constituents in the bottom–up manner of the colloids and de novo proteins. For this purpose, we use the zebrafish system, which has a well-established collective behaviour that can be monitored in the laboratory by tracking the individual fish [38–40] and which is amenable to genetic modification [41–44]. Genetic modification has been shown to change behavioural patterns in groups of fish [45, 46]. By studying groups of mutant zebrafish, we can investigate how changes in individuals lead to collective behaviour and explore the underlying biological mechanisms that drive these emergent phenomena. The collective behaviour of zebrafish can further be compared to well established active matter models that encapsulate single fish properties [47–49], fish–fish interactions, [15, 20] as well as the interaction between fish and the environment [50, 51]. In particular, we investigated the behaviour of zebrafish carrying a homozygous deleterious mutation in the col11a2 gene ( col11a2-/- ), that is to say, both parents exhibited the same mutation. These mutant fish exhibited abnormal skeletal development [52]. We also observed several degenerative defects in their vertebral column, including vertebral fusions and ruptures of the intervertebral discs. Therefore, we expect the mutation in col11a2 to change the zebrafish swimming dynamics compared to the wildtype. Interestingly, we found that the col11a2 mutant zebrafish exhibited limited vertebral column bending during swimming, and they took a significantly longer time to change their swim direction than wildtype. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant zebrafish exhibited a more polarised swimming pattern. These behavioral differences are well explained by the Vicsek model with a simple modification on the orientation updating rule [15, 40], suggesting that the col11a2 mutant zebrafish exhibits reduced behavioral noise. Such reduction can be attributed to the limited bending of their bodies, intrinsically related to their vertebral defects. In this way, when interpreted through a simple active matter model, the state space accessed by the fish is controlled at the level of each individual in a manner analogous to simple tunable systems such as colloids. 
 The wild–type zebrafish and the mutant fish were bred and kept in the fish facility in the university of Bristol, following standard procedures [53]. Our behaviour experiments were approved by the local ethics committee ( University of Bristol Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body, AWERB ) with a UIN ( university ethical approval identifier ). col11a2 sa18324 mutant zebrafish have a C > A base pair change at position 228, which leads to a premature stop codon the triple helical domain of the α2 chain of collagen 11. Adult zebrafish ( 6 and 12-month-old ) were fixed in 4% PFA for one week and sequentially dehydrated to 70% ethanol. After fixation, full body scans were taken with a voxel size of 20 μm, using a Nikon XT H 225ST μCT scanner ( x-ray source of 130 kV and 53 μA without additional filters ). The generated scans were then reconstructed using Nikon CT Pro 3d software. During reconstruction, greyscale values were calibrated against a scan of a phantom with known density ( 0. 75 gcm−3 ) using the exact same settings. Calibrations with the phantom were used to calculate bone density. Morphological analyses were performed using Avizo software ( FEI ) and volume rendering function. Tissue Mineral Density ( TMD ) was calculated based on the segmentation of the centra from caudal vertebrae ( position 1-3 ). Alizarin Red staining was performed on 1-year-old zebrafish, as previously described [54]. Pictures were taken using a Leica Stereomicroscope ( DM4000 ) with a 580 excitation filter. Adult fish ( 1-year-old ) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 14 days, then decalcified in 1M Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) solution for 20 days at room temperature. Samples were dehydrated to ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sagittal sections at 8 μm thickness were taken. Selected slides were de-waxed and stained with Toluidine Blue [55]. Images were acquired on a Leica DMI600 inverted microscope, using 20X and 40X oil objectives, LAS software, and a DFC420C colour camera. Dissected spines of wild–type and col11a2 -/- zebrafish ( 1-year-old ) were mounted in 1% low-melting point agarose ( n = 3 for each group ) and SHG imaged acquired using 25x/0. 95 water dipping lens, 880nm laser excitation, and simultaneous forward and backward detection ( 440/20 ) with a Leica SP8 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope attached to a Leica DM6000 upright epifluorescence microscope with multiphoton lasers allowing fluorescent and SHG acquisition of the same sample and z-stack. Microscope parameters for SHG acquisition were set as previously described [56]. We used one camera ( Basler ac2040um ) to capture the motion of a group of 25 zebraf at 30 frames per second for 10 seconds with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The camera was placed 1 m above the water surface of the tank and the fish were recorded in a tank of 30x30x20x20 cm. The fish were kept at 20 C and the tank was illuminated with a LED light of 1000 lux. The camera was set to capture 30 frames per second for 10 seconds with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The camera was placed 1 above the water surface of the tank and the fish were recorded in a tank of 30x30x20x20. The fish were kept at 20 and the tank was illuminated a light of 100 lux.

    Title: 
    Article: Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model, the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming the network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously. 
 Capillary development, such as in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, plays a crucial role in embryonic development and wound healing, as well as the realization of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Cultivating blood capillaries is vital for the circulation connection and waste removal between artificial tissue and the living body [1–3]. Capillary cultivation in vitro can be classified into two categories depending on the experimental settings and lasting times [4]. The short-term cultivations typically last from a few hours to days. The necessary chemicals during the capillary developing process are offered well before the trial startup. Such tests usually aim to research the endothelial cell migration behavior or the interactions between the cells and their environments [5–7]. The long-term incubations, on the other hand, are generally over weeks or months to allow for the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or the functional proteins secreted from cells, mimicking the realistic environments for capillary growth and showing potential for applications such as wound healing and transplanting [8–10]. Since the 1980s, researchers have tried various substrates in in vitro capillary incubating experiments. They studied the relationships between endothelial cell behaviors and the mechanical properties of biogel materials. These studies revealed biogel remodeling, in which the cells exert traction forces on the substrates and disturb the material density during cell migration [5, 9, 11]. For different purposes, researchers have designed various biogels composed of specific components, such as the mixing of collagen and gelatin to simulate the environments where proteins are denatured in burns and scalds [12] or the coated fibronectin on scaffolds to study the fibronectin structures and functions for cell attachment promotion [13, 14]. Fibronectin is a biomaterial widely studied in recent years for its integrin-binding sub-domains, which can bind the integrin on the cellular membrane to stabilize the cell attachment. Moreover, together with its growth factor-binding sub-domains corresponding to various growth factors, fibronectin regulates growth factor sources in both in vitro and in vivo experiments [15–18]. Later on, thanks to the development of protein purification techniques, the mainstream research topics shifted to the endothelial cell responses induced by vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs ). The VEGF research can be traced back to 1977 when the vascular permeability factor ( VPF ) was discovered around the tumor cells to increase the capillary permeability and obtain extra nutrients [19]. Studies have confirmed that VEGFs present multiple functions for regulating endothelial cell growth, proliferation, migration, and morphology. VEGFs comprise five isoforms: the A-, B-, C-, and D-type and the placental growth factor ( PGF ), which induce the differentiation of endothelial cells into blood or lymphatic vessels [20, 21]. Among the five isoforms, the VEGF-A, comprising the most abundant 165-amino acids in the human body, is most related to capillary development [22]. Furthermore, the VEGF binding to substrates is commonly called the bound VEGF, which is considered to dominate the angiogenesis and vasculogenesis [23–25]. Besides, experimental results in recent years showed that the synergy between integrin and bound VEGF on fibronectin enhances the VEGF stimulation on endothelial cells, further promoting angiogenesis [26]. In addition to experiments, theoretical models and numerical simulations have been conducted to study capillary development. The simulation models have two categories: continuum- and cell-based models, according to their calculation methods for cell behaviors. The continuum-based model uses partial differential equations ( PDEs ) to describe the cell behaviors in a continuous spatial distribution. Murray and Oster first established an equation set that includes the dynamics of cell colony and extracellular matrix ( ECM ). Considering the force balance between the cells and ECM, they performed the linear stability analysis to explore the cellular network conditions [27]. Manoussaki et al. followed and simplified Murray and Oster’s equations into two-dimensional by considering the migration of endothelial cells limited on the upper layer of the matrix, successfully obtaining the mechanical force-induced visualized pattern of non-uniform distributed cells [28]. Namy et al. added the long-ranged elasticity descriptions for the matrix fibers to the theoretical model, making the calculation results more quantitatively comparable between experiments and numerical simulations [29]. In addition, Gamba et al., in the era of growing understanding of VEGF, assumed VEGF to be the driver of cell migration and obtained the chemical signal-induced cellular networks [30]. Cell-based models, such as the cellular Potts model ( CPM ), were developed to consider cell individual behaviors using a probability approach rather than that of the cell colony. The CPM framework, viewing individual cells moving on a fixed grid, can be traced back to Graner and Glazier, who extended the Potts model with several constraints suitable for living cells, and the cell alliances tended to be stable [31, 32]. Then, Merks et al. coupled both the cell-based and the continuum-based models. In their hybrid approach, CPM predicted the endothelial cell migration, while PDEs calculated the VEGF concentration [33]. Scianna and Munaron further included the intracellular calcium signaling induced by VEGF in their model, linking the VEGF to the cytoskeletal remodeling and elongation phenomena of endothelial cells [34]. Later, the VEGF sources were modified from the autocrine assumption to paracrine based on experimental evidence. Köhn-Luque et al. assumed that haptotaxis induced by the bound form of VEGF dominated the cell migration rather than the chemotaxis generated by the soluble form of VEGF [35]. Lima et al. combined the macro tumor with the micro sprouting models, suggesting that VEGF para-secreted by tumor cells provided endothelial proliferation [36]. On the other hand, van Oers et al. published a mechanical-based hybrid model with their successful simulations of cell networks and sprouts, showing that the capillary-like structures could develop via the pure stress and strain mechanisms between cells and substrates [37]. After considering several phenomena, such as vascular adaptation, vessel remodeling, and capillary collapsing, Vilanova et al. developed a model based on cell movement, expansion, and apoptosis, simulating the capillary growth consistent with the experimental data [38]. In recent years, Phillips et al. combined the confocal experimental data with computational simulations, predicting the total sprouting length via calibrating and verifying endothelial cell growth cycles [39, 40]. The complete driving mechanisms underlying the capillary development remain unclear. There was a consensus that the bound VEGF located on the substrates dominates the developing; however, the role of the soluble VEGF in the culture medium was commonly ignored [23–25, 35]. Most mathematical models included chemical or mechanical stimulation in the development separately; the integrated connection between the mechanical and chemical mechanisms was still absent [29, 41, 42]. Besides, although the computational results met experiments in certain conditions, several problems remain. For instance, mechanical mechanisms omitted the necessity of bound VEGF [42], whereas chemical mechanisms could not fully reproduce the results of the tilted biogel experiments [43]. This paper studies how mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation simultaneously work in capillary network development. We developed a hybrid model using cell-based CPM to predict the endothelial cell migration and morphology and using continuum-based PDEs to quantify the biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. The simulation settings and the capillary-like network results were referred mainly to the short-term experiments in the literature [44] without considering endothelial cells secreting and intaking VEGF. Close attention was paid to the impact of VEGFs in the solute and bound form, respectively. In the following, we first simulate an experimental case to ensure the correction of the computation in Section 2. We show how endothelial cell elongation induced by soluble VEGF and haptotaxis driven by bound VEGF regulate the network-forming process. We then performed parameter analysis for the network formation under various mechanical and chemical mechanisms. Discussions on the model features and limitations are in Section 3, and the summarized conclusions are in Section 4. Finally, we specify the mathematical formulation and computational procedure in Section 5. 
 Previous experimental studies have shown that capillary development is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, the mechanisms of mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of different VEG forms in the culture were unclear. This paper developed a hybrid model simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations using the Cellular Potts model to predict cell migration, morphology, and continuum to quantify biel deformation and VEG transport. The results showed good agreement between predicted topology and experiments, elongated cells forming network and cobble-like aggregates. The revealed that capillary networks develop in integrity when mechanical and chemical couplings work adequately, with morphology driven by soluble and bound VEG, respectively.

    Title: 
    Article: The Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF-β ) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance, repress, or generate novel functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-β ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2–function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Additionally, we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. 
 TGF-β signaling is a highly conserved mechanism that plays significant roles in development in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans [1–4]. This signaling family also plays an important role in the post-developmental adult in maintaining homeostasis and repair [3, 5–7], as well as serving as one of the highly conserved signaling mechanisms involved in the immune response [8–14]. The canonical TGF-β family signaling cascade is initiated by binding of a dimerized ligand to a heterotetrametric receptor complex and mediated through activation of the Smad proteins to regulate transcription [3, 15]. The human genome contains 33 TGF-β ligands, seven type I receptors, and five type II receptors [3, 16–18]. Currently, active research is focused on the mechanisms that mediate specific or promiscuous interactions between ligands and receptors and the consequences for Smad signaling. These mechanisms have profound implications for normal development and disease [19–25]. The number of potential interactions, however, increases the difficulty of these analyses. The reduced repertoire of ligands and receptors in invertebrate organisms provides an opportunity to study ligand-receptor functional interactions more completely. Due to the conservation of TGF-β signaling pathways, studies in the genetically tractable organisms Drosophila and C. elegans have resulted in universal insights into conserved signaling mechanisms. In C. elegans, there are five ligands associated with TGF- β signaling: DBL-1, DAF-7, TIG-2, TIG-3, and UNC-129. DAF-7 and TIG-3 are most appropriately classified as TGF-β/Activin-like ligands, whereas DBL-1 and TIG-2 share the most similarity with BMP ligands in mammals [26, 27]. Of the five TGF-β ligands in C. elegans, only two have well-characterized signaling pathways through which they signal [27, 28]. The TGF-β-like ligand DAF-7 is the regulator of the dauer pathway, and its expression in favorable conditions prevents entry into the dauer larval stage, an alternative third larval ( L3 ) stage specialized for harsh environmental conditions [29, 30, 31]. The BMP-like ligand DBL-1 activates the BMP-like pathway in the worm and plays a significant role in development [32, 33, 34]. UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3 have been classified ( as BMP-like or TGF-β-like ) based on their structural characteristics but have not been fully associated with all members of either the BMP-like or TGF-β-like signaling pathways in C. elegans [26, 27]. Previous work from our lab and others has demonstrated that the BMP homolog DBL-1 functions in the innate immune response of C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria and fungi by inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in response to pathogen exposure [35–38]. Here we demonstrate that the DBL-1 ligand is only one of four TGF-β family ligands with a significant role in the immune response to two gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We show that in response to either Serratia marcescens or Photorhabdus luminescens, multiple TGF-β family ligand mutants have a significant reduction in survival compared to control animals. We also demonstrate that two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, act independently of each other. In contrast, we have shown a non-additive relationship between TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like TIG-3, suggesting that these two distinct ligands act together in the immune response. Finally, we have identified signaling components with similar phenotypes to TIG-2 and TIG-3 in response to bacterial pathogen. Our studies thus uncover novel signaling paradigms that may act more broadly to distinguish distinct physiological outcomes regulated by TGF-β ligands. 
 C. elegans has five TGF-β-like ligands: DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3. It is established that loss of DBL-1, one of two BMP-like ligands in C. elegans, reduces animal survival on bacterial pathogen [35–36]. In a variety of physiological contexts, heterodimers of BMP ligands are functionally required or outperform homodimers [39–42]. We therefore considered the possibility that DBL-1/BMP functions with the other BMP-like ligand, TIG-2, in the worm. The DBL-1 pathway has been thoroughly studied in response to exposure to the gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens, where the worm’s survival is significantly hindered by gut colonization as a consequence of the pathogen supplanting the normal bacterial food source [36]. To test the role of TIG-2/BMP, we quantified survival of two tig-2 mutant strains on S. marcescens and compared these survival rates to dbl-1 and N2 ( wild type ) control. We used tig-2 ( ok3336 ), a 500-bp deletion allele, and tig-2 ( ok3416 ), an 800-bp deletion allele, and found that both tig-2 mutant strains resulted in reduced survival against bacterial infection ( Fig 1A ). Survival rates for both tig-2 mutant strains were significantly different compared to control. We further tested the effect of mutating tig-2 on immunity by analyzing the survival of tig-2 mutant animals on the more virulent P. luminescens bacteria. We found that tig-2 mutants survived significantly worse than control animals ( Fig 1B ). Interestingly, tig-2 mutants had an even more pronounced susceptibility to P. luminescens infection than dbl-1 mutants, suggesting a more significant role for TIG-2 in response to P. luminescens infection. Given that both BMP ligands function in the C. elegans immune response, we next considered whether they act independently or together by determining the phenotype of double mutants. If these ligands act independently, we expect the double mutant to have a more severe phenotype than the single mutants, reflecting the disruption of two independent pathways. If they act together, such as in a heterodimer, then we expect the double mutant to have the same phenotype as the single mutants due to the failure of individual ligands to provide physiological function. When grown on P. luminescens, tig-2dbl-1 double mutant animals demonstrated a more pronounced survival reduction than the tig-2 or dbl-1 single mutant animals ( Fig 1C ). Our survival analysis shows an additive effect of these two mutations combined. These results indicate that the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2–act independently of each other in the response to P. luminescens. At the time of these experiments, no phenotype had been reported for tig-2 mutants, so we were encouraged to have identified a biological function for this ligand. To rule out the possibility that t-2 acts as a pseudogene, we tested the expression of t-2 by RT-PCR. We found that t-2 is expressed in head and body wall muscle of the worm ( Fig 2A ), indicating that t- is not a pseudogene. Next, we tested the expression of t- in response to P lumcens ( Fig 2B ) and found that t- is upregulated in response to the pathogen. We also tested the expression of t- in response to S marcens ( Fig 2 ) and found that t- is upregulated in response the pathogen. These results indicate that t- is a functional ligand that plays a role in the immune response to bacterial pathogens. We also tested the expression of t- in response to dauer stage ( Fig 2 ) and found that t- is downregulated in the dauer stage. The dauer stage is an alternative larval stage specialized for survival in harsh environmental conditions [29, 30, 31]. The downregulation of t- in the dauer stage suggests that t may play a role in the normal development of the dauer stage. We also tested the expression of t in response to dauer ( Fig 2 ) and found that t is upregulated in the dauer. The upregulation of t in the dauer suggests that t may play a role in the normal of the dauer stage. We also tested the expression of t in response dauer ( Fig 2 ) and found that t is downregulated in the dauer. The downregulation t in the dauer suggests that t may play a role in normal of the dauer. We also tested the expression t in response d ( Fig 2 ) and found that is upregulated in d. The upregulation t in d suggests that may play a role in normal d. We tested the expression of t in response d ( Fig 2 ) and found that is down in d. The down t in d suggests that may play role normal. We tested the expression t in d ( Fig 2 ) and found that up in d. The up t in d suggests may play normal. tested the expression in d ( Fig 2 ) and found in d.

    Title: 
    Article: The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity. This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure, commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes. Here, we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ), known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A, is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae. Initially, we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Accordingly, upon DNA damage, NAT4 gene expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks. Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade, nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ), accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Consistently, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks, critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. Consequently, Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53, indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation, is reduced. Importantly, we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. Overall, this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity. 
 Yeast N-alpha terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ), also designated as NAA40, NatD and Patt1 in mammals, is classified among the family of N-terminal acetyltransferases ( NATs ), which is comprised of nine members in eukaryotes [1]. NATs have a distinct function from lysine acetyltransferases, since they catalyze the covalent addition of an acetyl moiety to the alpha-amino group at the N-terminal end of proteins [2–4]. Nat4 was originally discovered in S. cerevisiae and it has a conserved human ortholog hNAA40 [5, 6]. Unlike almost all other identified NATs that target a wide variety of substrates [7], both yeast Nat4 and hNAA40 function as a monomer and selectively N-terminally acetylate serine 1 ( S1 ) on histones H4 ( Nt-AcH4 ) and H2A ( Nt-AcH2A ) [8, 9]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that Nat4-associated N-terminal acetylation ( Nt-Ac ) affects critical cellular processes including chromatin function and regulation of gene expression, which in turn influences biological phenotypes like cellular aging, metabolic rewiring, and cancer progression [10–14]. Additionally, nat4Δ has been reported to increase the sensitivity of yeast cells to different cytotoxic agents, including 3-aminotriazole, benomyl, dinitrobenzene and thiabendazole [8]. Nonetheless, Nat4 has not been previously linked to DNA damage response. In eukaryotic cells, the chromatin environment is fundamental in regulating how cells combat DNA damage, since the generation of a DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) occurs in the chromatin context. Therefore, alterations in chromatin structure mediated by chromatin remodelers are instrumental for the prompt response to DNA damage [15]. To protect genomic integrity, all DNA lesions including DSBs must be detected and properly resolved [16, 17]. Despite perpetual DSBs from both endogenous and environmental stressors, as well as exogenous DNA-damaging agents like methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ), cells have evolved mechanisms to counteract this threat, collectively termed as DNA damage response ( DDR ) [18]. DDR is a sophisticated network involving the detection of the damage site that subsequently activates signal transduction pathways, often called DNA damage checkpoint ( DDC ) [19]. Initiation of the checkpoint signaling in budding yeast is orchestrated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases ( PIKKs ), with Mec1 and its mammalian ortholog ATR being a key player [20]. Mec1 is recruited to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) generated from 5’-3’ nucleolytic degradation ( resection ) of the DSB ends [21] and its regulation on DNA end resection leads to longer 3’ overhangs that facilitate Mec1-dependent signaling [22]. Downstream the DDR signaling cascade, Mec1 has two direct targets, including serine 129 phosphorylation on histone H2A ( H2AS129ph ) and the checkpoint control protein Rad9 [23–25]. In yeast, H2AS129ph is the first DNA-damage induced modification to arise in the vicinity of the break, also known as γΗ2A, and spreads over 50kb on both sides flanking the DSB [26, 27] stabilizing checkpoint factors and inhibiting further DNA end resection [28–30]. When a DSB occurs, Rad9 binds to damaged chromatin by interacting with H2AS129ph [31–33], facilitating its Mec1-dependent phosphorylation [25]. Importantly, stabilization of Rad9 binding at DNA lesions by Mec1 ensures a controlled resection process, since Rad9 is known for its role in inhibiting DNA end resection [34–38]. Rad9 activation primes its association with downstream effector kinase Rad53, positioning it for Mec1-mediated phosphorylation [39–44]. This leads to Rad53 subsequent autophosphorylation ensuring DDC activation [19, 40, 43, 45–48]. Once activated, DDC limits extensive resection to prevent excessive accumulation of ssDNA through various mechanisms, as well as amplifies the signal for cell cycle arrest and induction of DNA repair [19, 49–51]. The presence of fragmented evidence associating Nat4 to DRR has prompted us to thoroughly investigate this functional link. In the current study, we unveil Nat4 as a novel player in DDR, serving as a paradigm for the NAT family of enzymes. We initially show that loss of Nat4 in S. cerevisiae ( nat4Δ ) sensitizes cells to MMS-induced DNA damage leading to accumulation of DNA breaks. Further supporting the role of Nat4 in DDR, we demonstrate that its expression is induced upon DNA damage, and it is physically recruited at the DSB-flanking chromatin. Additionally, absence of Nat4 impairs the DDR signaling cascade, evident by reduced global deposition and spreading of H2AS129ph around the break in contrast to wild-type cells. Consequently, this reduced H2AS129ph leads to decreased Rad9 binding at the DSB in nat4Δ. Consistent with these, recruitment of the key upstream kinase Mec1 to DSB, responsible for mediating the checkpoint signaling cascade, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. As a result, downstream activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in nat4-deleted cells is defective, as indicated by reduced Rad53 phosphorylation. Notably, Nat4 acetyltransferase activity targeting histone H4 is crucial for its DDR function and checkpoint dynamics as evidenced by the deregulated DDR signaling in cells bearing a catalytically inactive Nat4 or expressing the non-acetylated H4S1A histone mutant. Overall, through this work Nat4 emerges as a novel player regulating the DNA damage checkpoint signaling, mediating its function through its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity on histone H4. 
 To delineate the functional landscape of Nat4 we analyzed its genetic interaction network utilizing publicly available synthetic genetic array ( SGA ) data in S. cerevisiae ( S1 Table ) [52]. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the significant genetic interactions ( S1A Fig ) revealed terms that have been previously associated with Nat4, including the regulation of protein phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis ( S1B and S1C Fig ) [11, 12, 53]. Interestingly, a less studied biological process amongst the most significantly enriched terms was the response to DNA damage prompting us to further investigate the role of Nat4 in DDR ( S1B and S1C Fig ). Therefore, we first assessed the phenotypic consequence of cells lacking Nat4 when undergoing DNA damage. Deletion of Nat4 caused dose-dependent sensitivity to cells exposed to the genotoxic agent MMS, which induces global DNA damage, compared to wild-type cells ( Fig 1A ). After observing sensitivity in the spotting assay, indicative of potential DNA damage susceptibility, we next sought to quantify the number of DNA breaks present after MMS-induced DNA damage in nat4Δ through TUNEL assay ( Fig 1B ) [54–56]. Interestingly, we found that the occurrence of DNA strand breaks ( TUNEL+ ) was significantly increased in nat4-deleted cells after 2 hours of MMS-treatment, compared to wild-type cells ( Fig 1B ). Subsequently, we examined whether the increased DNA breaks in the nat4Δ population would result in reduced cell fitness after longer exposure to MMS treatment. Using a Live/Dead staining technique that differentiates compromised cell membranes from intact ( Fig 1 ), we observed that natΔ cells exhibited reduced viability compared to wild-type cells after 4 hours of M-treatment ( Fig 1 ). These results collectively indicate that Nat4 plays a role in protecting cells from DNA damage. Next, we sought to determine if Nat is involved in the response to DNA damage by examining its expression in response to M-treatment. RT-PCR analysis revealed that Nat4 mRNA is upregulated in response to M-treatment ( Fig 2A ), indicating that Nat is induced upon DNA damage. Furthermore, we investigated the localization of Nat in response to DNA damage using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with anti-Nat antibodies ( Fig 2B ) and found that Nat is recruited to D-flanking chromatin in response to M-treatment ( Fig 2B ). These results suggest that Nat is involved in the response to DNA damage. To investigate the role of Nat in the DDR cascade, we examined the levels of H2ASph in response to M-t in wild-type and natΔ cells ( Fig 3A ). Notably, H2ph was significantly reduced in nat-deleted cells compared to wild-type after 2 hours M-treatment ( Fig 3A ), indicating that Nat is required for the deposition of this damage-induced histone modification. Consistent with reduced H2ph in natΔ, we observed decreased binding of Rad9 to DSB in nat-deleted cells ( Fig 3B ) since Rad binds to H2ph [31–33]. Furthermore, we found that Mec1 recruitment to DSB was significantly impaired in natΔ cells ( Fig 3C ), which is critical for H2 deposition and Rad9 binding [21–25]. As a result, Rad53 phosphorylation was reduced in nat-deleted cells ( Fig 3D ), indicative of defective DNA checkpoint activation [19, 40, 43,–48]. Importantly, the effects of Nat on DDR are mediated by its N-terminal acetylase activity on histone H4 as evidenced by deregulated signaling in cells expressing catalytically inactive Nat or non-acetylated H1 histone ( Fig 4 ). Overall, this study identifies Nat as a novel player in the DNA damage response, mediating its function through its N-terminal acetylase activity on histone H4.

    Title: 
    Article: Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i. e., cancer phylogenies, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1, 000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations. 
 Cancerous cells contain somatic mutations that override normal cellular controls [1, 2]. Evolution progresses as cancer cells acquire additional mutations that provide selection advantages [3], leading to genetically distinct cancerous cell subpopulations ( i. e., subclones ) characterized by sets of shared mutations [4]. Phylogenies describing the ancestral relationships of subclones in an individual cancer can reveal important evolutionary events, help to characterize the cancer’s heterogeneity [5] and progression [6, 7], support the discovery of new driver mutations [8], and provide clinical insight for treatment regimens [9]. Many cancer evolution studies use bulk DNA from multiple cancer samples to reconstruct phylogenies depicting the evolution of subclones in an individual cancer [10–16]. These phylogenies are also prerequisites for inferring migration histories of metastases [17, 18]. A mutation tree is an arborescence that can represent portions of a cancer phylogeny that satisfy the infinite sites assumption ( ISA ). The ISA posits that each mutation is acquired only once and is never reverted. A phylogeny that adheres to the ISA is a perfect phylogeny; cancer phylogenies are often perfect because of low mutation rates ( ∼1–10 mutations / megabase ) [19]. By definition, a mutation tree is a perfect phylogeny, and each non-root node in a mutation tree represents a somatic mutation present in one or more cancerous cell subpopulations. Bulk DNA data obtained by sequencing multiple tissue samples from the same cancer can be used to reconstruct a mutation tree by solving the mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) problem. In the MSPP problem, each cancer sample is an unknown mixture of clonal genotypes, i. e, clones, that are related to one another via a perfect phylogeny. The input to the MSPP problem is a matrix of the frequencies of each mutation in each sample; these frequencies can be estimated from the variant allele frequencies ( VAFs ) measured by short read sequencing of the bulk samples. Although perfect phylogeny reconstruction has a linear time algorithm [20], MSPP reconstruction is NP-complete even if the mutation frequency estimates are noise-free [21]. There are some special cases where the noise-free MSPP problem can be solved in quadratic time [22–24]. Until recently, no MSPP reconstruction algorithm could reliably build mutation trees with more than 10 mutations [25]. State-of-the-art MSPP reconstruction algorithms such as Pairtree [25] and CALDER [26] are capable of accurately reconstructing 30-node mutation trees, and in some rare cases, 100-node mutation trees. However, most MSPP problems have more than 30 mutations, and this necessitates that mutations are pre-clustered based on their VAFs prior to MSPP reconstruction [27–29]. When mutations are clustered together, the reconstructed tree is known as a clone tree, and many MSPP algorithms treat each pre-defined cluster of mutations as a single mutation during reconstruction. Clustering mutations is often referred to as subclonal reconstruction, because these mutation sets uniquely define subclones which are subpopulations of cancer cells that correspond to clades in the phylogeny. Unfortunately, using mutation VAFs to define subclones is an error-prone process that can lead to incorrectly estimating the number of subclones [30, 31], and incorrectly grouping mutations together that are in unrelated clones [32]. Reconstructing a clone tree using poorly defined subclones can yield inaccurate trees and lead to incorrect conclusions about the evolution of a cancer [31–33]. Pre-defining subclones before tree reconstruction can also result in the loss of critical information such as the partial order of mutation acquisition, which is crucial for analyzing somatic mutation patterns and determining prognosis and treatment strategies for certain hematological cancers [6, 7, 34–36]. Here, we introduce a new MSPP reconstruction algorithm, Orchard, which reliably reconstructs extremely large mutation trees, alleviating the need to pre-cluster mutations. Orchard accurately solves MSPP problems with as many as 1000 mutations and 100 samples. We benchmark Orchard’s reconstructions against Pairtree and CALDER on 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ) and 90 simulated cancers. These results demonstrate that: ( 1 ) Orchard matches or outperforms Pairtree and CALDER on reconstruction problems with 30 or fewer mutations while being 5–10x faster, and ( 2 ) Orchard greatly outperforms both competing methods on reconstruction problems with more than 30 mutations. Orchard achieves greater accuracy and scalability for large reconstruction problems by sampling from a factorized approximation of the mutation tree posterior, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior represents a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built tree. Consequently, Orchard samples from this approximate posterior by generating sequences of progressively larger trees, culminating in a complete tree containing all mutations. Orchard uses Gumbel Soft-Max Tricks [37–39] to sample trees for each factor, enabling it to sample complete mutation trees without replacement. This approach differs from existing methods, such as Pairtree [25], which uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) to explore the space of complete mutation trees, or CALDER [26], which formulates the MSPP problem as a mixed integer linear program ( MILP ). These existing algorithmic approaches have critical pitfalls: MCMC-based methods often converge slowly and are prone to becoming stuck in local maxima because samples are highly auto-correlated, while MILP-based methods can be extremely slow, may fail to recover a solution, or may only be able to produce a single solution in a reasonable amount of time. Orchard avoids these pitfalls because of two crucial properties of the algorithm: it samples without replacement, which mitigates the risk of becoming stuck in local maxima, and its search strategy retains and grows partial tree structures that adhere closely to the ISA, effectively pruning large portions of the search space. Orchard’s ability to accurately reconstruct large mutation trees enables a novel strategy to flexibly define subclones. To illustrate this new strategy, we introduce a simple phylogeny-aware clustering algorithm that infers subclones from a reconstructed mutation tree. On real data, this simple algorithm recovers expert-defined subclones as well as, and often better, than state-of-the-art VAF based clustering algorithms [27–29]. Orchard, along with the phylogeny-aware clustering algorithm, is accessible for free under the MIT License at http://www. github. com/morrislab/orchard. 
 The input to a mixed sample perfect phylogeny problem is a matrix of mutation frequencies, F ∈ R n × m, and the goal is to infer a perfect-phylogeny-compatible binary genotype matrix B ∈ {0, 1}n×n. Each column B:v in B represents the binary genotype for clone v. The rows of B represent mutations, where if Bjv = 1, then clone v’s genome contains mutation j. The rows of F represent mutations and the columns represent samples. Each entry Fjs is the frequency of mutation j in sample s, where Fjs ∈ [0, 1]. Since multiple clones may harbor mutation j, Fjs equals the sum of the frequency of those clones in sample s, i. e., Fjs = ∑v BjvUvs, where Uvs ≥ 0 and ∑vUvs ≤ 1. The mixing coefficients, Uvs, represent the proportion of cells in samples s with the clonal genotype v, i. e., the clonal proportions. The general relationship between F, B, and U, is: F = B U. ( 1 ) The basic MSPP problem assumes that F is noise free, and solving it requires finding a perfect-phylogeny-compatible binary genotype matrix B and a clonal proportion matrix U ∈ R n × m that satisfy Eq 1. In the cancer-specific, noisy MSPP problem, we assume that F is noisy, i. e. F = F + E, where E ∈ R n × m is an error matrix. The goal is to find a perfect-phyeny-compatible binary matrix B and clonal matrix U ∈ R × that satisfy Eq 1 and minimize the difference between F and F, i. e, minimize ∥ F − F ∥2. The noisy MS problem is NP-complete [21] even when E = 0, i. e, when there is no noise. The noisy MS problem can be solved in quadratic time when E = 0 [22–24]. However, when E ≠ 0, the noisy MS problem is NP-complete [21]. In this paper, we focus on the noisy MS problem. Orchard solves the noisy MS problem using a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogen, a novel result in this paper. Each factor in this posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a mutation to a partially phylog. Orchard samples from this posterior by generating a sequence of larger phylogen that culminates in a complete tree containing all mutations. Orchard uses Gumb Softax [37–39] to sample trees for each factor, enabling it to complete trees without replacement. This approach differs from existing methods, such as Pair [25] which uses MCM to explore the space of complete trees or CAL [26 which formulates the MS as a MILP. These approaches have critical pitfalls: MCM methods converge slowly and are prone to becoming stuck in local maxima because samples are auto-correlated, while MIL methods can be slow, fail to recover a solution or only produce a solution in reasonable time. Orchard avoids these pitfalls because it samples without replacement and its strategy retains partial structures that adhere to the ISA effectively pruning the search space. Orchard’s ability to reconstruct large phylogen enables a novel strategy to flexibly define subcl. To illustrate this strategy, we introduce a phylog-aware clustering algorithm that infers subcl from a mutation. On real data, this algorithm recovers expert-defined subcl as well, and often better than state-the-art VAF clustering [27–29. Orchard along with the phylog-aware algorithm is accessible under the MIT License at http://github. com/morris/orchard.

    Title: 
    Article: Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction ( Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0. 619, average precision: 0. 514 ), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets. 
 High-quality in silico prediction of antigen immunogenicity could be a key factor in the development of effective personalised therapies for cancer. Therapies based on tumour derived neoantigens, often specific to that patient, have gained traction in recent years. Correctly selecting target antigens is a critical step in treatment development, since the mutations in a patient’s tumour can greatly exceed treatment payloads. Rates of reactivity in peptides can be as low as 2–6% of called mutations [1, 2] for a given patient’s tumour when tested. In high mutation settings, this makes the ranking of candidate mutations key to designing an effective therapy. ImmugenX and the models benchmarked in this work focus on HLA class I presented epitopes, recognised by CD8+ T-cells, as the definition of immunogenicity; however, a similar architecture and training approach could in future be applied to class II and CD4+ reactivities. There are many models focused on predicting prerequisite steps to T-cell recognition. Binding affinity ( BA ) models such as netMHCpan ( 3. 0 and earlier ) [3] and MHCFlurry [4] are trained on quantitative affinity measurements of peptide-MHC ( pMHC ) complexes. Newer versions of netMHCpan[5], MHCFlurry[6] and comparable models such as MixMHCpred [7] are trained to predict whether peptides are naturally eluted ligands ( EL ) as measured by mass spectrometry. Several more recent methods have been developed using more complex neural network architectures such as RNNs [8] and transformers [9] to solve these tasks. Efforts have also been made to automatically benchmark existing models as new data becomes available [10], with current findings showing strong agreement between several models with overall high performance. A smaller number of models have been reported that predict other pMHC formation-related metrics such as pMHC stability [11], as measured by dissociation assays, and TAP transport efficiency [12]. Predictions based on these pMHC tasks are all known to correlate with T-cell immunogenicity. Direct predictors of immunogenicity have also been developed, with many using the above pMHC models as a basis. PRIME uses the MixMHCpred affinity rank, along with likely TCR interacting amino acids from the epitope as input to a neural network [7]. Gartner et al. [13] and Müller et al [14] built machine learning models taking existing pMHC models and engineered features as inputs, including some patient-specific antigenicity features such as expression. Integrated deep learning approaches have also been developed, such as BigMHC, which transfer-learns immunogenicity from its previously trained RNN-based EL model [8]. Due to low volumes of training data and small independent test datasets, these models have generally shown improved performance at the time of publication but some reduced performance on new data as it becomes available. This indicates current models do not yet represent highly generalisable underlying features of immunogenic neoantigens. TCR specificity is also a relevant task to immunogenicity prediction, especially when considering the application of personalised therapy design. The likelihood of immunogenicity in the context of a patient’s TCR repertoire would be a desirable metric for ranking candidate mutations. TCR specificity models can perform poorly on entirely unseen epitopes after accounting for biases in test dataset composition [15, 16, 17, 18]. Poor generalisation is likely due to a shortage of diverse datasets since the current repositories of paired pMHC-TCR triplets are heavily biased to HLA-A02:01 and a few viral epitopes [19]. While these datasets are currently limited in scope, next-generation screening methods may greatly increase volumes of paired data in the coming years [20], meaning an increase in TCR data from which to retrain existing models. Integrating TCR prediction into an immunogenicity model would allow it to take full advantage of these new datasets. Here we present ImmugenX a modular immunogenicity prediction protein language model based on the transformer architecture. ImmugenX comprises a pMHC submodule, trained sequentially on multiple pMHC prediction tasks. In the first instance, this provides the input embeddings for an immunogenicity prediction head model to perform pMHC-only immunogenicity prediction. ImmugenX is also extendable to additional patient-specific inputs, by appending embeddings from purpose-trained encoding networks, demonstrated here with TCR sequences. We show that ImmugenX achieves a state-of-the-art level of performance at pMHC immunogenicity on an independent cancer-specific holdout and is extendable to include additional features when they are available. 
 A sub-module of ImmugenX was trained to encode peptide-MHC input pairs for downstream immunogenicity prediction by training iteratively on related pMHC prediction tasks. This allows us to use all available data on immunogenicity related pMHC prediction tasks in the training of ImmugenX. Performance on these sub-tasks was assessed by comparison to state-of-the-art models at each stage. First, the BA task was assessed against MHCFlurry 2. 0 [6] on an IEDB [21] search for BA data deposited after 2021, filtered for 8mer similarity to the training set, ensuring a clean test set for both models. Second, using the NetMHCpan 4. 1 single-allelic eluted ligand ( EL ) dataset, we compared to BigMHC-EL and NetMHCpan 4. 1. Finally, during stability training, similarity to the NetMHCstabpan [11] results was assessed using cross-validation. The BA task results can be seen in Fig 1B showing comparable performance to MHCFlurry, a well validated model for BA prediction. This demonstrates the first stage of training for the ImmugenX pMHC module accurately represents the binding affinity of unseen pMHC complexes. This severs as a basis for transfer learning to additional tasks in the next training steps. The EL task performance similarly showed comparable performance between the tested models and ImmugenX. MHCFlurry was not assessed on this test dataset due to some overlap between their EL training set and this test set, which was also noted by the BigMHC authors. Overall performance and a breakdown of performance by HLA allele are shown in Fig 1C. Fig 1D shows a comparison of the performance of ImmugenX on the stability task, both training from scratch and with the EL-trained model as the starting model. Due to the shortage of stability data available, a holdout test set was not practical for this task. Similarly, a direct comparison with the NetMHCstabpan model was not possible since both their model and ImmugenX use all of the available data in training and netMHCstabpan is not currently available in a re-trainable format. We see a similarly high Pearson’s correlation coefficient to the netMHCstabpan paper, with a best PCC of 0. 88 across all available alleles. The model performed best when pretrained with the BA and EL tasks compared to being trained only on the stability data. An improvement in runtime is achieved in ImmugenX compared to NetMHCstabpan. Benchmark pools of 50, 000 pMHC pairs run through ImmugenX’s stability module in a uniform 52s on a laptop with an M1 chip and 16GB of RAM, whereas the same pools took between 2–20 minutes with NetMHCstabpan depending on peptide length and HLA diversity. This iterative training method produced a high performance pMHC module for use in downstream immunogenicity task training. The full ImmugenX model for pMHC prediction, shown in Fig 2A, was further trained on CD8+ assay data to predict immunogenicity of a given pMHC pair. Fig 2B and 2C show the receiver-operator characteristic ( ROC ) and precision-recall curves for ImmugenX compared to its sub-module iterations and other published prediction models on a holdout cancer pMHC immunogenicity dataset. The unseen test dataset composition is shown in 2D. Two versions of ImmugenX were compared, with versions of the pMHC sub-module trained up until the EL task and the full model also trained with stability task. The model trained on all three tasks showed the best performance on immunogenic prediction with an AUC of 0. 619 and precision of 0. 514. This is a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model, PRIME [7]. Immugen outperforms all other models on immunogenic prediction with the integration of TCR information. The TCR sub-module was trained on paired pM-TCR triplets from the IED [22] dataset. The performance of Immugen with TCR integration is shown in Fig 2E and 2F. The AUC and precision of Immugen with TCR is 0. 7 and 0 0. 6 respectively compared to 0. 5 and 0.4 without TCR. This shows that TCR information improves the immunogenic prediction of Immugen. The performance of Immugen was further analysed for interpretability to locate areas of weakness across existing immunogenic models and highlight possible biases in public datasets.

    Title: 
    Article: The quality of meat is important to the consumer. Color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is characterized mainly into lightness, redness, and yellowness. Here, we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6. 24 kb QTL region ( GGA15: 6298. 34–6304. 58 kb ). This analysis revealed that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8. 65E-08 ). The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2. 9E-12 ). Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles. In addition, the predominant myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence, we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP ( rs315520807, C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity. The differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, frequency of rs315520807 variant, expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. In this study, PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color, and the novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected. 
 Meat is one of the most important sources of high-quality proteins for humans. Meat quality is important to the consumer and represents a critical issue for the livestock production industry [1–4]. Meat quality traits are complex and are usually determined by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors [5]. Meat color is the first sensory information available to consumers and is determined by the dimensions of lightness, redness, and yellowness. Redness and yellowness are chromatically determined by pigment content, and lightness is chromatically determined by microstructure [6] Meat color not only influences appearance but is also correlated with pH, muscle fiber characteristics and lipid deposition. Severe myopathy related to meat color, including pale, soft, exudative ( PSE ) meat, results in consumer rejection and severe economic losses in the industry. Understanding the genetic basis of meat color is important for the innovation of modern meat improvement technology. Some causative or related genes for meat color have been identified in chickens and domestic pigs. Strong relationships between beta-carotene oxygenase 1 ( BCO1 ) [7] and chicken yellowness and between myosin heavy chain 3 ( MYH3 ) [8] and redness/intramuscular fat in pig skeletal muscle have been reported. Changes in meat lightness might be related to changes in muscle glycolytic potential [9]. The Rendement Napole gene ( RN ) [10] and phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 1 ( PHKG1 ) [11] were found to be involved in glycolytic potential. However, the causal genes for meat lightness and redness have not been identified. Efficient strategies for exploring functional genes include genome-wide association studies ( GWASs ) and gene-based association analysis [12–17]. Major QTLs and candidate genes affecting complex quantitative traits have been identified [15]; however, causal relationships are difficult to determine. In recent years, the Mendelian randomization ( MR ) method has been widely applied in the search for disease/pathogenic causal factors [18, 19]. The MR method uses genetic variants to determine whether an observational association between a risk factor and an outcome trait is consistent with a causal effect [20]. Meat color is a complex trait because it is influenced by both muscle development and tissue metabolism. Muscle cells remain metabolically active after slaughter. Studying animals in vivo is the preferred approach for verifying gene function and exploring the underlying mechanisms involved. However, this approach requires a time-inducible and skeletal muscle-specific knockout mouse model with a high degree of mimicry, in which normal gene expression during embryonic and early development ensures normal tissue development. The knockout of a candidate gene that has broad roles and is functionally important [21] at an early age will result in severe harm. A relatively short induction period to downregulate target gene expression was more suitable for the study of post-slaughter traits. In the present study, the causative gene and potential causative variant of chicken breast muscle color lightness and redness were identified through a combination of GWAS, gene-based association analysis, and MR analysis. Further experiments in inducible skeletal muscle-specific knockout ( SSKO ) mice verified the gene function, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms were revealed through targeted metabolome and transcriptome analyses. 
 The descriptive statistics of the meat color traits of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens are shown in Table 1. The mean value for meat lightness ( L*15 min ) was 52. 43, that for redness ( a*15 min ) was 10. 25, and that for yellowness ( b*15 min ) was 12. 77. The coefficient of variation of L*15 min was 3. 48%, that of a*15 min was 14. 60%, and that of b*15 min was 15. 91%. To identify QTLs affecting chicken meat color, we performed a GWAS for the L* and a* values of breast muscle from 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens with 9, 760, 228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ). A single association peak was observed on chromosome 15 ( Figs 1A and S1 ). A total of eight SNPs for L*15 min and 14 SNPs for a*15 min reached the suggestive significance threshold ( P = 1. 02E-07 ) ; these SNPs spanned a QTL interval from 6298. 34 to 6304. 58 kb along chromosome 15 ( S1 Table ). The details of the lead SNP rs315520807 ( GGA15: 6298343 ) are shown in Table 2. We next calculated the pairwise linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) between the SNPs within 500 kb upstream and downstream of the primary locus and the lead SNP. Six significant SNPs spanning a region from 6298. 34 kb to 6304. 58 kb had strong LD ( r2 > 0. 8, Fig 1B ). Moreover, we performed gene-based association analysis and identified 11, 821 gene–trait association pairs ( Figs 1C and S2 ). The results revealed that only PPP1CC was significantly associated with the meat color L* and a* values ( P = 8. 65E-08 and 1. 47E-07, respectively ). The causal relationship between L*15 min and PPP1CC expression was robust ( P Weighted median < 2. 91E-12, P Inverse variance weighted < 8. 32E-25 ). Additionally, a strong causal association was observed between a*15 min and PPP1CC expression ( P Weighted median < 1. 16E-14, P Inverse variance weighted < 8. 54E-24 ) ( S2 Table ). The scatter diagram illustrates the negative effect of PPP1CC on L*15 min ( Fig 2A ) and the positive effect of PPP1CC on a*15 min ( Fig 2B ). However, none of the curves in the scatter diagram passed through the origin point. Consistent individual effects of PPP1CC SNPs on L*15 min and a*15 min are depicted in the forest plots ( Fig 2C and 2D ). All causal associations showed no evidence of pleiotropy ( P > 0. 05, S3 Table ). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis revealed that the causal inference was not substantially driven by any individual SNP ( S3A and S3B Fig ). All instrumental variables ( IVs ) showed no evidence of heterogeneity ( Q > 0. 05, S3 Table ). The funnel plot also revealed no evidence of obvious heterogeneity across the estimates, indicating the absence of potential pleiotropic effects ( S3C and S3D Fig ). These results provide solid evidence that meat color traits ( L*15 min and a*15 min ) may be regulated by PPP1CC gene expression. The curves in the scatter diagram revealed that there were still some effects on meat color traits other than PPP1CC gene expression, but these effects were independent of these instrument variables ( IVs ). The PPP1CC-SSKO mice with a genotype of PPP1CC ( fl/fl; ACTA1-creER ( Tg ) ) and control mice with a genotype of PPP1CC ( fl/fl; ACTA1-creER ( 0 ) ) were used to verify the function of PPP1 in meat color. The mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks of age and muscle samples were taken from the limb. The results showed that PPP1-SS mice had significantly increased lightness ( L* min ) and decreased myoglobin content compared to control mice ( Fig 3A and 3B ). Moreover, predominant myofibers shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myibers ( Fig 3C and 3 ). The expression of myosin heavy chain 1 ( MYH1 ) and myosin light chain 2A ( MY2A ) decreased in PPP-SS mice compared to control ( Fig 3 and 3 ), whereas myosin heavy chain 3 ( MY3 ) and myosin light 2B (2B ) increased ( Fig 3 and 3 ). The expression of myosin heavy chain 1 ( MY1 ) and myos light 2A (A ) decreased in PPP-SS mice compared to control ( Fig 3 and 3 ) whereas myos heavy 3 ( MY ) and my light 2B (B ) increased ( Fig 3 and 3 ) The expression of myosin heavy 1 ( MY ) and my light 2 (A ) decreased in PPP-SS compared to control ( Fig 3 and 3 whereas my heavy 3 ( MY ) and light 2B ( ) increased ( Fig 3 and 3 The expression of myosin heavy ( MY ) and light (A ) decreased in PPPSS compared to control ( Fig 3 and 3 whereas heavy ( MY ) and light (B ) increased ( Fig 3 and 3 The expression of myos heavy MY and light decreased in PPPSS compared to control Fig 3 and whereas heavy MY and light increased Fig 3 The expression of myos heavy MY and light decreased in PPPSS compared to control Fig 3 whereas heavy MY and light increased Fig The expression of my heavy MY and light decreased in PPP compared control Fig whereas heavy and light Fig The expression of heavy MY and light decreased in PPP compared control whereas heavy and light The expression of MY and light decreased in PPP compared heavy whereas and light The expression and light in PPP decreased compared heavy and light The expression light in PPP decreased compared heavy and light The expression of light in PPP decreased heavy and light The expression of in PPP decreased heavy and light The expression in PPP decreased heavy and The expression in PPP decreased heavy The expression in PPP decreased heavy The expression in PPP decreased The expression in PPP The expression decreased The expression in PPP The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression The expression

    Title: 
    Article: Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina. It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells, which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina. This calls for efficient methods, which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits. Here, we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility. STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings. 
 Retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, are classically modelled with a linear-nonlinear ( LN ) model [1]. This can take the center-surround structure of their receptive fields into account, but indiscriminately considers luminance signals inside the receptive field to be integrated linearly and passed through a nonlinearity only afterwards, at the model’s output stage. While the LN model is still popular due to its simplicity, it has long been known that many ganglion cells respond strongly to spatially structured stimuli, even when there is no net-change in the average illumination of the receptive field [2–6]–a characteristic the LN model cannot replicate. This spatial nonlinearity is mediated via functional subunits in the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells. These enable various specific computations that would be impossible without them, from sensitivity to fine spatial structures to various types of motion and pattern sensitivity [7–13]. Moreover, nonlinear spatial integration also plays a major role in shaping ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli [14–16]. The biological correlate of receptive field subunits are the retina’s bipolar cells, which have been found to rectify their excitatory inputs to ganglion cells [6, 17, 18]. Given the importance of spatially nonlinear processing in the retina, understanding the underlying circuits is highly desirable. For retinal ganglion cells, extracellular recordings with multielectrode arrays [19] allow large-scale functional characterizations that can capture the diversity of cell types [20–23]. For bipolar cells, progress has been made on large-scale recordings using glutamate imaging [24, 25], but it is difficult to combine these techniques to obtain information about the connectivity between large populations of bipolar and ganglion cells. As an alternative, several approaches have been developed to infer subunits and thus connected bipolar cells from ganglion cell recordings alone [26–31]. However, these approaches are often based on ganglion cell responses to fine spatiotemporal white noise stimuli, which generally evoke comparatively weak responses, making long recordings necessary. Limited recording time may thus obstruct reliable subunit identification or curtail the functional investigations of subunit layouts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method to identify the layout of subunits composing a ganglion cell’s receptive field that makes use of stimuli specifically targeted towards the computational characteristics of subunits and that has the potential of considerably reducing the required recording time. The method combines the functional principles underlying stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy [32, 33] and tomographic imaging such as computed tomography ( CT ) scans [34], and we accordingly term it super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ). In this manuscript, we investigate the potential of STR via comprehensive modelling and electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells. 
 Retinal ganglion cells often display spatially nonlinear integration of luminance signals [2]. Fig 1A and 1B exemplifies this with responses of an On parasol cell recorded in the isolated marmoset retina. The cell responded strongly to increases of luminance during a full-field stimulus, but not to decreases of luminance ( Fig 1A ). On the other hand, a stimulus that involved reversals of a spatial pattern while keeping the mean luminance inside the receptive field constant also led to substantial responses ( Fig 1B ). This nonlinear spatial integration of luminance inside the receptive field of a ganglion cell is mediated via so-called subunits, which are believed to tile the receptive field and to correspond to bipolar cells, the source of the excitatory input to ganglion cells [3, 5, 6, 17, 27]. To develop a method for identifying the layout of subunits by recording ganglion cell responses to visual stimuli, we set up computational subunit models to simulate the response to a flashed spatial pattern. For concreteness, we focused the models on On-type ganglion cells. We modelled the nonlinear spatial integration by approximating both the subunits, i. e., bipolar cells, and the ganglion cell itself as separate LN integration stages, yielding an LNLN-like model. The first stage consisted of a linear spatial integration at the level of the subunits, which we portrayed as 2D Gaussian filters applied to the image’s Weber contrast values, followed by a rectification. At the level of the ganglion cell, the subunit outputs were then summed before a final transformation resulted in the model’s response, given as the average spike count or firing rate elicited by the flashed spatial pattern. A simple approach to probe the spatial sensitivity profile of a ganglion cell is to flash a small spot of light ( Fig 1C, left ) at different locations across the cell’s receptive field. As illustrated for a schematic model with four circular subunits ( Fig 1C, center ), the responses of the model ( Fig 1C, right ) together map out its receptive field, which corresponds to the union of the subunits. Since the subunits have no gaps between each other and even overlap, individual subunits can usually not be identified by reproducing the receptive field. To enable detection of the subunit structure inside a receptive field, our approach is to add a suppressive dark ring, or annulus, around the excitatory spot, leading to a shape that is commonly known as a Mexican hat ( Fig 1D, left ). By applying this stimulus, we make use of the linear luminance integration within subunits and the nonlinear integration across subunits. For instance, the average luminance of the hat is the same as the background gray ( similar to the example of Fig 1B ), but the model still produces responses due to its spatially nonlinear computation ( Fig 1D, right ). If the size of the hat is similar to the size of the subunits, an individual subunit will only be activated by the stimulus if the hat is placed close to its center. In this case, the suppressive ring of the stimulus plays a subordinate role for that subunit, due to the subunit’s greater sensitivity closer to its center, which is a reasonable assumption even if the exact Gaussian shape is a simplification. On the other hand, if the stimulus is placed at the overlap of two or more subunits, each subunit will be triggered significantly less or not at all, because the suppressive ring now strikes the more sensitive central parts of the subunits, while the excitatory white spot only hits the periphery of each of the subunits. Comparing the response maps obtained with the simple homogeneous spot ( Fig 1C ) and with the Mexican-hat shaped spot ( Fig 1D ), similar response strengths are obtained for spots placed at the center of a subunit, because a suppressive ring does not decisively affect that subunit and the suppression of neighboring subunits evoked by the ring is rectified anyway. By contrast, for spots placed at the overlap of subunits, the suppressive ring diminishes responses, as explained above, whereas a simple spot still leads to a strong response because the partially activated subunits do not receive any suppression and combine their activation to accumulate a strong integrated response. Thus, the suppressive ring effectively leads to a spatial sharpening of the subunits, such that they can be identified more clearly as hotspots in the model’s response. Yet, probing a receptive field with such hat stimuli would be inefficient for two reasons. Firstly, responses of a ganglion cell to an individual hat stimulus would likely be relatively weak and might not even reach spiking threshold, since only a small portion of the receptive field is activated. Secondly, the receptive field would have to be scanned point-by-point over two spatial dimensions requiring a large number of presentations at different locations. We thus extended the idea of the spatial sharpening of subunit responses by turning towards a tomographic version of the concept. If an extensive white stripe is flashed inside the receptive field ( Fig 1E, left ), the response of the model will reflect the combined receptive field intensity lying within the confines of the stripe. Accordingly, if multiple positions ( here 60 ) in the receptive field are probed by such a flashed stripe, the responses will represent a projection of the receptive field along the stripe’s orientation ( Fig 1E, right ). Similarly, if the profile of the stripe utilizes the same shape introduced before with an excitatory center band and suppressive sidebands ( Fig 1F, left ), the responses will represent a projection of the sharpened subunits ( Fig 1F, right ). In this way, the receptive field can be probed with a single stripe in one dimension, reducing the number of presentations needed to identify the layout of the subunits. To reconstruct the layout of the sub from the stripe responses, we use a tomographic reconstruction algorithm [35, 36], which is based on the Radon transform [37, 38]. The Radon transform of a 2D function f ( x, y ) is defined as the integral of f ( x, y ) along lines parallel to the y -axis, i.e., ∫∞ −∞ f ( x, y + t ) d t. The Radon transform of a 2D function f ( x, y ) is defined as the integral of f ( x, y ) along lines parallel to x -axis, i.e, ∫∞ −∞ f ( t, y + x ) d t The Radon of a 2D function f ( x, y ) is defined as the integral f ( x, y ) along lines parallel to both axes, i.e, ∫∞∞∞ f ( x + t, y + s ) d t d s The Radon of a 2 function f ( x, y ) is defined as the f ( x, y ) along lines parallel both axes, i.e ∫∞∞∞ f ( t + x, s + y ) d t d s The Radon of a 2 function ( x, y ) is defined the f along lines parallel both axes, i.e ∫∞∞ f ( x + t, y + s ) d t d s The Rad of a 2 function ( x, y ) is the f along parallel both axes, i ∫∞ f ( t + x, y + s ) d t d s The of a function f ( x, y ) is the along both axes, i ∫∞ f ( x + y + s ) d t d s The of f ( x, y ) is along axes, ∫ f ( x + y ) d t d s The f ( x ) is along, ∫ f t d s The f is along, ∫ d The Radon of a function f ( x, y ) is defined as the integral of f ( x, y along lines parallel to y -axis, i.e, ∫∞ f ( x, y + t ) d t The Rad of a function ( x, y ) is defined the integral of ( x, y along parallel to -axis, i.e ∫ f ( t, y + x ) d The of a function ( x, y is the integral along lines parallel both, i.e ∫ f ( x +, y ) t d The function ( x, is along parallel, ∫ f d The of function is along, ∫ The Radon transform of a 2D function f ( x, y ) is defined as the integral f ( x, y along lines parallel x -axis, i.e ∫∞ f ( t, y + x ) d t The Rad of a 2 function ( x, y is defined the integral along x -axis, i.e ∫ f ( y + x ) d The of 2 function ( x is along, ∫ The Radon of 2 function ( x, y is defined as integral along y -axis, i ∫ f ( x + y d The of 2 ( x is along, ∫ The Radon a function ( x, y is defined as along -axis, ∫ f The of ( x is along, ∫ The Radon a 2D function ( x, y is defined the integral along both axes, i.e ∫∞∞ f ( x +, y ) d

    Title: 
    Article: An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ). Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate. The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features. However, the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein. For essential genes, sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate. We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ). To capture this interaction, we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods. However, for noisier datasets, some of these methods generate far more significant interactions, likely including many false positives, whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision, which we observed in both empirical and simulated data. 
 CRISPR technology is becoming an increasingly important tool for genome-wide identification of gene functions in various environmental conditions [1–3]. For example, several different approaches have been devised to exploit CRISPR to induce depletion of target proteins. In the earlier CRISPRko approaches, a nuclease-active form of CAS9 was used to deactivate target genes by cutting the DNA at a target locus and induce DNA repair, which could introduce indels causing frameshifts or inserting novel elements, abrogating their function completely [1–3]. Another approach, CRISPRa, utilizes dCAS9 fusions with effectors that actively enhance or suppress transcription through direct interaction with the RNA polymerase ( such as transcription factors that can activate transcription ) [4]. In CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ), a catalytically-dead CAS9 protein ( dCAS9 ) is recruited to a chromosomal locus by a single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) with a short ( ~20 bp ) complimentary sequence and physically blocks transcription [5]. dCAS9 nucleases from several different organisms are available for CRISPRi ( e. g. S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, [6] ) and different promoters and chemicals have been used for dCAS9 induction. The degree of CRISPR interference can be tuned by modulating the level of dCAS9 expression [7], varying the sgRNA sequence with respect to its length, GC-content, targeting sequence complementarity, position in the gene, or similarity of targeted PAM ( protospacer adjacent motif ) sequence, to consensus for optimal dCAS9 recognition, [5, 6, 8–11]. While in mammalian systems, efficiency of sgRNAs can vary among multiple cell types, [9], for simplicity, our focus is on studying single defined lineages, as in bacterial strains. Tuning CRISPRi allows to deplete the targeted gene product to intermediate levels [5], which allowed the introduction of the concept of gene ‘vulnerability’ as describing the sensitivity of cells to partial depletion of individual proteins [12]. By this definition, highly vulnerable genes are genes for which even small depletion of the encoded protein causes growth impairment, which can be quantified efficiently on a genome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing [12]. The vulnerability of a gene can be both condition dependent and strain or cell type dependent [12]. One interesting application of CRISPRi is to reveal targets of antibiotics or mechanisms of resistance through chemical-genetic interactions ( CGI ) [7, 13]. CRISPRi libraries can be designed to contain multiple sgRNAs targeting each gene, resulting in a set of thousands of individual depletion mutants [12]. In this context, ‘mutant’ refers to a cell line transformed with a integrative plasmid capable of expressing the dCAS9 protein and the unique targeting sgRNA, even though it contains the wild-type gene sequence. The abundance of each mutant can be quantified by amplifying the sgRNA targeting sequence which functions as a molecular barcode, and then performing deep sequencing to count the number of barcodes for each sgRNA in a treatment [6]. The analysis of such datasets is challenging, due to various sources of noise which introduce variability in the counts. There are several previously published methods for statistical analysis of CRISPR datasets. One, called MAGeCK [14] ( originally intended for CRISPRko screens ), calculates a log-fold-change ( of mean counts ) for each sgRNA between a treatment condition and a reference condition ( control ), and uses a Gaussian distribution to estimate the significance of differences in mean sgRNA abundance between treatments and controls ( based on the implementation in the source code, which differs from the description in the publication ). To evaluate effects at the gene level, individual sgRNAs are combined in MAGeCK using Robust Rank Aggregation ( RRA ) to prioritize genes whose sgRNAs show greater enrichment or depletion on average than other genes in the genome. MAGeCK has been used for evaluating chemical-genetic interactions ( CGI ) with antibiotics [14]. A variant called MAGeCK-MLE [15] fits a Bayesian model by Maximum Likelihood that captures changes in mean counts with increasing time or concentration, along with effectiveness of each sgRNA through posterior probabilities of a binary variable, to determine the overall probability that a gene interacts. Other approaches such as CRISPhieRmix [16] use mixture models to separate effective from ineffective sgRNAs, and thereby identify interacting genes as those containing a significant subset of effective sgRNAs. DrugZ [17] identifies significant interactions by averaging together Z-scores ( assuming a Normal distribution ) of log-fold-changes of sgRNAs at the gene level. DEBRA [18] utilizes DeSeq, a method for transcriptomic analysis, which employs the Negative Binomial distribution for counts and a more sophisticated method for modeling variance and using it to discriminate genes displaying significant changes in mean counts. However, most of these methods have one of two limitations when applied to identify genes affecting drug potency. First, CGI experiments are ideally carried out with multiple drug concentrations around the MIC ( minimum-inhibitory concentration ), since it is often difficult to anticipate what concentration will stimulate the right amount of growth inhibition in combination with CRISPRi-induced depletion of target proteins. However, many of the existing methods analyze the data for each drug concentration independently ( i. e. comparing each concentration to a no-drug control ). Since knock-down mutants might exhibit depletion at one concentration but not others, results from multiple concentrations must be combined post-hoc. As an example, the authors in [13] chose to combine results from analyzing different concentrations of a given drug using MAGeCK-RRA by taking the union of significant interacting genes at each individual concentration. Due to the noise in these CRISPRi experiments, analyzing concentrations independently increases the risk of detecting false positives ( in the sense that non-interacting genes might be spuriously called as hits at different concentrations ). Second, many of the analytical methods do not explicitly take into account differences in sgRNA efficiency ( i. e. take sgRNA efficiencies as an input in the model ). Different sgRNAs can induce different degrees of depletion of their target genes, and this in turn causes different effects on growth rate, depending on sensitivity of the cells to protein depletion [10]. In this paper, we use sgRNA efficiency to refer to the overall effect on growth rate, because we do not assess the intermediate levels of protein depletion. This can be quantified beforehand by evaluating the growth rate of individual CRISPRi mutants ( with unique sgRNAs ) in a growth experiment and determining the actual fitness defect caused by target knockdown [11, 12]. In highly vulnerable genes, the effect of protein depletion by sgRNAs on cell growth rate ( efficiency ) can span a range from no effect to severe growth defect. Early applications of CRISPR were primarily being used to fully inactivate genes ( e. g. CRISPRko ), rather than to produce graded depletion effects. Therefore, at the time some of these methods were developed, this information was often not used, as methods to quantify sgRNA efficiencies were not well developed. Even in MAGeCK, the Robust Rank Aggregation method treats all sgRNAs in a gene as “equal” a priori, without differentiating them based on the expected effects on growth phenotype ( i. e. sgRNA efficiency is not an input ). In contrast, it has been recognized that different sgRNAs can have different efficiencies, and several papers have investigated the factors that are associated with stronger sgRNAs [19], [20]. However, the relationship between sgRNA efficiency and effect on growth is non-linear [10, 21]. For example, the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical method called CRPR-DR ( Dose-Response ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. We use CRPRDR to analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, which we show via CRPR for E. coli on different carbon sources. The performance is competitive with the best of several related methods, however, for noisier datasets some generate more interactions, likely false positives, whereas CRPR maintains higher precision in both empirical and simulated data.

    Title: 
    Article: Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks. 
 Gene co-expression networks inform our understanding of cell and organismal function by encoding associations between genes. Associations between expression levels can indicate common function, and the number of connections can point to central or regulatory genes [1]. Due to the large dimensionality of gene expression data, often composed of several thousands of gene expression measures, a major tool in the analysis of co-expression is gene clustering: separating the genes into related groups, which can then be explored separately [2]. This drastically reduces the number of genes we need to consider at the same time and allows for the identification of hubs or centrally connected genes that can be used to inform further experimental validation [3, 4]. The question is, given a co-expression network, how should we cluster the genes? The general idea behind several methods is to look for similar genes, as these are expected to be involved in related biological functions. However, several definitions of similarity have been used. The most basic measure of similarity borrows from classical morphological integration theory and attempts to find gene modules based on their correlations. In this context, genes in the same module are expected to be highly correlated and perform similar functions, while genes in different modules are expected to have low correlations [5–7]. Here, we refer to this classic pattern of higher within- than between-group correlation as assortativity, and to the groups as assortative modules. Other methods use the correlations to create other measures of similarity, which are then used as input to clustering algorithms. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis [WGCNA, 3] uses a power transformation of the correlation between gene expression ( or a topological similarity measure built with these transformed correlations ) [8, 9] as a similarity measure that is then separated into assortative modules using hierarchical clustering. One of the main objectives of WGCNA is finding hub genes, which have high connectivity within modules and are clearly identified by hierarchical clustering. Other methods borrow from network analysis and attempt to explicitly maximize the Newman Modularity [10] of the weighted gene network. For example, Modulated Modularity Clustering [MMC, 11] uses an adaptive algorithm to find a non-linear distance between genes based on their correlations that maximizes the number of modules uncovered by maximizing modularity. Although these methods differ in their definition of similarity, they all impose an assortative structure on the gene expression network, in which similar genes are expected to be more correlated with each other than with other genes. Clustering genes in tightly correlated modules aligns with the intuition that groups of genes performing similar functions should be highly correlated. However, imposing assortativity will necessarily ignore alternative organizations, if they exist, and could prevent us from fully understanding how transcriptional networks are organized. For example, Betzel et al. [12] provides several examples of network organization besides assortativity, like non-assortative networks, in which vertices have more edges to vertices between communities than within; or core-periphery, in which a central community is connected to other communities, but the peripheral communities are not internally connected ( Fig 1 ). These alternative architectures can also occur in the same network simultaneously [12, 13]. We currently lack the empirical information on how common these patterns are in gene co-expression data, simply because our widely applied methods are completely blind to them due to their exclusive focus on assortativity. Given that other biological networks, like neuronal networks [12, 14], exhibit clear evidence for these alternative organizations, there is no reason to think that a system as complex and as high-dimensional as the transcriptome should be limited to a single pattern of organization. To explicitly address this possibility of alternative organizations, we use a more general measure of similarity that allows us to find meaningful gene groups that are not necessarily assortative but still have clear biological interpretation. This approach is implemented in the weighted nested Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model [14, wnDC-SBM, or SBM for brevity, 15], which has shown promising results in similar applications [16, 17]. The SBM is different from other clustering methods in that it does not attempt to find assortative modules ( i. e., modules with higher within- than between-module correlation ). Instead, any information contained in the gene co-expression network can potentially be used to inform the clustering. Genes can be clustered together because they share similar patterns of connectivity to other genes, regardless of whether they are more strongly correlated with each other or with genes in other clusters. The word information here should be understood in the information theoretical sense: in the SBM, clusters are inferred so as to minimize the number of bits required to represent the network given the information about the clusters [18]. To be sure, the SBM can capture an assortative modular pattern if it is present, but it is general enough to also capture other network organizations [12, 19]. Furthermore, even if, in the context of the SBM, assortativity is not the main driver of gene partitioning, it can still be used to interpret the clusters we obtain. By measuring the modularity of the identified clusters, we can compare networks with respect to their modularity without the problem of comparing a measure that was maximized to find the clusters in the first place. This opens the possibility of an unbiased comparison of the degree of modularity in different transcriptional networks ( e. g., different cell types, tissues, species, etc. ), which is a question that remains unexplored so far. Here, using a multi-tissue RNAseq dataset from Drosophila melanogaster, we show first, that the SBM, a model with no free parameters, can find many more gene clusters than competing methods. Second, that such gene clusters are biologically meaningful, as revealed by highly specific gene ontology enrichment. Third, that biological meaning is not restricted to assortative modules as traditionally thought but extends to the non-assortative parts of the transcriptome. Our results highlight the importance of using clustering algorithms that don’t rely on assortativity metrics to explore the structure of transcriptomes in a comprehensive and unbiased manner. 
 Elsewhere [20], we quantified whole-genome gene expression in hundreds of outbred Drosophila melanogaster female flies using a high-throughput RNAseq library preparation protocol [TM3seq, 21]. To build the gene co-expression networks, here we use a subset of the full dataset that includes: samples for two tissues, head ( n = 212 ) and body ( n = 252 ), individuals with the best coverage ( average gene counts: head = 4. 65M, body = 4. 58M ), and genes with moderate to high expression ( average CPM > 5 and detected in every sample, head n = 5584 genes, body n = 5533 genes ). The expression matrices used to generate co-expression networks correspond to VOOM-transformed gene counts ( S1 Data ) [22] where the effect of known and unknown [23] covariates was removed using the function removeBatchEffect from the R package limma [22]. Details on the collection of RNAseq data, library preparation, and processing of raw RNAseq counts can be found in [20]. Using the gene expression measures for both tissues, we generate co-expression network graphs. In theory, we could proceed using a full network in which all pairs of genes are connected but fitting the SBM with this fully connected graph is computationally too onerous. Moreover, given the very large number of correlations being estimated, many of these estimates are likely to be spurious or noisy. To mitigate these issues, we reduce the connectivity of the network by imposing a stringent Benjamini-Hochberg ( BH ) false discovery rate ( FDR ) cut-off on the edges. This approach removes edges with a large p-value associated with the correlation between the corresponding genes, thus retaining only the most statistically significant correlations that we are more confident reflect true biological relationships. As edges are removed, some genes with only non-significant correlations become disconnected from the rest of the network and can be removed. By gradually reducing the FDR threshold, we reduce the density of the gene network while increasing the number of genes in the network. We use a range of FDR from 0. 01 to 0. 1 to generate a series of networks with varying density and number of genes. For each network, we apply the SBM to find clusters of genes. We compare the number of clusters found by the SBM with other methods that assume assortativity, WGCNA and MMC. The results are shown in Fig 2, where the SBM finds significantly more clusters than both WNA and MMC for all FDR thresholds. The number of clusters found by the SBM increases with decreasing FDR, while WNA and MMC remain relatively constant. This indicates that the SBM is more sensitive to the density of the network than the other methods. The clusters found by the SBM are biologically meaningful as shown in Fig 3, where we show the top 10 most enriched GO terms for each cluster. The enrichment is strong across all FDR thresholds, indicating that the clusters are robust to the density of the network. Furthermore, the enrichment is not restricted to assortative modules as shown in Fig 4, where we show the top 10 most enriched GO terms for non-assortative clusters. The enrichment of non-assort clusters is as strong as for assortative clusters, indicating that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought. The results highlight the importance of using clustering methods that don’t rely on assortativity to explore the structure of the transcriptome in a comprehensive and unbiased manner. In conclusion, we have shown that the SBM can find more gene clusters than methods that assume assortativity, that these clusters are biologically meaningful, and that the meaning is not restricted to assortative but extends to non-assort parts of the transcript. Our results suggest that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of structuring of co-expression networks. The SB can be used to compare the degree of modularity in different transcriptional networks ( e. g. different cell types, tissues, species, etc. ) which is a question remains unexplored so far. The SB can also be used to identify non-assort patterns in other biological networks, like neuronal networks, which have been shown to exist [12, 14]. Our results highlight the importance of using clustering algorithms that don’t rely on assortativity to explore the structure of biological networks in a comprehensive and unbiased manner.

    Title: 
    Article: Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC; Pab1 in yeast ) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail, we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome, as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome, in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. Collectively, our results indicate that, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins, elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation. 
 Eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to complex post-transcriptional regulation by RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) that control protein output. Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding proteins ( PABPCs ) are RBPs that bind polyadenylated tails at mRNA 3’-ends and subsequently play roles in multiple stages of cytoplasmic mRNA regulation, from translation initiation to termination and mRNA decay [1–3]. The numerous functions of PABPC are attributed to its ability to interact with not only mRNAs but also various other proteins to form messenger ribonucleoprotein ( mRNP ) complexes [2]. PABPC’s conserved structure consists of three regions: i ) four RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) domains, two of which ( RRM1 and RRM2 ) bind 12 adenosines with high affinity [3, 4], while the protein overall covers 27 adenosines [5], ii ) a proline-rich ( P ) linker domain, and iii ) a C-terminal mademoiselle ( MLLE ) domain that interacts with other proteins via their PABP-interacting motif 2 ( PAM2 ) [2, 3, 6]. Mammals have multiple isoforms of PABPCs, of which the most ubiquitous isoform as well as the most studied is PABPC1, whereas the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only one PABPC, Pab1 [2, 3, 6, 7]. The current model for general mRNA decay in yeast involves biphasic poly ( A ) tail shortening by Pan2-Pan3 and Ccr4-Not deadenylase complexes, decapping by the Dcp1/Dcp2 holoenzyme, and exonucleolytic Xrn1-mediated 5’-3’ degradation or exosome-mediated 3’-5’ degradation [3, 8, 9]. PABPC appears to have a paradoxical role in these processes. On the one hand, PABPC1/Pab1 stimulates deadenylation by recruiting Pan2-Pan3 to the poly ( A ) tail through its interaction with the PAM2 motif on Pan3 [1, 3, 8, 10, 11]. Consistent with this model, mRNAs in yeast cells harboring a deletion of PAB1 or mutations of Pab1’s C-terminal Pan3-interacting domain had longer poly ( A ) tails than their counterparts in wild-type cells [1–3, 12–14]. On the other hand, PABPC has been shown to protect mRNAs from exonucleases [3, 8]. Importantly, mRNAs with longer poly ( A ) tails are generally more stable and better translated than their short-tailed or un-tailed counterparts [3, 15–23], observations that led us to propose a role for PABPC in the enhancement of translation initiation by the possible formation of an mRNA “closed-loop” [23–25]. Current elaborations of this model postulate that mRNAs could be circularized by a chain of interactions between poly ( A ) -associated PABPC and 5’ end-localized initiation factors, giving rise to a poly ( A ) tail-PABPC-eIF4G-eIF4E-5’cap network [2, 26–30]. eIF4G has been shown to interact with PABPC’s RRM2 domain [26, 31–33], and disrupting this interaction reduced translation [6, 29, 34]. Thus, PABPC can stabilize the cap-binding complex and aid the recruitment of the 43S pre-initiation complex to the mRNA [2, 3, 35]. However, this closed-loop arrangement is not required for all mRNAs or all conditions, raising the question of how else 5’-3’ communication is facilitated or whether it is indeed a universal step [30, 36–39]. Depletion of PABPC1 in mammalian cells had minimal effects on transcriptome-wide translation efficiency [40, 41], suggesting that the stimulatory effect of PABPC on translation initiation may be restricted to circumstances where translation initiation efficiency is rate-limited. In addition to its interactions with initiation factors, PABPC also interacts with the release factor eRF3 via its PAM2 motif in metazoans and its P-C domains in yeast [2, 6, 42–45]. Translation termination involves stop codon recognition in the ribosomal A-site and nascent peptide release by eRF1, whose hydrolysis function and conformational change are stimulated by eRF3’s GTPase activity [46, 47]. PABPC is thought to enhance termination efficiency by promoting the recruitment of the eRF1-eRF3 release factor complex to the stop codon. The role of PABPC in termination is also inferred from: i ) the observation that tethering PABPC1 or Pab1 downstream of premature termination codons ( PTCs ) antagonized nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ), an mRNA decay pathway thought to be activated by the reduced termination efficiency of premature translation termination [48, 49] and ii ) the increased termination efficiency observed with proximity of a stop codon to the mRNA 3’ end [50, 51]. Direct evidence for PABPC’s ability to enhance termination includes: i ) addition of PABPC1 to an in vitro termination assay improved termination efficiency [52], ii ) PABP-interacting protein PAIP1 and PAIP2 competed with eRF3 for free PABPC binding, reducing termination efficiency of PTCs in vitro [53], and iii ) deletion of PAB1 or Pab1’s P-C domains in vivo increased stop codon readthrough efficiency of reporter PTCs in a proximity-dependent manner [51]. However, as with initiation, a full understanding of PABPC’s role during termination of endogenous mRNAs in vivo is still lacking. PABPC’s involvement in many major stages of mRNA regulation and translation complicate attempts to define a specific role for PABPC in vivo by deleting, depleting, overexpressing, or mutating the protein and have led to conflicting models of PABPC’s function. Therefore, to specifically assess direct and indirect consequences of deleting PABPC, we generated and analyzed mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and ribosome profiling [54] data from yeast cells lacking Pab1. As expected, protein and mRNA abundance changed substantially in pab1Δ cells. We found that deleting PAB1 resulted in a translation termination defect that appears to be at least partially due to reduced eRF3 protein level as well as to loss of Pab1’s stimulatory function on termination. In addition, translation initiation defects and changes in relative translation efficiency in pab1Δ cells may be confounded by reduced initiation factor levels, especially eIF4G and eIF1. Further, an analysis of decapping activator substrates revealed that increased levels of certain mRNA subgroups may be partially caused by reduced levels of a specific decapping activator or components of Ccr4-Not deadenylation complex. Together, our results catalog the consequences of PAB1 deletion and illustrate the complexity of Pab1’s pleiotropic effects on the transcriptome-wide regulation of translation and mRNA decay. 
 To investigate proteome- and transcriptome-wide abundance changes when Pab1 is absent, we performed mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and ribosome profiling analyses of yeast cells harboring a PAB1 deletion. Because PAB1 is an essential gene, the deletion was created in a pbp1Δ background, which suppresses pab1Δ lethality [55], and we used the PAB1/pbp1Δ strain as our wild-type PAB1 control. Proteomic and transcriptomic data obtained from three biological replicates of each strain were reproducible, as evidenced by high Pearson’s correlation coefficients between replicates ( S1 Fig ). Differential expression analyses were performed for mass spectrometry and RNA-Seq data using DESeq2 [56, 57] and edgeR [58], respectively, while ribosome profiling data were analyzed using Ribo-seq [59]. We found that p1Δ cells exhibited significant changes in the proteome and transcriptome compared to P1/p1 cells ( Fig 2A, B ), with 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

    Title: 
    Article: Slow brain rhythms, for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing. They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms, involving synaptic interactions and delays, or from intrinsically bursting neurons. Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability. It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can, therefore, contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and, potentially, inform therapeutic strategies. 
 Rhythms on diverse timescales are a hallmark of our brain’s activity. Such oscillatory activity is associated with physiological states, ranging from normal breathing to the consolidation of memories, or pathological situations such as epileptic seizures and spreading depolarization ( SD ) [1–5]. Some rhythms are orders of magnitude slower than single-neuron spiking. For these, different mechanistic origins of their slow dynamics have been proposed. First, a neuron’s embedding in the network can produce bursts via reverberating activity, with synaptic delays serving as an important parameter that determines the period of the resulting oscillations [6]. Second, one or more cells with intrinsically bursting dynamics can act as pacemakers [7] and entrain larger networks. Combinations of both of the above mechanisms, network effects and intrinsic bursting, have also been reported [8]. Along these lines, brain regions that exhibit large-scale oscillatory behaviour often contain significant numbers of single-neuron bursters [9–11], fostering network entrainment via pacemaker neurons [2]. Theoretical and experimental research suggests that the neuron’s ability to generate bursts of activity intrinsically arises from the expression of specific ion channels, such as hyperpolarization-activated inward transient potassium channels or calcium-dependent channels [2, 12–14]. The kinetics of these channels form the basis of the slow dynamics. Ion channels with dedicated slow kinetics, however, are not the only single-cell mechanism that can generate rhythms on long timescales. Specifically, an interplay between concentration dynamics and membrane dynamics has been shown to give rise to slow oscillations [15–17]. Here, we explore in detail how the combination of slower, pump-dependent extracellular potassium concentration dynamics with the faster spike generating dynamics can generate slow oscillations. We analyse the bifurcation structure in a minimalistic model, focussing on the role of the Na+/K+-ATPase. The minimalistic burst mechanism is based on a hysteresis loop arising from the feedback of the fast spiking dynamics to the slower concentration-dominated dynamics; the bistability arises in the fast subsystem [9, 18, 19]. We argue that via this mechanism, in principle, any class I nerve cell can be switched into an intrinsic burster even in the absence of channels with slow dynamics. For the proposed mechanism two facts are combined: ( 1 ) All neuron models that can produce arbitrarily slow firing rates ( class I excitable neurons [20, 21] ) share the necessary fundamental bifurcation structure [19, 22] and can be tuned into a bistable regime ( where a stable fixed point and a limit-cycle co-exist ) [23–25]. Alternating between the two stable states in the bistable regime is the basis of the deterministic bursting mechanism. ( 2 ) The electrogenic and concentration-dependent Na+/K+-pump can transform the fundamental bifurcation structure such that a hysteresis loop in a concentration dimension can form under physiological conditions. The slow rhythm produced by this mechanism is expressed both at the level of neuronal spiking and ionic concentrations. It does require neither ion channels with slow dynamics nor rhythmic input via the neuronal network. In the following, we first introduce a model exemplifying the proposed generic mechanism of slow deterministic bursting. Next, the mechanism is analysed by dissecting the slow and fast dynamics ( here also termed the slow-fast method ) [26]. Based on numerical continuation, the bifurcations in the fast subsystem are identified and the existence of a slow hysteresis loop mechanism is demonstrated. Finally, the conditions for which the model can be tuned into the slow bursting regime or other dynamics such as depolarization block and tonic spiking are discussed by analysis of the bifurcations in the complete system. Taken together, this study highlights the ubiquitous nature of the mechanism by which extracellular potassium dynamics and Na+/K+-ATPase can induce slow rhythms in single neurons and beyond. 
 In order to study the emergence of slow rhythmic activity via the interactions of fast spiking and slow concentration dynamics ( i. e., fast and slow subsystems, respectively. see next sections ), a neuron model equipped with only basic fast spike-generating ion channels is placed in an external environment of fixed volume that contains extracellular potassium ions, whose concentration, [K+]out, can change ( Fig 1 ). The interplay between concentration dynamics and neuronal voltage dynamics is modulated by the Na+/K+-ATPase in two-fold manner: First, the pump current directly affects the voltage dynamics. Second, the pump changes concentration gradients which, in turn, alter ionic reversal potentials. It will be shown in the subsequent section that this parsimonious setup suffices to create slow rhythms. The neuron model, inspired by the Wang-Buzsáki model, comprises four currents: The depolarising Na+-current and repolarising K+-current are part of the spike-generating mechanism. A leak current balances the membrane potential in the rest state. For completing our model, we add a fourth current as a hyperpolarising pump current ( Ip ). This pump extrudes three Na+ ions out of the cell while two K+ ions are pumped in. The pump maintains the ionic gradient of the cell, which drives spiking activity. The activity of the pump is regulated by the extracellular potassium concentration, with higher [K+]out resulting in increased pump strain ( Eq 7 ). However, the pump’s activity is limited by its maximum current capacity ( Imax ), which is influenced by both the electrophysiology characteristic of the pump and its density on the neuron’s membrane. For the mathematical details, see Methods. With each action potential, K+ ions flow out of the cell through the voltage-dependent K+ channels and accumulate in the extracellular space. The elevated extracellular potassium concentration ( [K+]out ), in turn, not only affects the pump current but also influences the neuron’s excitability state via its effect on the reversal potential. Therefore, the dynamics undergoes a sequence of transitions, which form the basis for the rhythmic bursting behaviour and are explained and analysed in more detail in the following sections. In this section, we first provide a brief illustrative description of the generic burst mechanism, leaving a detailed analysis of the conditions for its existence to the following sections. An example trace of voltage and potassium concentration, respectively, for the slow bursting dynamics in a dedicated extracellular volume is depicted in Fig 2A. Each burst cycle contains two alternating states: quiescence and spiking. The rhythmicity of the voltage shows an inter-burst period of about one second. This period is about 30 times longer than the dynamics of one complete action potential in the spiking phase. The number of spikes per burst is fixed ( i. e., bursting is deterministic ). The basic cycle undergone during a burst is summarised in Fig 2B. The burst relies on the bistable nature of the neuron’s dynamics between spiking and quiescence. During the spiking period, the outward flow of potassium ions is considerable. The inter-spike interval does not provide sufficient time for the Na+/K+-ATPase to pump back all K+ ions that left the cell during the spike. Consequently, K+ ions accumulate in the extracellular space, resulting in a saw-tooth-like build-up of [K+]out ( Fig 2B, spiking phase ). Furthermore, during the spiking phase of each burst, the inter-spike interval progressively prolongs as a result of K+ accumulation in the extracellular space. Eventually, the rise of [K+]out reaches a level where spiking is not possible anymore ( the quiescent phase ). Spiking is terminated by a homoclinic bifurcation ( HOM ) in the fast subsystem, indicated by the blue circle in Fig 2B. In the quiescent phase, the pump activity now suffices to reduce extracellular potassium, as shown by the decrease in [Kout] in Fig 2B. The neuron is now ready for the next spiking phase. The cycle is repeated until the pump’s maximum capacity is reached, at which point the neuron is silenced by depolarisation block (DB ). The mechanism of bursting is thus based on the interplay between fast spiking and slow dynamics, with the Na+/K+-Pase playing a crucial role in the bistability of the neuron’s dynamics. The bistability arises from the feedback of the fast spiking to the slow dynamics, as shown in the bifurcation structure of the fast subsystem in Fig 3A. The hysteres loop in the fast subsystem is the basis for the bistability of the neuron’s dynamics. The bistability in the fast subsystem arises from a saddle-node bifurcation SN in the fast subsystem, as shown in the bifurcation diagram Fig 3A. The hyst loop in the fast subsystem is the basis for the bistability of the neuron’s dynamics. The bistability in the fast subsystem arises from a saddle-node bifurcation in the fast, as shown in bifurcation Fig 3. The hyst loop in the fast is the basis for bistability of the neuron’s dynamics. The bistability in the fast arises from a saddle bifurcation in the fast, shown bifurcation Fig 3.

    Title: 
    Article: Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. 
 Clustering algorithms are often used in omics studies to identify groups of patients sharing similar molecular patterns. The underlying assumption is that these patient subgroups may represent novel disease subtypes with possibly different survival outcomes or differential response to various treatments [1, 2]. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing has enabled clustering analysis across multiple omics layers like gene-expression, DNA-methylation, and somatic mutations to define disease subtypes. However, the high dimensionality of omics data makes generating relevant patient groupings extremely challenging for heterogeneous diseases like cancer. Popular methods often adopt an entirely data-driven approach, which, while important, could be improved by incorporating pathway information, particularly in fields like cancer biology. This integration may result in more interpretable clustering outcomes with enhanced prognostic relevance. However, although many pathway-based multi-view clustering methods have emerged recently, they have yet to be systematically compared with their data-driven counterparts. Moreover, current benchmarking studies do not provide a computational platform for testing and comparing multi-view clustering methods on novel datasets, allowing for the selection of the best clustering methods based on stability and other relevant metrics, nor do they permit access to both existing and novel pathway-based methods, thereby highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. Furthermore, these studies lack a multi-objective approach that could effectively evaluate which methods offer the best trade-off between clustering metrics. Here, we present COPS ( Clustering algorithms for Omics-driven Patient Stratification and robust evaluation of clustering results ) an R package that provides quick access to a unique compendium of state-of-the-art clustering methods for single- and multi-omic data as well as a robust pipeline to evaluate the reproducibility and prognostic value of clustering results in addition to standard clustering metrics. S1 Fig provides a visual representation of the computational framework proposed for subtyping omics profiles, whether in a single- or multi-omics context. Within multi-omics methods, the most promising are so called intermediate integration methods which aim to analyze multi-view data in a holistic manner rather than analyzing each view separately or concatenating all features before applying machine learning. These methods, encompassing joint Dimensionality Reduction ( jDR ) techniques as well as similarity network fusion algorithms followed by clustering analysis, have been reviewed extensively over the past few years without a clear winner emerging [2–9]. However, an important category of algorithms, those founded on pathway- or network-driven approaches, has been absent from previous reviews. The integration of biological knowledge such as gene-networks and pathway gene sets with omics data has been underutilized in multi-omics-driven patient stratification. Several methods to integrate biological knowledge into multi-omics integration have been developed while only few have been reviewed [10]. Significantly, COPS stands out by offering several pathway-based, single- and multi-omics clustering methods. These methods are rooted in the core principle of transforming omics-level features into pathway or network-based information. For multi-omics, COPS offers the implementation of existing and novel algorithms that combine patient omics profiles with pre-existing biological knowledge networks. These methodologies leverage a graph kernel approach after mapping each omic data layer onto genes, and subsequently onto pathways [11, 12]. We also implemented a novel pathway kernel that utilizes betweenness node centrality in pathway graphs to weight features when computing patient similarities, which yielded higher clustering stability compared to other similar methods. We also define a variant that uses the Random Walk with Restart algorithm to assess whether two patients have molecular feature alterations in close proximity within a given pathway, similar to the approach described in [12]. Kernel methods are in general an appealing choice since they are efficient for high-dimensional data with small sample sizes and they allow the separation of knowledge integration and machine learning algorithms to different steps. Moreover, within COPS, we also provide a variant of the spectral clustering algorithm which uses a QR-decomposition based algorithm [13] instead of k-means to potentially improve stability of previous pathway kernel clustering approaches. S1 Table comprehensively enumerates the full range of methods and functionalities offered by COPS. The present study aims, however, to demonstrate the effectiveness of COPS in benchmarking multi-view clustering methods to categorize cancer patients based on multi-omics profiles. It also intends to evaluates our two new pathway graph kernels, respectively termed BWK and RWR-BWK, which may be better suited for clustering analysis than previous pathway graph kernels. While previous research has used metrics like ARI or F1-score to assess clustering accuracy, and survival analysis with the log-rank tests between clusters or proportional-hazards regression models using latent variables to assess the prognostic significance of cancer subtypes, they often overlooked critical factors. Notably, many comparative analyses of multi-view clustering in cancer research did not adjust survival analyses for covariates like age or cancer stage, which limits the relevance of the predictions. Moreover, the importance of subsampling in evaluating clustering metrics and stability has not been sufficiently explored in the multi-omic context. COPS addresses these gaps by integrating repeated subsampling assessments of clustering metrics, such as ARI, survival, and stability, and by considering trade-offs between them. It uses the Pareto optimal criterion to find all clustering solutions that optimally balance different metrics, highlighting solutions where ( by selecting a different method or number of clusters ) no one objective can be improved without expending another. This holistic approach provides a more robust comparison of multi-view clustering algorithms. 
 COPS was employed to identify subtypes for seven types of cancer, namely kidney, breast, prostate, thyroid, ovarian, lung, and brain cancer, using four different types of omics data: mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and copy-number variants. Fig 1 visually represents the comparative studies conducted, while Table 1 consolidates the number of omics profiles, selected gold-standard subtypes, and the type of survival assessed for each benchmarked cancer dataset. Additionally, S2 Fig provides a graphical illustration of the cross-validation based subsampling framework. Samples with missing or ambiguous labels ( e. g., “other” ) were omitted from gold-standard agreement evaluation but were included in the clustering analysis. To evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms, we selected nine methods from COPS, including two joint dimensionality reduction methods ( MOFA and integrative non-matrix factorization ) [14, 15], a network-based method ( Affinity Network Fusion ) [16], a statistical-based method ( iCluster+ ) [17], Multiple Kernel K-Means with Matrix induced Regularization ( MKKM-MR ) paired with linear kernels and four different pathway graph kernel based methods including Pathway Induced Kernel ( PIK ) [11], PAthway MultiOmic Graph Kernel ( PAMOGK ) [12] as well as a novel Betweenness Weighted Kernel ( BWK ) and its variant RWR-BWK which applies an additional random-walk-with-restart procedure. These graph kernels utilize known biological pathways that were extracted from KEGG [18] or the National Cancer Institute Nature Pathway Interaction Database [19]. The proposed benchmark aims to evaluate the trade-offs between the statistical significance of survival analysis and the stability of clustering results for different numbers of clusters k, thereby simulating a discovery process for novel cancer subtypes. As a further evaluation strategy, we compare the clustering accuracies while using the number of gold-standard subtypes for k. Regarding hyperparameter tuning, we followed the precedent set by similar studies by using the default parameters of the available methods [7, 9]. However, to reduce feature count for data-driven methods, we systematically applied a high-variance gene filter, a recommended feature selection step for factorization-based methods like iCluster+ and MOFA2. The pre-processing steps including the mapping of omics features to genes and the subsequent filtering procedure are detailed in the Materials and Methods section. Previous benchmarking studies have primarily focused on the accuracy of clustering algorithms and the significance of survival differences between groups. However, the stability of the clustering results has not been extensively evaluated. We used the ARI score to assess the stability of clustering across different runs of the same data. The ARI is a measure of similarity between two clusterings that ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates identical clusterings and 0 indicates no similarity. The ARI was computed for each method and number of clusters k. We also used Cox proportional-haz regression models to assess the prognostic significance of subtypes, adjusting for relevant covariates like age and cancer stage. To evaluate the robustness of the results, we repeated the analysis 10 times with different random subsampling of the same data. The results are presented as boxplots of the median and interquartile range of the ARI and hazard ratios for each method and number of clusters. We found that Affinity Network, Integrative Non Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival in several studies.

    Title: 
    Article: Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group. C. elegans contains a sole SoxC protein, SEM-2. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development, and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. First, SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Second, in addition to specifying the SM fate, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Finally, SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Furthermore, our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. 
 Metazoan development is characterized by the specification and diversification of multipotent cells, as well as the proper organization of their differentiated descendants. These processes require well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. The C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage, offers a unique model system to dissect the underlying regulatory logic of cell fate specification and diversification. The M lineage is derived from a single multipotent precursor cell, the M mesoblast [1]. During hermaphrodite postembryonic development, the M mesoblast cell undergoes stereotypical divisions to produce fourteen striated body wall muscles ( BWMs ), two non-muscle coelomocytes ( CCs ), and two multipotent sex myoblasts ( SMs ) that subsequently proliferate to produce sixteen sex muscles—four type I and four type II vulval muscles ( vm1s and vm2s ), as well as four type I and four type II uterine muscles ( um1s and um2s ) —that are required for egg laying ( Fig 1A–1B ). Previous studies have identified multiple transcription factors and signaling components essential for the proper development of the M lineage [2]. In particular, LIN-12/Notch signaling is known to function upstream of the single C. elegans SoxC protein, SEM-2, to specify the SM fate in the ventral M lineage, while the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9 antagonizes BMP signaling to specify the M lineage-derived CC ( M-CC for short ) fate in the dorsal side [3–6]. SMA-9 functions by activating the expression of the sole FoxF/C transcription factor in C. elegans, LET-381, in the M-CC mother cells. LET-381 then directly activates the expression of the Six homeodomain transcription factor, CEH-34, where LET-381 and CEH-34 function in a feedforward manner to directly activate the expression of genes required for CC differentiation and function [7, 8]. At the same time, SMA-9 and LET-381 are each known to repress the expression of sem-2 in the dorsal side of the M lineage to prevent it from specifying the SM fate [6]. In addition to the factors described above that are important for proper fate specification in the M lineage, the sole C. elegans Twist ortholog, HLH-8, is known to function in proper patterning of the M lineage. HLH-8 is a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor that is expressed in the undifferentiated cells of the M lineage through regulatory elements located in the promoter, and it is expressed in the vulval muscles by autoregulation through E boxes located in its first intron [9, 10]. HLH-8 is known to have multiple functions during M lineage development: proper cleavage orientation of M lineage cells, proper proliferation of the SMs, and proper differentiation and function of the vulval muscles [11, 12]. In this study, we provide new insight into the relationships between various factors important in M lineage development and the sole SoxC transcription factor SEM-2. SoxC proteins are Sry-related HMG box ( Sox ) -containing transcription factors that are known to play critical roles in multiple developmental processes [13]. There are three highly conserved SoxC proteins in vertebrates, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12. Abnormal expression or function of SoxC factors has been linked to a variety of developmental disorders and cancers [13–18]. In particular, mutations in Sox4 and Sox11, most of them being point mutations in the HMG box, are associated with a developmental disorder called Coffin-Siris syndrome ( CSS ) [19–21]. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. We identified a new allele of sem-2, jj152, which is a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid change in a highly conserved residue at the end of the DNA-binding domain of SEM-2. We present genetic evidence showing that this single amino acid change results in a partial loss of SEM-2 function. By analyzing the M lineage phenotypes of jj152 mutants, we uncovered an unexpected role of SEM-2 in the dorsal M lineage, where SEM-2 functions antagonistically at the level of expression and function with LET-381 in CC specification. We also found that SEM-2 regulates the expression of hlh-8, possibly directly, in the SMs, and that SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and the diversification of the SMs. Our work uncovered new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development, some of which are likely conserved in other species, and we add to the general understanding of the functions and structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. 
 C. elegans strains used in this study were maintained at 20°C under normal culture conditions [22]. Analyses of hlh-8 reporters in sem-2 ( jj152 ), sem-2 ( jj321 ), sem-2 ( jj382 jj417 ) and sem-2 ( jj476 ) were performed at 25°C unless specifically noted. All strains are listed in S1 Table. Epifluorescence and differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy was conducted on a Leica DMRA2 compound microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca-ER camera using the iVision software ( Biovision Technology ). Subsequent image analysis was performed using Fiji [23]. For comparison of fluorescence intensities in different genetic backgrounds, images were collected at the same magnification and exposure. Statistical significance was determined by performing unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests or ANOVA with Dunnett’s test using Prism10 ( https://www. graphpad. com/features ). Raw data for all statistical analysis are available in S1 Data. sem-2 ( jj152 ) was isolated in a large-scale sma-9 ( cc604 ) Susm screen ( suppression of the sma-9 ( cc604 ) M lineage defect ) for the restoration of M-derived CCs in sma-9 ( cc604 ) mutants [5]. The sma-9 ( cc604 ) allele is a nonsense mutation that is considered a genetic null [24] and referred to as sma-9 ( 0 ). jj152 was mapped to chromosome I using the whole genome sequencing approach described in Liu et al. [5]. Because jj152 animals are egg-laying defective ( Egl ), we performed complementation tests between jj152 and each of the two previously studied sem-2 alleles, n1343 and ok2422 [6]. All jj152/n1343 trans-heterozygotes are Egl, but they did not exhibit the Susm phenotype. To perform a complementation test between jj152 and ok2422, hT2[bli-4 ( e937 ) let-? ( q782 ) qIs48 ( myo-2p::gfp; pes-10p::gfp; ges-1p::gfp ) ] ( I;III ) /jj152 ( I ) ; jjIs3900 ( hlh-8p::NLS::mCherry::lacZ + myo-2p::mCherry ) ( IV ) /+; sma-9 ( 0 ) ( X ) males were mated with hT2[bli-4 ( e937 ) let-? ( q782 ) qIs48 ( myo-2p::gfp; pes-10p::gfp; ges-1p::gfp ) ] ( I;III ) /sem-2 ( ok2422 ) ( I ) ; sma-9 ( 0 ) ( X ) hermaphrodites. Red, non-green jjIs3900 ( hlh-8p::NLSm::Cherrylac + my-2::mCherry ) males were observed in the progeny, indicating that jj152 and ok2 do not complement each other. jj152 is therefore a loss-of-function allele of sem-2. To determine the extent of sem-2 loss-of-function, we examined the expression of hl-8 in sem- (152 ) and sem- ( ok2 ) animals. hl-8 is expressed in SMs in wild-type and sem-2 animals but not in sem- (152 or sem- ok2 animals ( Fig 2A–B ). This suggests that SEM-2 is required for the expression of hl-8 in SMs. To determine if SEM-2 regulates hl-8 directly, we examined the expression of hl-8 reporters in sem- (152 and sem- ( ok ) animals ( Fig 2C–D ). hl-8 reporters are expressed in SM in wild-type and sem-2 but not in sem- ( or sem- ok animals. This indicates that SEM-2 regulates hl-8 in SM. To determine if SEM-2 is required for proliferation and diversification of SM, we counted the number of SMs in sem- ( ) and sem ( ) animals ( Fig 3A–B ). The number of SMs in sem- is significantly lower than in sem- or sem- animals. This indicates that SEM- is required for the proliferation and diversification of SM. To determine if SEM- antagonizes LET-381, we examined the expression of LET- in sem- ( and sem ) animals ( Fig 4A–B ). LET- is expressed in CC in wild-type and sem- but not in sem- or sem animals. This indicates that SEM- antagonizes LET- in CC. To determine if SEM- is required for proper patterning of the lineage, we examined the expression of hl-8 in sem- and sem animals ( Fig 5A–B ). hl-8 is expressed in SM in wild and sem- but not sem or sem animals. This indicates that SEM is required for patterning of the lineage. To determine if SEM- regulates hl- directly, we examined the expression of hl- reporters in sem- and sem ( Fig 6A–B ). hl- reporters are expressed in SM in wild and sem but not sem or sem animals. This indicates that SEM regulates hl- in SM. To determine if SEM is required for proliferation and diversification of SM, we counted the number of SM in sem and sem animals ( Fig 7A–B ). The number of SM in sem is lower than in sem or sem animals. This indicates that SEM is required for proliferation and diversification of SM. To determine if SEM antagonizes LET-, we examined the expression of LET in sem and sem animals ( Fig 8A–B ). LET is expressed in CC in wild and sem but not sem or sem. This indicates that SEM antagonizes LET in CC. To determine if SEM is required for patterning the lineage, we examined the expression of hl- in sem and sem ( Fig 9–B ).- is expressed in SM in wild and sem but sem animals. indicates that SEM is required pattering the lineage.
