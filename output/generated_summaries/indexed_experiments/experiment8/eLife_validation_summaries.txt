In C. elegans, GL-1 Notch signaling is crucial for maintaining undifferentiated stem/progen cells in the germline. Unexpectedly, GL-1 Notch also promotes cell reprogramming. To understand this phenomenon, researchers identified genes activated by increased GL-1 Notch signaling. Identified genes include physiological GL-1 targets, sy-1 and lst-1, and others, such as ut-1, weakly or not expressed in the distal region of wild-type gonads. Wild-type GL-1ch levels are insufficient to induce ut- expression, which is controlled by additional mechanisms, like lip- mRNA degradation in the distal gon. GL-1ch has a lesser role in germ differentiation. Some Not-activated genes promote differentiation, explaining proposed differentiation-promoting GL- function. Not- genes are repressed by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), suggesting interplay between extracellular Not signaling and intrinsic chromatin modifier PR2. In ut-1, PR2 prevents inappropriate expression in distal gon, overcome by increased GL- Not signaling. Researchers found GL-1 antagonizes PR2, partly by stimulating histone demethylase UTX-1, essential for reprogramming. UTX1 influences germl by germl-autonomous function, not somatic function. UTX orthologs in species contribute tissue signatures, like myogenesis, cardiac development, and germ/somatic reprogramming. ChIP was used to assess UTX1 binding to GL-1 target sites. UTX1 is a transcriptional target of GL-1 signaling. GL- and PR2 interact genetically, affecting ut- expression. UTX demethylates histone H3K27, repressing PR2. GL-1 and PR2 have antagonistic effects on ut- expression. GL-1 promotes reprogramming in PR2-compromised gonads. UTX1 is required for reprogramming, partly by demethylating H3K27. UTX demethylase JM-1.2 is also required for reprogramming, demethylating H9 and H27. UTX and JM-2 demethylate histones, repressing PR. GL-1 and PR2 interact, affecting ut- expression. GL-1 and PR2 have antagonistic effects on ut- expression. GL- promotes reprogramming in PR-compromised gon. UTX is required for reprogramming partly demethyl H27. U demethylase JM-2 is also required reprogramming demethyl H9 and H27. U and JM demethyl histones repress PR. GL- and PR interact affecting ut expression GL- and PR have antagonistic on ut.
SK2, a cytosolic adaptor protein, plays a crucial role in host defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia) infection in the hematopoietic compartment. In a murine model of lung infection, SK2 is indispensable for K. pneumonia-stimulated neutrophil ROS production, but not degranulation or phagocytosis, suggesting the increased bacterial burden in Sk2/-mice is affected by loss of ROS. Sensitivity of K. pneumonia to ROS is supported by increased bacterial burden in Cy/- mice during lung infection and observations in Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CG) patients. In murine neutils, SK is required for full phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFs), spleen tyrosine kinase (Sy), and proline tyrosine kinase 2 (Py2), demonstrating a critical role in K pneumonia-induced pathways required for ROS production. Consistent with previous findings, K. pneumonia 16 is resistant to internalization, indicating phocyt is likely not primary mechanism provided by neutils to this strain. Studies, including K. 16, have shown degran of myeloperoxidase, neutil elastase, and cathepsin are important for reducing burden of K pneumonia in mice. However, we found equivalent EL2 degran in Sk/-ice was not sufficient to control K pneumonia burden in absence of ROS, indicating neutil ROS and degran may cooperate in containing K pneumonia infection. Since degran occurred normally in Sk/-ungs, pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling regulating degran in murine neutils after pneumonia infection. Neutils and ROS contribute to defense other pathogens, such as Yersinia pseuduberculosis, Staphlococcus aureus, Candida albicans, among others. Immunological mechanisms SK-mediated neutil responses to other pathogens are under investigation. A model for SK-dependent neutil response to K pneumonia in mice is proposed based on findings and others. Following K pneumonia infection, activation of receptors, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leads to phosphoinosit 3 (PI3) and phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP) generation, resulting in PIP-mediated SK activation and membrane localization. Activated SK can bind and phosphorylate SFs, shifting active/inactive equilibrium to active, leading to Sy activation. This is supported by biochemical and pull-down studies showing SK can interact with SFs. SF and Sy may associate and activate Py2, observed in response to GPC, integrin, TN, or Salmonella stimulation. SK may interact with Py2 complex or indirectly through association with Sirp. These mechanisms promote stabilization and propagation SF/Sy2 phosphorylation in murine neutil leading ROS. SF, Sy, and Py have been important for degran in murine and human neutils, but observed low levels in murine lungs and neutils after pneumonia in vitro. Low may be sufficient to induce degran through SK-independent pathway or specific phosphorylation sites not tested. Different domains Py regulate ROS and degran. Inhibition carbox-terminus Py in human neutils reduces ROS response TN, Salmon, Lister, but not neutil degran and killing. SK may impact carbox-termin Py in murine neutils, not activation other domains. Sk/- have normal circulating neutils and Sk/-neutils present in pneumonia-infected lungs at similar, sometimes higher than WT neutils. Prior studies revealed Sk/-myoid, including neutils, impaired recruitment and migration into tissues during sterile inflammation, suggesting migration to sterile but not infectious sites require SK, consistent with Sy. Alternatively, possible Sk/-neutils reduced migration in pneumonia-infected lungs balanced by higher rate neutil survival, resulting net neutil equivalent to WT. This could arise ROS increase myel cell death, contributing higher accumulation infected
A mathematical model of the contribution of the hypnoite reservoir to Plasmodium viv transmission was developed and validated against data from tropical strains of P. viv. The within-host model of liver-stage hypites was embedded in a P. viv transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypite death. The hypite reservoir was predicted to be over-dispersed with individuals having few or no hypites and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypites were predicted to experience relapses and contribute to P. viv transmission. Incorporating hypite-killing drugs such as prima into first-line treatment regimens was predicted to cause substantial reductions in P viv transmission, as individuals with the most hypites are likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

The study built on existing Ross-Macald models of malaria transmission, which describe the dynamics of a pathogen between human and vector hosts. However, these models do not account for the reservoir of dormant stages in the liver, which is crucial for P. viv transmission. The within-host model of hypites in the liver was developed to explain the patterns of rel infections, which are a defining characteristic of P viv biology. The model was integrated into a P viv transmission model to demonstrate the impact of the hyp reservoir on transmission.

The model was validated against data from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P viv: South America, East Asia, and Melanesia. The number of hypites in the liver was correlated with the time to first relapse, and the activation rate of hypites was estimated. The model was extended to temperate strains of P viv, assuming a period of dormancy before activation. The model was embedded in a P transmission model between humans and mosquitoes, driven by transmission through bites and reling hypites to new-stage infections.

The model was fitted to data on time to first relapse from individuals exposed to P viv, mostly in the absence of new infections. The likelihood of the model was evaluated by applying it to the data. The parameters were estimated using a Bayesian framework, with informative priors for the number of hypites, activation rate, and death. The posterior distributions were estimated using a Metropolis-Hast Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

The model predicted that the hyp reservoir is over-dispersed, with individuals having few or no hypites and some intensely infectedivers. Individuals with more hypites were predicted to relapse and contribute to P transmission. Incorporating hyp-killing drugs into treatment was predicted to reduce transmission, as individuals with most hyp are likely to relapse and be targeted. The model provides insights into the dynamics of P viv transmission and the impact of interventions.
Carbon dynamics following disturbance by selective logging in Amazonian forests were studied using a network of 133 permanent plots across the Amazon and Guiana. The study found that 2ha of Amazon forests are disturbed by selective logging each year, emitting 90g of carbon to the atmosphere, which is balanced by forest regrowth. A model calibrated on the network of plots, regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass were linked to Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging carbon recovery. Above-ground recovery over 10 years was higher in the Guiana Shield (21 Mg ha-1) than in the south (12 Mg-1) where environmental stress is high. Survivors played a key role in regrowth and a comprehensive map of post-disturbance recovery in Amazon was elaborated. Climate change draws attention to impacts of human activities on carbon cycles, particularly 1.1 Pg yr-1 loss by various disturbances, including selective logging. Selective logging, the harvest of merchantable species, is widespread in the Brazilian Amazon, with 2ha logged in 199-2002, equivalent to deforestation in the same period and emissions of 90g yr-1, increasing anthropogenic emissions by 25% over deforestation. In contrast, selectively logged forests remain forested and may recover stocks (West et al., 2014). Logged forests may accumulate large amounts of carbon (Pan et al.,201), but C uptake is difficult to estimate due to detecting logging from space (Frol et al.,2009) and quantifying recovery challenging (Asner et al.,200;H et al.,2012; et.,2015). Studies on field measurements (e.g. Sist Ferreira,200; et al.,200; et.,201; et.,201) and modeling (e.g Gour-Fury et al.,200; et al.,2007) or airborne detection (e Andersen et al.,201) assessed postlogging at particular sites. However, no spatial-explicit investigation of postlogging dynamics at the biome scale is available. Losses from selective are determined by harvest intensity and care, affecting collateral damage. Logged forests recover above carbon stocks via growth of survivors and recruits (Blanc et.,200). Recovery of pre-disturb in logged stands reportedly up to125 years, depending on intensity (Rutisha et.,201). The underlying processes, mortality and growth, vary with geographical patterns in forest and dynamics across Amazon and Guiana. Northeast-south gradients were reported for carbon (Mal et.,200), productivity (ag et.,200), density (Baker et.,200), and composition (tere et.,200). These gradients coincide with climate and edaphic conditions, from seasonal nutrient-limited in northeast to seasonally and nutrient-rich southwest (ues et.,201). Regional differences in biotic and abiotic constrain demographic processes shaping forest balances. This study partitioned contributions to post-dist carbon gain from growth and loss to detect drivers and patterns of recovery in forests disturbed by selective across Amazon. A long-term data from 8-30 experimental sites across Amazon and Guiana were used, meeting criteria: located in forests with annual precipitation above 100, total area above 1, at least one prelogging census, and at least two postlogging cens. Annual and season of precipitation, topil density, and climatic were extracted from globalasters. Diameter breast of trees >20 cm were measured and identified to lowest taxonomic level. Above biomass was estimated with allometric equations. Carbon was assumed 50% of biomass. ACS every tree was computed as a function of wood density, diameter, and climatic. Changes were available at Dry Digital Repository. After logging, ACS rapidly decreases until minimum, then reaches value a few years later, determining beginning of recovery. Focus on postlogging recovery, plots with minimum not reached within 4 years were excluded. For each census and time, 5 changes were defined: new recruits, growth
The study identifies two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural progenitor cells in the adult subventricular zone (SV) of the mouse brain: pre-GEOT cells and GEOT cells. Pre-GE cells are quiescent, resistant to temozolomide (TMZ), and contain stem cells that give rise to GEOT cells, which are mitotically active and highly enriched for neuro-initiating cells (NIC). Pre-GE cells lack the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture and are long-lived in the SV based on fate-mapping. GE cells are highly mitotically active, highly enriched for NIC, and short-lived in the SV based fate-mapping. The study uses flow cytometry to isolate preGEOT and GEOT cells from SV cells based on surface markers. PreGE cells are GlastEG−/lowlexBmid/CD−/O/PS−/−/Ter/−, while GE cells are GlastEGhighlexBhighCD−/−/O/PS−/−/Ter−. PreGE cells include type 1 cells, GE cells type C cells, and neuroblasts make up type SV cells. The study shows that preGE cells give rise to GE cells during SV regeneration after TMZ treatment. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 from fetal and adult SV using Nestin-C and Nestin-CERT demonstrates that preGE cells and GE cells require B-1 to be maintained in normal numbers in adult brain, but depletion occurs more gradually than expected. Even B-1 deletion in neural progenitor cells during development, normal numbers of preGE, GE, and SV neurobl are found in SV of 4-month-old mice. This suggests GE and NIC are less dependent on B-1 for maintenance than expected based on B- knockout mice.
Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel that senses forces in various cell types of tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed its bowl-shaped structure capable of inducing membrane curvature, suggesting Pie1 channels may influence each other's distribution and function. This study used cell-attached-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to examine Pie1 function at endogenous and overexpressed levels in NeuroA cells. Data with stochastic simulations showed Pie1 channels at physiologically relevant densities behave as independent mechanotrans, enabling cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the membrane. 

The study aimed to characterize Pie1 spatial distribution and functional interactions. Cell-attached-clamp electrophys has limitations, including spatial resolution limited by pipette size, were considered. Endogenous Pie1 density in NeuroA cells was 1.75 channels/mu2, with sources of error due to pipette size variability and inactivation. Overexpression of Pie1 in NeuroA-Pko cells had high variability due to expression levels and inactivation. The method had high throughput and precision, measuring density and function with accuracy over 2 orders of magnitude (1-100/mu2). Endogenous Pie in NeuroA and overexpressed Pie1 in NeuroA-Pko were not perfect models for investigating Pie function contacting each other. Experimental densities did not reach theoretical limit of tightly packed 2D lattice, but were sufficient for Pie membrane footprints to overlap. At densities 1-2/mu (Figures 1-2) and 10-100/m (Figures 4-5), Pie pressure and sensitivity were not modulated by numbers. Mechanistic explanation at low densities was provided by data and model, suggesting NeuroA Pie channels are randomly distributed or have low probability aggregating. This is consistent with Haswand and Macinn's prediction Pie structure favors to repel each other. At native levels, mild clustering predicted 20% of Pie channels within 50nm each, consistent with studies capturing neighboring Pie channels. In wild-type NeuroA, most Pie channels are far to 'feel each other, behaving functionally independent mechanotrans. This is ideal for cells to transduce forces homogene. High densities (up to 100/m2) showed no change in Pie sensitivity with numbers. Surprisingly, data suggest in nominal tension Pie open is slightly reduced with number, overall low (<1% at all densities probed. This is opposite to simulations Pie in proximity (1-3 dome distance). Reasons may be technical limitations modeling or experiments. Cooperativity may not arise membrane interactions, e.g., calcium permeating Pie influencing open nearby channels. Experiments cannot rule out this explanation. Conclusions may be applicable to cell types expressing Pie similar levels to NeuroA. However, specific types may concentrate channels locations dedicated detecting forces, e.g., neurons in nerve endings.
The study investigated the effect of volatility on decision-making in a random-dot motion task, where participants had to choose the direction of motion of dots in a circular aperture. The task was performed by three humans and one macaque monkey, with 663 and 14,137 trials, respectively. Volatility was manipulated by varying the probability of coherent motion within a trial, with low and high volatility trials interleaved. Reaction time (RT) and accuracy were measured, with feedback provided after each trial. In the post-decision wager (PD) task, the monkey chose between two directions after a delay, with a third target (sure) appearing on half of trials, offering a smaller certain reward. The monkey performed 65,751 trials, with 44,334 accompanied by neurophysiological recordings. The relationship between volatility and confidence was also studied in a task requiring explicit reports. After fixating a spot, two crescent targets appeared, with the left or right indicating the direction of motion. Participants selected the upper or lower target based on confidence. The same participants completed the RT task performed the confidence task. A head and recording chamber were implanted using aseptic procedures. Multi-unit (MU) and single-unit (SU) recordings were made with tungsten electrodes (1-2M, F) in areas MT (n=13 SU and 9 sites) and MST (n=13, 12) identified by structural scans and physiological criteria. The electrode advanced while viewing brief high-coherence random motion of directions fixating a target. When an area with spiking and directionality clear, a neuron was isolated, otherwise mapping receptive field, size, speed, and direction based multi-activity. Direction was strong (>2SD separating rates preferred vs. anti-preferred motion) proceeded with PD, tailing stimulus to neurons RF and aligning targets with motion axis. Solid in Figures 3-5 represent fits or predictions of bounded model. The model noisy evidence accumulated until integral of (decision variable DV) reaches bounds or stimulus terminated. Evidence comprised samples from Gaussian meanc and variancec, with mean coherencec and volatility. In applications, variance was assumed fixed and independent motion, but analyses motion and recordings motivated a more complex dependence. Variance was modeled as linear motion, with offset for high, maximal at c=0 diminishing higher coher. The Fok-Planck equation described probability density DV as function time. Confidence was probability correct given state and time, with sign of DV determining choice, except 0 coherence rewarded randomly. The model was fit to choice and RT, with parameters maximum likelihood. For PD, likelihood was sum of two terms, without and with parameters. Parameters were taken from RT. The bound was parameterized logistic time, symmetric around zero, with scale and location. In human task, bounds did not improve fits, implying stimulus used all information. In PD, stationary bound improved fits. Confidence was mapped to 0-1 scale, with 0 guessing and full certainty. The effect of volatility on confidence was evaluated for each subject, with linear model. The effective motion was computed energy in stimulus, with pairs spatiotemporal filters, selective directions. The filters were even and odd order Cauch functions, with constants adjusted speed coher dots. The pairs were convolved with 3-dimensional stimulus, squaring and adding subtracting responses. The motion was normalized by constant, equaling coherence. The energy profile was shown for an example. The mean and variance of motion were computed, ignoring rise and decay, from 50 after onset to 50 offset. Logistic regression determined if energy contained information volatility. The mean and dispersion were used with duration to classify volatility. The area under ROC was 0.895, indicating information present. The interaction was removed, area 0.85. The study investigated how volatility affected mean and variance response, counting spikes 100-200 from onset, avoiding offset artifacts. The were standardized and grouped to
The study investigates the regulation of the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) by the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, which is a homolog of the mammalian FOXO proteins. DAF-16 is regulated by the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, which includes the insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOX transcription factor D-16. Signals from D-2 are transmitted through AGE-1 and PDK-1 to AK-1, AK-2, and SG-1, which phosphorylate D-16 and prevent it from translocating to the nucleus to activate longevity genes. Reduction-of-function mutations in the IS pathway, from d-2 to akt-1, akt-2, and sg-1, extend lifespan in a d-16-dependent manner. Lifespan extension by IS is also observed in other species, including flies and mice, indicating the pathway is conserved. The study shows that the protein phosphatase PP-1, a 56 subunit of PP2, dephosphylates AK-1 at T350, thereby inactivating the kinase. D-18, the C. elegan PTEN, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase, has not been identified, nor the one that regulates D-16. Loss-of-function mutants of tax-6 and cn-1, which encode the catalytic and regulatory subunits of C. eleg calcine, respectively, were found to live longer than wild-type (WT) worms. Calcine, a Ca2/calmodulin ser/threonine phosphatase, has diverse functions in both cell activation and development. C. eleg, calcine regulates body, thermaxis, muscle contraction, and lifespan. The longevity of tax-6 mutants is partially dependent on d-16. Recent studies have shown that C. eleg calcine can regulate lifespan by suppressing autophagy and inactivating CRTC-1, a coactivator of CREB. The study shows that D-16 is a direct substrate of TAX-6CN-1, a calcine phosphatase, which dephosphylates D- at S286. The study also shows that UNC-43, a Ca2/calmodulin-dependent ser/threon kinase II (CAMKII), phosphorylates D- at S286 in vitro and in vivo. UNC-43 and TAX-6CN-1 have opposing effects on D- localization and lifespan. The study proposes a model where UNC-43 and TAX-6CN-1 regulate D- through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at S286, respectively. The study also shows that mammalian CAMII and calcine regulate FOXO at the same site, S298, which is conserved in C. eleg and mammals. The study suggests that sustained activation of FOXO resulting from inhibition of calcine may cause new-onset diabetes in transplant patients.
This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying the sequential behavior of grooming in fruit flies, specifically the process of cleaning their bodies after being coated with dust. The researchers used a combination of genetic and behavioral approaches to identify the neural circuits controlling this behavior. They found that the sequence of cleaning is determined by a hierarchical suppression of competing motor programs, where the most hierarchically superior module is executed first, and subsequent modules are suppressed. This is supported by experiments where flies were coated with dust and allowed to groom, and their movements were recorded and analyzed. The researchers identified 12 GAL4 lines that activated specific cleaning movements, but were not necessary for dust removal of their respective parts. They used these lines to test the hypothesis that suppression among modules governs selection, and found that suppression among modules is sufficient to explain the sequence. A computational model was developed to simulate hierarchical suppression among modules, using two architectures: sensory gain and unidirectional inhibition. The model was able to replicate the observed behavior, including cyclic transitions between cleaning and rubbing. The study suggests that the neural infrastructure for behavioral choice may have served as a framework for evolution of complex behaviors, such as typing. The findings provide a framework for future experiments to understand how neurons and circuits mediate serial behaviors, and a basis for extrapolation to organizational logic in network-driven sequences. The researchers used a collection of enhancer GAL lines to target subsets of neurons with activator U-dp1, and examined over 150 lines for increased grooming compared to wild type. They scored movements of 12 lines that were sufficient to activate cleaning, but not necessary for dust removal of respective parts. Inhibition and dust experiments using U-Shire1 or U-T showed that these lines were sufficient for cleaning but not necessary. GAL lines were stained and imaged, and neural architectures used to simulate suppression among modules: sensory gain and unid inhibition. Both networks were implemented in Matlab, based on three layers: sensory, hierarchical, and winner-take. Sensory and hierarchical for both, defined vector levels to represent modules. For unid, levels were initially set equal to amounts of dust, while for sensory were set to weights. Winnerake layer found module with highest level and subtracted dust from position vector. Constitutive activation implemented constant level of module, and leg assumed two pairs with activation proportional to dust. Iteration added small amount to pair assigned to clean part with maximal level. Rubbing initiated when level crossed threshold or above activation any part. Model output was position of module with maximum level at iteration, used to generate ethograms.
Shugosh-like protein 2 (Sg2) plays a crucial role in protecting centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division by recruiting protein phosphatase 2 (PPA) to the centromeres. Depletion of S2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during meiosis, including inefficient silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in kinetochore-microtub attachments. S2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a Mad interaction motif (MIM) common to Mad's partners C20 and Mad1. SAC silencing also depends on S2's ability to bind PP. S's M motif is close to its coiled domain, which binds PP, suggesting PP stabilizes the S2-Mad complex by keeping Mad in a dephosphorylated state. S2's regulation of bivalent stretching does not depend on PP binding but on phosphorylation at T and by Aurora/C kinases, facilitating microtub-kinase (MK) accumulation at kinetores. Artificial MK recruitment to kinores by fusion to CP substitutes S with regard bivalent. S has another function at kinores besides PP and MK, inhibiting Aurora/C kinases. S inhibits Aurora/C at kinores without affecting localization. S's ability to inhibit depends on prior phosphorylation by same kinases. Aurora/C creates its own inhibitor, generating a negative feedback loop. This feedback ensures Aurora/C will be active during biorientation, when attachments may be frequent, and less active later, when largely eliminated. S's role in meiosis is an early phase of high Aurora/C activity followed by a phase of lowered activity made possible by Aurora-S2 feedback. Lowered activity may increase MT-polymerizing activity of MK at kinores. S inhibits Aurora/C at kinores also unclear, whether alone or in conjunction with MK recruitment. S possesses multiple domains regulating different processes, including sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, spindle checkpoint, and Aurora/C kinases.
Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome. Previous studies have shown that mRNA localization in non-neuronal cells can regulate gene expression by targeting specific subcell compartments. In Aplyia sensory-motor (SN) cultures, a neuron can be manipulated to form synapses or undergo transcription and translation-dependent synaptic plasticity in a branch-specific manner. This study found that the local proteome is regulated at the level of translation rather than by stimulus-induced mRNA targeting from the nucleus. Transcripts, ribosomes, and translational machinery are delivered throughout the neuron, but translation is selectively activated in response to local stimuli such as synapse formation. Netrin-1, a retrograde signal, promotes translation in axonal growth and synaptogenesis, was found to be released from the post-synaptic neuron and bind to the pre-synaptic neuron in a calcium-dependent manner. Blocking netrin-1/DCC decreased sensorin immunoreactivity in SN paired MNs but not isolated SN, suggesting netrin-1 is released from MN and binds D on adjacent SN to promote translation at synapses. Net-1 binding to D may release translational machinery from cytoplasm domains or activate PI3K/MAPK pathways. Overexpression of Aprin in MN increased synaptic strength and sensorin immunoreactivity. Netrin/D signaling is one of multiple cues regulating translation in neurons, not digital on/off but graded. Sensorin mRNA does not need to be synaptic to be translated, but localize to site of netrin/D signaling. Sensor mRNA stabilizes at synapses over time. Local translation contributes to stimulus-induced changes in proteome. Netrin stimulates global translation non-syn sites detected by phosph-e4 immunocy. Every RNA delivered throughout ar, but translation localized at synapses/stimulated. Decentralizing control to subcell compartments enriches adaptability and plasticity, enabling each compartment to change prote in response to local cues.
Researchers used a CRISPR (CRISPR) system to manipulate the expression of genes ROCK1 and CD1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to study the effects on multicellular organization and patterning. They found that silencing of these genes resulted in distinct patterning events without loss of pluripotency. ROCK regulates actin-myosin contraction and expansion of PSCs, while CD1 is associated with pluripot and morphogenesis in various species. The study demonstrates the ability to direct emergence of heterotyp cell to multicellular organization in pluripotent cells and facilitates creation of robust models of morphogenesis for mechanistic study of human tissue patterning formation. The CRPR system was used to temporally perturb molecular regulators of physical properties, such as adhesion and tension, resulting in differing multicellular patterns. CRPR offers flexibility to target any gene of interest and timing of KD, allowing creation of dynamic patterns through genetic that can be used to pre-pattern P colonies in various multicellular geometries before differentiation. The ability to induce asymmetry can also be applied to co-different, where temporal of heterotyp interactions, such as presentation of ligand or receptor, can give rise to coordinated emergence of two or more cell under same conditions. Mosaic of KD can be used to examine how signals between cells, for example, interrogating networks created by mechanical adions or chemical gradients affect lineage decisions. The study identifies novel strategy to direct emergence of heterotyp cell to multicellular in pluripotent and facilitates creation of robust models morph necessary for mechanistic of human tissue patter and formation.
A resourceational theory of size effects in human working memory proposes that performance is traded off against the cost of spending neural resource on encoding. The theory is used to construct a resourceational model for local working memory tasks and found that size effects in the model are fully mediated by the probabilities of individual items, consistent with previous suggestions from empirical work. The model accounts for data from nine delayed-estimation experiments well, including effects of size and probability, and a nonotonicity between size and total resource invested. The theory implies that working memory limitations may be driven by a mechanism that minimizes cost, rather than a constraint on available resource. The model assumes expected cost decreases with amount invested resource, but precision in working memory is limited by sensory input quality, which is limited by noise and suboptimal processing. The theory also assumes no upper limit on total resource, but an upper limit can be incorporated by optimizing under constraint. The model assumes no lower on resource, but a lower can be incorporated by assuming probability is never zero. The theory applies to other local tasks, such as single-pro change detection and discrimination, and global tasks, such as whole change detection. The model assumes items are uniformly distributed and uncorrelated, but can be modified to account for correlated and nonuniform distributions. The model assumes variability in resource assignment, which can be reconciled with norm theory by postulating equal assignment is costly or unavoidable imperfections in inference. The theory makes predictions about effects of incentive manipulations on precision, such as feedback and reward, which can be implemented by multiplying cost with item-dependent factor. The model can be used to derive predictions for task variants, such as within-trial and between-trial experiments. The theory raises questions about neural mechanism implementing optimal policy, such as divisive normalization, and timescale of optimization. The model predicts nonot relation between population spiking and size, which can be tested by neuroimaging. The theory applies beyond working memory, such as attention, which may arise from need to balance performance against costs. The theory provides normative formal to test speculation and explain size effects in tasks. The theory raises question of why optimal trade between behavioral and cost changes with age, which can be tested by neuroim. The work is part of normative theories in psychology and neuroscience, reaching deeper understanding by analyzing system in context needs and constraints. The model differs from previous approaches, such as ideal-observer rules and resource-limited approximations, in timescale of optimization. The theory is related to neural coding properties, such as receptive fields, tuning, architecture, performance, and modularity, which are explained as outcomes of optimization under cost or constraint.
The study investigates the interaction between the plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans and its host Nicotiana bentiana, focusing on the role of autophagy in plant defense. Autophagy is a cellular process that sequesters unwanted components into autophagosomes for degradation or recycling. The study shows that P. infans secretes an effector protein, Pex54, which binds to the autagy protein AT8 and stimulates the formation of AT8-marked autag. Unlike other pathogens, P54 activates autagy to eliminate defense-related compounds and recycle cellular resources. The study also shows that P54 competes with the host receptor J2 for AT8 binding, depleting it from autagosomes and promoting susceptibility. J2 is a selective autagy receptor that induces aut removal of pathogenic molecules affecting host defenses. The study highlights the intricate endomembrane dynamics during plant-micro interactions and the need to consider path-directed modulation of autagy and subcell trafficking during infection. Other pathogens may secrete effectors with AT interacting motifs or target autagy differently, serving as tools to dissect defense-related autagy mechanisms.
Human cardiac fibroblasts (CF) adaptive responses to combined mechanical and oxygen changes were investigated in vitro using a multi-stimulus microdevice that applied cyclic strain and controlled oxygen. The study aimed to elucidate the effects of environmental stimuli on early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrot disease. Primary human CFs were subjected to six conditions: phyxia (5% O2), hypoxia (1% O), 2% strain, and 8 strain at 1 Hz. Immunofluorescence and protein analyses were performed after 12 and 24 hr, while supernatants were collected after 24 hr. Immunofluorescence was also performed on CF cultured at NX under 0 strain to investigate non-physiological environments. Results showed that mimicking combination of hypia and reduced contractility elicited inflammatory and fibrot remodeling of CF, while individual stimuli regulated proliferative and collagen responses. TGF-β, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression were significantly increased by hypia and 2 strain, while TN-α and IL-6 were not affected. αSMA expression was not induced by environmental stimuli, but TGF-β induced differentiation into myofiblasts. The study proposes a model recreating pathological environment for understanding CF responses during injury, replicating combination of oxygen and mechanical cues, and provides insights for future studies of myocardial remodeling and reparative strategies.
In Drosoph melanogaster, two isoforms of the DOM nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. The two isoforms differ in their C-termini, with DOM-A having a longer C-terminus with a SANT domain and polyglutamine region, while DOM-B has a shorter C-termin with no predictable structure. The two isoforms have distinct interactomes, with DOM-A associating with proteins homologous to subunits of the yeast Nu4 complex, a histone acetyltransferase, and DOM-B associating with subunits of the SW1 complex, a chromatin remodeler. DOM-A is involved in histone acetylation, specifically targeting lysine 12 of histone 4, while DOM is involved in chromatin remodeling, depositing HAZ, a variant of histone 2. The two isoforms have non-reduant functions, with DOM-A required for development and DOM for chromatin regulation. DOM-B is responsible for HAZ incorporation into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the SW1 complex, while DOM is not involved in HAZ incorporation under physiological conditions. The ATPase activity of DOM is not required for histone acetylation by DOM, suggesting a mechanism similar to the yeast Nu4 complex. The study highlights the diversity of chromatin regulation in D melanaster and the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional specificity.
The study investigates the role of β-catenin (Ctn1) in neuromuscular junction (NM) formation and presynaptic differentiation. Ctn1 is a component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, regulating transcription by associating with TCF/LEF transcription factors and adhesion-dependent signaling by binding to cadherins and α-caten. In muscle-specific ablation of C1 disrupts presaptic structure and function, with reduced vesicle density, active zones, and miniature endplate potentials (mPP). Overexpression of a C1 mutant lacking the transactivation domain (TAD) was unable to rescue presaptic deficits, indicating transcription regulation is critical for C1 control of presaptic differentiation. In contrast, cell-adhesion of C1 is dispensable. The study identifies Slit as a retrograde factor regulated by C1, a member of the Sl family of secreted glycoproteins that serve as repulsive cues for axons and regulators of axonal and dendritic branching. Sl2 is produced by muscle in a manner dependent on C1, and its immobilization on beads induces synaptophys clusters in spinal cord explants. Overexpression of Sl2 in muscle rescues presaptic deficits in C1 mutant mice, including innervation, vesicle density, and active, and mPP. The study suggests that Sl2 serves as a utilized by C1 to direct presaptic differentiation.
The article presents a study on the dynamics of cell-cell adhesion in epithelial clusters, focusing on the transmission of mechanical forces through cell-cell junctions. The authors developed a method to measure cell-cell forces with sub-cellular resolution, allowing for the first time, using a thin-plate model of the cluster and finite element method (FEM) to calculate internal stresses. The method was validated by comparing with force-balancing principle in tree-like clusters and loop configurations. The study found that cell-cell forces fluctuate temporally and spatially in response to variations in cell-matrix and cellular contractility, and are balanced by cell-cell forces. Cell-cell forces are transmitted short-ranged, typically on the length of one cell diameter, due to anchoring and scrambling by cell-matrix and actomy contract. Long-range transmission is possible by active regulation of force propagation. Cell-cell forces exhibit distinct patterns on soft and stiff substrates, with forces transmitted along periphery on stiff substrates and through center on soft substrates. The study also correlated cell-cell stresses with E-cadher-G intensity, showing a positive and significant correlation. The length of cadher-stress coupling was defined as the value where median correlation of randomized pairs falls below 50% of correct, indicating an upper bound for resolution sub-junction forces. Cross-correlation analysis of cell forces showed anti-correlation between cell-cell and cell-matrix forces, and decoupling of cell-cell forces when not transmitted. The study provides insights into cell mechanics and mechanotransduction, and a tool for future studies on biomechanics and mechanotrans.
The study investigated the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin, a protein associated with Huntington's disease, and the effect of polyglut expansion on its structure and function. Huntingtin is a large protein composed of 350 amino acids with a segment of polygl near its amino terminus, encoded by a polymorphic C trinucleotide repeat. The size of the repeat determines the age of diagnosis and progression of the disease. The study used biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and cross-link mass spectrometry, to analyze recombin human huntingtins with varying polyut tracts. The results showed that hunting is composed of five domains and adopts a spherical soloid structure with a cavity. The poly expansion increases the helical properties of hunting and affects intramolecular interactions among domains. The study provides a solution to the conundrum of how the amino-terminal polyut tract confers a property on hunting, causing disease. The findings suggest that hunting is a closed helical soloid with internal and external topologies that may mediate binding of proteins or nucleic acids, fitting a mechanical scaffold. The study provides insights for future higher-resolution studies to precisely delineate hunting structure and modulation by polyut tract.
Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in cells, and its degradation is regulated by a process called ferritinophagy. Ferritin is composed of 24 subunits of heavy (FTH) and light (FTL) chains, with varying ratios depending on the cell type. NCO4 is a receptor that targets ferritin to autophagosomes for degradation, and its levels are regulated by iron status. When iron is high, N4 is low, promoting ferritin accumulation, and when iron is low, N4 is high, promoting ferritin degradation. HER2 is a ubiquitin ligase that regulates N4 levels, and its interaction with N4 is iron-dependent. N4 is an iron-binding protein, and its ability to interact with HER2 is dependent on iron levels. In erythropoies, iron is required for heme synthesis, and ferritin stores iron before release via N4-mediated ferritinagy. In zebraf and K562 cells, most iron from transferrin is stored in ferritin before release via N4 ferritinagy. Transcript analysis shows N4 upregulation in orthoch erythroblast stage, associated with heme and hem synthesis. N4 recognizes F1, not FTL, suggesting a switch in ferritin composition from FTL to F1-1L at later stages. N4 levels are regulated transcriptionally, and its role in eryo may be limited to embryonic and stress erythropies.
The study investigated the hierarchical organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) and its role in goal-directed cognition. A 24 participants performed a 2x2x2 factorial design with factors of stimulus domain (verbal/spatial) and control (high/low) and temporal (high/low). The task involved determining whether a stimulus followed the previous stimulus in a sequence. Results showed a rostral-caud gradient of activation with caudal LP involved in current processing and rostral LP in future processing. Mid LP synthesized current and future information to organize behavior. Dynamic causal modeling revealed asymmetries in connectivity strongest in mid LP. Cognitive demands elicited top-down from rostral to mid LP and bottom-up from caud to LP. Top-down within LP was related to higher cognitive ability. More asymmetrical projections from mid to LP to LP were related to higher cognitive. The study suggests mid LP is a nexus for control. The LP was organized temporally with caud LP in current and rostral in future. The study used dynamic modeling to examine interactions among LP subregions as a function of demands. The model included F, M, I, cF, I, and S ROIs. Fixed connections were based on structural connectivity in LP. Modulations were explored by stimulus, control, and temporal. The best model was chosen through Bayesian selection. The model had an exceed probability of 0.72. Random inference was performed on the model. Parameters included strength of fixed, input, and modulations. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons. The dataset was split to examine robustness. The relationship between top-down, bottom, and higher cognitive was examined. Factors were created using PCA. The eigenvalue was computed across top-down, bottom, and cognitive. Signs were adjusted. The factors were intercorrelated. Hierarchical strength was contrasted effer with affer along rostral-caud. The approach was similar to a study in monkeys. The results remained if negative connections were set to 0. A quadratic was fit to participants' hierarchical metrics. The vertex of the function was the apex or trough. Inferences were on rostral and height. The height was correlated with higher cognitive.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of the homin-specific gene TBCD1 in the generation of basal progenitors and cortical folding in mice. They found that expression of T1D in ventricular progenitors via in utero electropation caused delamination of ventricular glial cells and increased proliferation of basal progenitors, leading to cortical folding. Downregulation of T1 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of basal progenitors. T1 was essential for generation of basal progenitors in developing human brain. Cortical folding was observed in mice electropated with T1 construct at embryonic day 13.5, with more pronounced at postnatal day 7. Cortical surface showed laminin signals at 48 hours post-electrop, excluding disruption of p basement membrane. T1-transgenic mice expressed T1 under control of nestin promoter, with three founder lines generated, line 10 used for analysis. Immunostaining showed T1 mainly in cytoplasm of Pax+ RG. T1 level increased from early to late embryonic stages. E14.5 mice showed protrusion of layer 2/3 towards p surface, folding of surface discernible at P.5 and adult. Immunostaining C1/C2, Neu/GF showed lamination in cortex, but T-trans showed gyrus folding. Staining panuronal, astrocyte GF showed folding surface in adult. No difference in born neurons or astrotes in P28. Cortical was mainly in motor, with mild in sensory. Cortical expansion was associated with emergence of cognitive skills in primates, but hypothesis based on comparative studies. Global regional changes gyrification index observed in subjects after training, correlated with performance. Decline in GI in mental disorders. Understanding contribution of expansion and folding to cognition challenging due to lack of models. Behavior analyses of T-trans mice provided link between expansion and cognition. Human-specific ARAPB promoted basal and cortical folding in electropated mouse. T1 appeared earlier than ARB, critical for expansion and folding. Multiple genes involved in expansion may contribute to folding in primates. Identification of hub genes may clarify role of T1 in cortical development. This study provides proof-of-concept for brain regulation by duplicated genes in homin evolution. Fetal brain samples collected within 3 hours of abortion, with consent and institutional guidelines.

The study investigates the role of ubiquitination in the regulation of the immune coactivator NPR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. NPR is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance, a form of immunity that provides broad-spectrum protection against pathogens. The study shows that ubiquination of NPR is a stepwise process involving the actions of E3 ligase C3 and E4 ligase U4. In resting cells, C3-mediated ubiquination of NPR prevents autoimmunity in the absence of pathogen threat. However, in the presence of salicylic acid (SA), C3 ubiquination induces NPR coactiv activity, while U4-mediated polyubiquination blocks activity and leads to proteas-mediated turnover. The study also identifies U6 and U7 as deubiquinating NPR, regulating its transcriptional activity and lifetime. U6 and U7 exhibit proteas inhibitory activity, prolonging promoter occupancy by NPR and preventing long ubiquitin chain formation. U6 deubitates NPR by removing ubiquitin en bloc, opposing U4-mediated chain extension. Other Ds may also play a role in SA-responsive expression, but their functions are unknown. The study provides insights into the complex ubiquitin-dependent timer controlling unstable coactivators in eukotes.
A study identified Pol IV and R2-dependent RNAs (P4 RNAs) in Arabidopsis thalian, which are precursors to 24 siRNAs. P RNs are 26-45 nt long, with a 5' monophosphate, and correspond to 24 siRNA loci in d2/4 mutants. D3 cleaves P RNs into 24 RNs in vitro. P RNs initiate with purine (A or G) at position 1, adjacent to T in DNA, and A or U at position 2, similar to 5 end 24 siRNAs. P RN with A tend to end with AC, while P with G tend with 3 U, matching 3 end 24 siRN. P with G often end with U, complementary strands have A at 5. D3 dicing from 5 A liberates top strand whose 3 end accounts for 3 consensus 24 si. Pol and R2 are required for P RN biogenesis, with R2 terminal transfer activity adding non-templ nucleotides to 3 ends. P RN begin with purine and end pyrimidine, characteristic of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. P generates short RN in vitro, size and 3 ends similar to P RN. RN biogenesis model initiated by Pol, with limited processivity accounting for short size P RN. P begin with A account si 5 end, while P with G account si 3 end, suggesting resulting duplex diced from opposite ends. Dicing from 5 adenos preference underlying alternative dicing P duplex from either end. P and R2 immunoprecipitated from transgenic lines expressing NRP2FLAG or N1FLAG, respectively. Pol and IV immunrecipitated from transgenic expressing NRP2FLAG or N1, respectively. R2 overexpressed in insect cells using BacDirect baculovirus expression system. R2 purified from High cells infected with recombinant virus and used in terminal transfer assays. R2 or R2ASM added to buffer with 32-CT, Mg, DTT, RNOUT, and RNA, and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Reactions terminated by ethylenediametraetic acid and clean-up performed using EdgeBio Perform columns. RNA precipitated and separated on denaturing 15 polyacrylam gel, transferred to Whatman 3 filter, and dried under vacuum. RNase assay conducted with R2 with RN ONE in reaction, incubated at 37°C for 30, terminated 0.2 SDS.
Researchers investigated the development of neural networks in the brain, specifically focusing on the transition from immature to mature patterns of activity during early postnatal development. They used high-resolution electrophysiology in mice and humans to examine the progression of large-scale and cellular activity across the first two postnatal weeks. The study revealed a discrete, evolutionarily conserved period of relative quiesence at the beginning of the second postnatal week, characterized by decreased neural activity and oscillations. This period was marked by a shift from local, loosely correlated, sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. The researchers found that neural spiking increased nonlinearly over development, with a nadir at the beginning of the second week, and population spiking at fine scales was transiently decreased and desynchronized at this time. Oscillations in the brain organize activity across spatial and temporal scales, and a key marker of this is cross-frequency coupling, which is important for regulating inputs and information flow. The study found that immature networks lacked capacity to couple frequency bands, but after the beginning of the second week, such capacity emerged, signaling a developmental shift in function. Oscillations facilitated neural spiking by biasing occurrence to phases of the waveform, and spindle oscillations recruited spiking above baseline rates variably across development, with lowest at the beginning of the second week.

In humans, the researchers analyzed continuous EEG data from 54 subjects, ranging from 36 to 69 post-estation, and found a similar transient quies period between 42 and 47 weeks, characterized by a lack of prominent frequency peaks and steeper decay in power with frequency. They detected spindle oscillations in all ages, consistent with delta in the youngest and sleepind in the older, and found spatial extent shifted from localized to broader around the inflection 42-47. Cross-frequency coupling with higher frequencies emerged after 47 postestation. The study suggests a conserved quies period in development, bridging a shift in functional networks.

The researchers propose that the quies period may be a stage indicating a shift in network mode from external-driven to internal, associated with planning and executive functions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the development of neural networks, particularly the transition from immature to mature patterns, and the role of quies in this process.
The article discusses the population structure of Plasium falciparum, a parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria in humans, and its implications for epidemiology and control. The parasite's population is composed of multiple strains, each with a set of var genes, and the diversity of genes in the host population originates from a predefined pool of variants. The total number of distinct reperto is G!/(G!), where G is the total number of variants and g is the number of genes. A model is developed to simulate the dynamics of the parasite population, considering transmission, mutation, and immigration. The model shows that coexisting parasites are structured into a few variants with largely discordant reperto, reducing diversity to orders of magnitude lower than potentially possible. The dominant reperto can exhibit partial overlap, increasing with transmission and influencing epidemiological patterns, particularly age-serology. The immune profile of each host structures the population into distinct patches or resources, causing immune selection to act on the parasite. Observations of individuals becoming susceptible to severe infection later in life may be due to short-lived immunity. The model suggests that reducing antigen overlap between strains will result in infection at older ages and gradual acquisition of protection, even without changes in var diversity. The model does not differentiate between infection and disease, so cannot address the impact on severity. Future work should extend the model to consider functional non-antigen differences between genes. The goal of malaria eradication is to reduce the reservoir of infection in humans to zero, and var typing is proposed to complement prevalence measures for surveillance. The model supports this proposal, showing nonlinear changes in dominant configurations with transmission. The results demonstrate no simple relationship between diversity and repertoire. The "strain" model suggests control strategies reducing transmission will not drastically reduce gene diversity due to non-overlapping reperto. This provides a plausible explanation for the difficulty in eliminating malaria. Surveillance might provide a molecular means evaluating control. The results have implications for similar pathogens with major antigens encoded by multig families, including bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens.
Deamidation of the glutamine residue Q100 in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC to glutamate (Q100) by the Shigella flexner effector OI inhibits the synthesis of K-linked polyubitin chains by the U13/TR6 complex, preventing the activation of the NF-κ pathway. Deidation does not alter the fold or enzymatic activity of U13. NMR and kinetic studies show that deid does not affect the active site of U13. Instead, it reduces the interaction between U13 and R domains, diminishing the catalytic effect of R. The interaction with TR6 is inhibited because E in UBC competes with an intermolecular R/E saltbridge at the U/TR6 interface to form an intram saltbridge, destabilizing the complex. The intram saltbridge also inhibits long-range interactions by R with TR6. Additionally, repulsive interactions between E and negatively charged TR6 destabilize transient complexes. Cumulatively, these mechanisms reduce the energy between U13 and TR6 by 1.69 kcal. The effect of deid is also observed in the U13/R38 complex, reducing the rate of Ub-discharge and Ub2 synthesis by folds. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of inactivation of the ubiquitin pathway by bacterial deid. The effector OI from Shigella flexner employs subtle mechanisms like salt-competition and modification of protein-protein association to inhibit polyubiquination and host response. This could be a mode of regulating cellular pathways by PTMs.
The study aimed to investigate the effects of optogenetic activation and inactivation of somatostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbumin-positive (Pb+) interneurons on auditory processing in the cortex. Optogenetic activation of S+ and P+ interneurons did not produce significant differences in gain, tuning, or information content of tone responses, whereas inactivation of S+ and P interne produced significant differences in all three domains. P+ cells appeared to increase transfer information through subtractive inhibition, while S+ cells provided divisive inhibition. Optogen activation and inactivation of interne did not produce symmetric results, contradicting the notion that optogen increasing and decreasing inter activity strengthens and weakens, respectively, the functions inter serve. The study suggests that precise optogen manipulations and brain states may govern conclusions about neural function. The findings provide context for future investigations of interne function, such as recent studies in visual cortex where inter were activated Ch2 produced diverse and opposing results regarding inter subtypes contributions to gain and tuning responses.
The study investigated the role of oscillatory activity in working memory (WM) using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate brain activity and behavior. Ten healthy participants performed two tasks: a choice-reaction task (CRT) and two versions of the N-back task (1-back and 2). The CRT is a 2-alternative choice paradigm for testing alertness and motor, while the N-back requires on-line monitoring and manipulation of remembered information. Participants were presented with a digit (0-9) sequentially, and detected repetition of the digit two trials before (2-back) or one trial (1-back). TACS was applied to the frontopetal network (F4 and P) with a return at T8, in two conditions: synchronous (0°) and desynchronous (180°). Participants performed one session each condition in a pseudo-randomized cross-design, with sessions at least one day apart. Stimulation was for the duration of tasks, starting at the beginning and finishing when task over, total duration 26.5 min. During sham, t was applied for 30 s at beginning each.

In Experiment 2, 24 participants performed CRT and 2 tasks in a block paradigm with periods (30) and fixation (20). TACS was applied in pseudoized for duration (30) or fixation (20), with a cross presented. Each participant performed one run each task and t condition, order counterbalanced. Stimulation in 20 min (11 36 per run). A subset were questioned after each block whether perceived t; the question appeared on screen for 4 with 'Yes' in right and 'No' left, requested to press corresponding.

The article discusses the role of the transcription factor Pitx in the regulation of embryonic axis formation and twinning in the chick embryo. Pitx is a transcription factor that is expressed in the posterior marginal zone (PM) of the embryo, where it regulates the expression of the Nodal/Activ-related TGF superfamily member cV1 (homologous to mammalian GDF1), which is essential for embryonic axis formation. The study used a combination of molecular and bioinformatic approaches to identify Pitx as a key regulator of cV1 expression and axis formation. Microarray analysis identified 122 genes co-expressed with c1 in the PM and c1-expressing edge of isolated halves, with Pit2 being the strongest candidate. Loss-of-function experiments showed Pit2 is required for c1 activation and axis formation in normal and embryonic regulation. Pit2 binds to enhancers E3 and E, which are sufficient to drive c1 expression in the PM and c-express edge of isolated halves. Mutations in Pit-binding sites in these enhancers abolished their activity. The study suggests Pitx is a direct regulator of c1 and essential for embryonic axis formation and twinning.

This study investigated the processing of olfactory information in the fruit fly Drosila's antennal lobe, focusing on how sensory neurons (OS) and projection neurons (PN) respond to dynamic odor concentrations. A novel odor delivery system was developed to precisely control and measure odor concentrations, allowing for a wide range of stimuli to be tested. OS and PN responses were recorded in separate assays with the same delivery system, and odor concentrations were matched between assays. OS and PN responses differed, with PN showing bigger spike rates and more phasic patterns than OS. A two-dimensional (2) linear-nonlinear (LN) model of OS-to-PN transformation was proposed, with OS spike and rate and rate of change as inputs, and PN rate as output. The model was tested with triangle, ramp, and parab odor stimuli, and predicted PN responses well, with root-mean error of 25 spike. The model overestimated PN rate before and after stimulus, likely due to nonlinearity's high slope at low amplitudes. OS and PN responses were advanced in time relative to stimulus, with PN peak around 200 ms after onset, regardless of odor dynamics. Acceleration in antennal lobe allows higher centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising stimuli. OS and PN responses were advanced in triangle and parab stimuli, with peak times 400-1000 ms and 200 ms, respectively. Acceleration in OS-PN and OS-P transformations led to rapid detection of stimulus onset. OS and PN responses were advanced in triangle and par stimuli, with times 400-1000 and 200 ms, respectively. Acceleration in antennal l allows higher centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly stimuli. OS and PN responses were advanced in triangle and par stimuli, with times 400-100 and 200 ms, respectively. Acceleration in OSN-P and OS-P led to rapid detection of stimulus. OS and PN were advanced in triangle and par, with times 400-100 and 200, respectively. Acceleration antennal allows higher to respond onsets slowly. OS and PN were in triangle and par, with 400-100 and 200, respectively.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of auxin in seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that auxin produced in the fertilized central cell is required for seed formation after fertilization and likely acts as a mobile signal linking fertilization with differentiation of surrounding sporophytic tissues. Auxin biosynthesis following fertilization of the central is dependent on paternally-expressed genes Y10 and TAR, raising the hypothesis that auxin is the trigger for seed initiation. Multiple lines of evidence support this hypothesis: aux rapidly accumulates in integuments after fertilization, impaired aux biosynthesis but not signaling in endperm causes seed defects, ovules producing aux ectically in central initiate coat without fertilization, and failure seed development in ag62 correlates with export. Impaired aux signaling in endperm did not seed formation, supporting that aux is exported integ, where initiates downstream events. ABC transporter P10 expressed fertilized cell and depends on MADS transcription A62, suggesting P10 regulates export endperm integ. Additional factors required for P10 function are lacking in ag62. Post-fertil aux production leads activation bios in ov, transported valves promote silique growth. Researchers propose dual role post-fertil aux, driving endperm and seed development. ag62 has defects both coat fertil ovules endperm seeds, suggesting A62 mediates both pathways. Ectopic aux in central sufficient initiate coat, but additional signals support expansion prevent degeneration ov. Mechanical from syncial endperm sustains seed growth. Mutants sporytic P2 develop coat, implying P2 block lifted fertil. Ectopic aux bypasses P2 block, activates signaling protoocyanin integ. Transport aux endperm removes P2 function integ, allowing coat activation signaling. Gene analysis showed sporytic2-coding downregulated fertil, likely aux signaling integ. Aux modulates transcription, but mechanism regulating P2 genes unknown. Researchers provide first evidence plant hormone regulating P2 activity, modulating transitions.
This study used the ORACLE (Optimized Recombination Accumulation and Library Engineering) technology to create a large, unbiased library of T7 bacteriophage variants to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of the tip domain of the fiber. The study identified hundreds of function-enhancing substitutions not previously characterized and mapped regions of function-enhancing substitutions to the crystal structure to rationalize sequence and structure activity and host range. The results showed that single amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enhance activity and range, with some conferring dramatic increases or specificity. The functional landscape on each host is unique, reflecting different molecular preferences of adsorption and fitness of wildtype T on hosts. Hydrophil substitutions were enriched on E. coli-10, while hydrophobic substitutions were on BW13. Notably, substitutions on E.10 mirrored those on BW13 mutants with truncated LPS, indicating convergence of selection. Function-enhancing were densely in exterior loops, indicating orientational preference receptor recognition. However, intolerant residues were in loops, suggesting alternative binding modes. The study found ideal targets for customizing range and activity in engineered phages and intolerant residues to avoid in engineering. The study used deep sequencing to detect low-abundance variants, excluding pseudo-counting 1, and used a read cutoff of 2. Of 166 variants, 3 fell below LOD before selection, excluded from analysis. Replicates correlated well (R≥0.98), indicating no PCR skew. Biological replicates were aggregated and correlated for reproducibility, excluding GQ (R=0.94, 0.95, 0.99). Positively charged, downward substitutions were enriched BW13rD, but correlation reduced due inconsistencies. Single-infection cycles were consistent, providing fewer cycles for competition. To score variants, a functional score (F) was used, averaging biological replicates, F=xVariantPostPassVariantPrePass. To compare performance across hosts, normalized score (FN) to wild, FN=xVariantPostPassVariantPass/WTPostPassWT. Variants depleted (FN<0.1) were intolerant, tolerated (0.1-2), and enriched (≥2). For BW13rD and rG, significantly enriched (FN≥10) were defined. Compared FN across E.10, BL, and BW13 to characterize variants and find functional. Substitutions depleted on all hosts were intolerant, tolerated (≥0.1), and functional. To characterize positions, counted substitutions at each category, colored (functional over 33%, intolerant over 50%, tolerant otherwise. Found cutoffs effectively grouped residues of interest. For host constriction, values >1 were reduced impact. Generated difference (FD) if FN<1, FD=FN, FN≥1 FD=FNmaxStr-1+1. FD ranged 0-2, scores above 1 normalized maximum host, between 1-2.

This study investigated the neural basis of perceptual weighting in individuals with congenital amus, a condition characterized by impaired pitch perception and memory. Participants with amus (n=15) and controls (n=15) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a task where they matched spoken sentences with visually presented sentences based on pitch, duration, or both acoustic dimensions. A data-driven approach identified four regions in left and right frontal cortex with decreased connectivity in amus group. The most significant results showed decreased connectivity between left frontal language regions (inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and right hemisphere regions involved in pitch processing (superior temporal gyrus, sulcus, Hesch's gyrus, and insula). The study suggests that decreased connectivity between right hemisphere and left frontal cortices may relate to unreliability of amics' perception and memory for pitch. This is similar to the weighted model of multisensory integration, where more or less reliable modality is given stronger or weaker weight. Congenital amus is often described as disorder related structural and functional within right hemisphere, particularly between inferior cortices and posterior cortex. Consistent with proposal, right frontal exhibited decreased connectivity in amia, and follow-up testing revealed right auditory areas involved. Also, left cortex showed decreases in amics, prominently with right auditory areas. Results are consistent with account right auditory areas not abnormally connected right frontal during tonal tasks but less integrated frontal hemisphere when speech and language. Null for differences in activation during speech are consistent with reports amics and controls do not differ pitch representations sensory regions. Brain encoding of pitch speech and musical stimuli unimpaired in amics. In oddball paradigms, amics show preattent mismatch responses small deviants but impaired attention P responses. These findings, along with amics nonol behavioral responses unconscious shifts when pitch-altered own voice, interpreted evidence amia disorder pitch awareness rather low-level processing. Differences in connectivity amics controls diverge from previous approaches, arguing down-weight of pitch during perceptual categorization both speech music adaptive, as amics learned pitch unreliable source evidence other dimensions.

Researchers have discovered a new contagious cancer, Devil Tum 2 (D2), in Tasmanian devils, a species that already harbors a contagious cancer, Devilum 1 (D1). Unlike D1, D2 expresses major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, indicating that loss of M is not necessary for emergence of contagious cancer. The most expressed MHC I alleles in D2 are non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in population sharing alleles. MHC I is emerging in vivo, D2 may mimic the trajectory of D1. Based on these results, contagious cancers may exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host, but loss of allogenic antigens facilitate transmission of D2.

The Tasman devil is the only mammalian species with two contagious cancers, D1 and D2. Both have similar morphology, causing tumours on face and oral cavity, but genetic analysis shows they emerged independently. D1 was first identified in 1996 in northeast Tasmania and has spread, causing 100% mortality and decline. D2 is a recent cancer, first characterised in 2014 and identified in 11 devils in southwest Tasmania. Immunohistochemical and drug analyses indicate D2 arose from similar to D1. Allograft D1 and D2 cells should be rejected by host through T cell recognition of non-MHC I encoded by M.

MHC I is a trimer that acts as ligand for TCR, composed of light chain and heavy chain. Classical M I are transplantation antigens, highly polymorphic, ubiquitously expressed, and peptide-antigen presentation. Non-classical M have little polymorphism, diverse functions, including regulation of immune, particularly inhibiting NK cell. Allograft can be rejected 7-14 days when host CD+ cells exposed non-M I and bound on donor cells. Vertebrates have M I genes, generally ortholog between species due rapid evolution. Five I genes identified in Tasman devil M, S-UA, UB, UC, UD, UK, and UM. S-UA, UB, UC are classical, moderate polymorphism ubiquitous, while UD, UK, UM are non-class, limited expression.

D1 downregulates M I and II, removing targets for T response. This is first indication D1 has immune mechanisms like single tumours. Loss M I due epigenetic downregulation and TAP, T2. M I can be restored D1 when treated IFγ. M I positive D1 used initiating response. Downregulation M observed in canine transmissible tum, CTV, M molecules downregulated during transmission, upregulated during tum specific response. In contrast, D2 expresses surface M I, indicating functional I present.

D2 expresses non-class M, S-UK, reducing immunogenic. S-UK expressed in D tum, S- heavy similar to classical I. Non-class can inhibitory ligands for receptors, some cancers downregulate I, overexpress non-class to avoid cytotoxic response. Function S- and S- not known, highly polymorphic, unlikely elicit allogenic response. Further investigation needed to determine function, classification Tasman M I classical or non-class.

D2 expresses classical I, S-UA, UB, UC, belonging to loci. S is most abundant, also found in devils, reducing immunogenic in these. Primers amplify known D1, D M alleles equal efficiency, S represents locus dominant. Found in dev, high in one population, expression may facilitate tolerance tum. Similarity M between D and dev reflects shared range, genotype founder. Frequency in population impact ability D spread.

Heterogenic M I in D tum, I not fixed, may lost. Some alleles between D and dev, tum have unique S74/88 differs S27 one amino not interact T, S90,35 share sites host I. Alleles lower
The granular retrosplen cortex (R) is a critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Optogenetic circuit mapping in mice reveals a dissociation in parallel circuits in R, with anterior thalam and dorsalic sources of spatial information strongly recruiting low-rhe (LR) pyramidal cells, while clastral and anterioring inputs preferentially target regular-spiking (RS) cells. Thalamocort (TC) inputs from the anterioralam, which contains the highest proportion of head cells in the brain, influence layer 5 pyram cells in R. However, the subtype-specific responses and functional impact on encoding direction in R have not been examined. The cortex, including R, also receives inputs from the densely connected clastrum, which innervates both excitatory and inhibitory neurons via laminar targeting and projects to many of the same regions as thalam. Claurocort (C) projections regulate complex functions, including coordination and amplification of signals across regions. Surprisingly, R is one of the few regions that does not return connections to clastr. Despite the unidirectional nature, no studies have investigated the functional or subtype-specific of Cla inputs to R neurons. Each region receives inputs from select cortical areas, R receives direct innervation from secondary cortex, contralateral R, and anterioring cortex (ACC). R and ACC, in particular, have been implicated in shared limbic and cognitive functions, including fear, but the cellular targets of ACC to R have not been identified Thalam, cla, and inputs converge in R, but do so via parallel or integrative control of target excitatory neurons. Within R, the superficial layers contain two subtypes of principal pyram neurons with distinct physiology, morphology, and capabilities: LR and RS. Using channelrhodin-assisted mapping (CR), we study the subtype circuits formed by anterioralam, cla, anterioring, and dorsal inputs to R. Our results reveal a dissociation in organization of affer axons and principal dendrites that supports parallel processing in superficial R. Specifically, we find that anterioralam and dorsal preferentially target LR, while clastr and ACC control RS. We show the dynamics ofalam allow the encoding of angular speed by LR cells, even though inputs only contain direction, not speed. Together, our results suggest LR are positioned to contribute to initial orientation in superficial R.
Traumatic brain injury (T) is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, and a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C). T can result from physical insults, acceleration, deceleration, or shock waves from blasts. The primary mechanisms of T and C share neuropathology, including hyperphosphorylated Tau, axonal degeneration, and neuronal loss. A gap exists in understanding how T is translated into progressive pathology, hindering therapeutic development. To address this, a novel method to induce T in zebraf larvae was developed, mimicking human T. The method involves loading larvae into a syringe with a closed stopper, applying a weight to produce pressure waves similar to human T. This method induces cell death, hemorrhage, abnormalities in blood flow, and postumatic seizures, similar to human T models.

A tauopathy is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), C, and other dementias. Tauopathies are characterized by prion-like spreading, templating misfolding and synaptically connected regions. Mechanisms of transcellular transfer include release via exosomes and uptake viaocytosis. However, these mechanisms were postulated in vitro, lacking appropriate models to visualize and manipulate pr-like spreading in vivo. Zebraf models allow longitudinal study of T-induced tauopathy, an advantage unmatched in T animal models. T is a gap in understanding how seeds are released and internalized adjacent or farung cells, the pr-like properties of species T had not assessed until recently. T patients with single or repetitive trauma exhibited Tau pathology similar to C, suggesting all T forms incorporate tauopathies.

A tau biosensor, human4-GFP, was engineered in vivo to detect increases and decreases in Tau abundance following insults, in a dose-dependent manner. The biosensor was deployed in zraf and able to detect Tau from various sources in vivo and vitro, similar to engineered vitro models. The biosensor was used to study T-induced tauopathy in zraf, revealing postumatic seizures as a drable mechanistic link between T and pr-like progression. Intriguingly, conclusions have potential for translation to T clinics where anti-uls are use prophyl for postumatic, further work to address if mitigate risk or severity of C or other tauies.

This study investigated the relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The researchers found that spatial variability in the topography of functional regions across individuals is strongly associated with behavior and lifestyle factors, and that network matrices estimated from group-level parcell approaches contain little unique trait information that is also captured by spatial variability. The study used data from 820 subjects with complete resting-state fMRI data, aged 28.8 ± 3.7 years, acquired across four runs using multiband-planar imaging. Data were preprocessed using a previously published pipeline, including tools from FSL, Freesur, H's Connect Work, and multimodal alignment. ICAIX-cleanup was performed to reduce noise, and only subjects with 480 resting time points were included. The study decomposed HCP data into probabilistic functional modes (PFMs) via PROFOM, a set of PFs describe each subject's data in terms of spatial maps, amplit, and timecourses, linked via an outer model. Signal-space parameters encode gray-wise means, variances, and sparsity of maps, while temporal parameters constrain subject network matrices. PROFOM was run on rfMRI from 820 subjects with dimension 50 PF, and signal-space can be reconstructed from PF via equation. ICA decompositions amplit were estimated as temporal standard deviation of times from dual analysis, and regular partial matrices were calculated. Tikhon regularisation was set to 0.01 for ICA25, 200, and 0.03 for Yeo, and 0.23 for HMP1.0. Spatial maps from dual analysis were used. The study performed Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to find linear combinations of behavioral and life measures maximally correlated with linear rf-derived measures. CCA found a combination of behavioral and life measures maximally correlated with linear rf-derived measures, and reported correlation between paired columns and associated p-values. The study also reported correlation between C weights and ICA partial matrices. Confidence intervals were obtained using surrogate data. The study created videos of spatial variability along axis of behavioral mode population covariation. Two rf paration methods, HMP1.0 and PF, aim to capture cross-subject variability in spatial location functional. Spatial estimated by both are associated with cross-sub variability, and weights of C results moderately correlated. The study investigated relationship between rf-based PF weights, modally-defined areal boundaries, and structural variation fractional area. Averaged C weights from two C results were correlated against fractional area and subject PF maps. The study created simulated datasets by taking outer product PF maps times. Maps were thresholded at 1 and binar, and results presented in file. The study compared cross-sub variability in range measures from original. Between-sub matrices were calculated from network, amplit, and spatial. Correlation were reshaped and partial calculated. The study performed ICA on group-aver task maps to avoid correspondence. Dual analysis was run against resting data to obtain times and maps. C was performed on resulting matrices and maps. Partial was to determine unique information in matrices and spatial. Variance by matrices was regressed out spatial and vice versa before running.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of TBP (TATA-binding protein) in skeletal muscle differentiation. They found that TBP, not TBP2, is essential for muscle gene expression in differentiated muscles. TBP is not expressed in myotubes from C2 myoblasts or primary mouse satellite cells. TBP-deficient mice showed intact regeneration, and satellite cells isolated from TBP-deficient mice differentiated into myot with same efficiency as wild-type cells. This supports that T2 does not replace T during muscle differentiation. TID subunits (TBP, TAF) are downregulated in myot compared to myoblast, consistent with previous reports. Mechanism of ubiquitination-mediated downregulation of T protein in myot was reported recently. TBP/TF is functional in progenitors and their progeny, consistent with earlier studies that T binds MyD in T-dependent manner. My efficiently stimulates TID basal transcription. Endogenous interaction between MyD and T in mylast and myot was demonstrated, and myot MyD components of PIC and TBP TIB recruited to alpha-sarclycan promoter. Relevance of T-mediated activation My target emphasized by polyglutamine repeats in T causing muscle degeneration, reducing expression due decreased association with My. This clarifies identity of proteins composing core basal machinery for gene in differentiating muscles, extending implications to pathogenesis of muscular disorders.
Targeted cortical reorganization using optogenetics in non-human primates modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity. While local effects of stimulation have been an area of investigation, effects on large networks remain largely unexplored. We studied stimulation-induced changes in dynamics in macaques. A large optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electroortic recording across primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex. We tracked two measures of network, network to stimulation and baseline between pairs of electrodes; these were correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S or M significantly strengthened gross connectivity between areas. At finer scale, stimulation led heterogeneous changes across network. These reflected correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent Hebbian plasticity models. This extends Hebb plasticity to large circuits, with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

Many neurological disorders arise from neural dynamics at network level, which stem from aberrant connectivity. The shows plasticity across learning and memory tasks and recovery brain injury or stroke. Proposed to take advantage this plastic to treat disorders. Implementing treatments requires understanding stimulation-induced plasticity changes network and dynamics. Hebb model plasticity and spike-t dependent versions explain activity plastic, including in vitro and vivo studies. Despite work Hebb plastic at cellular, unclear synaptic leads large functional reorganization. Recent studies large plastic following stimulation consistent Hebb mechanisms. Fetz and colleagues implemented activity-dependent protocol, introducing artificial connection between sites motor cortex. Continuous reinforcement led stable change stimulation-evoked movements, indicating induces large-scale plastic. Results reproduced in modeling network level. Similar results observed open-loop protocols induce plastic between cortical sites. Notably, papers reported off-target effects, interpreted global changes excitability or not explained.

We measured inter-area connectivity S and M using two measures, response to optogen stimulation and spontaneous activity. First, focused response to stimulation propagates network. Optogen in S and M evoked responses both areas, characterized amplit and delays. Delays bimodal with 3–6 ms separation early late responses. Classifying responses electrodes delay recovers spatial between areas, along central sulcus, shorter delays primary area stimulated, longer secondary. Short delay secondary suggests functional between areas. Quantified connectivity stimulus-evoked ratio (SERR). SERR defined peak-trough primary response normalized peak-trough secondary, both measured gamma 60–200 Hz signal. SERR measure connectivity site stimulation sites other area.

A study was conducted on a macaque monkey (S) with a congenital bilateral lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1) to investigate the neural basis of residual visual function. The monkey's behavior was unremarkable, but visual training was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine the integrity of structural and functional networks underlying residual function. The LG, pulvin, SC, and extrastate visual networks, including area V/MT, were analyzed. The LG was intact in size, and myelination was normal. The pular was also intact, and myel was normal. V/MT was intact, and myel was normal. Tracts between LG and V/MT and pular V/MT were weaker in monkey compared to controls. Functional MRI showed activation in the LG to a flickering checkerboard and pular to moving dots, but not in V/ to either stimulus. Probabil tractography showed tracts between LG and VMT and pular VMT in controls, but not in monkey. The study suggests that residual vision in monkey may be supported by a network of extrate visual areas, including V2, V3, and V4, and V/MT, which receive subcort input. The study provides insights into the neural basis of residual function in the absence of primary visual cortex.
The innate immune sensor IF16 recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus by scanning along the double-stranded (ds) DNA of pathogenic origin, which is essential for human defense against infection. However, the mechanisms distinguishing between foreign and host DNA inside the nucleus are not understood. Researchers combined biochemical and single-molecule techniques to show that IF16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed dsDNA to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms. Nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with one-dimensional movements. This scanning-assisted mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble oligomers efficiently on foreign DNA. The innate immune system detects infection by recognizing molecular signatures associated with pathogens, including DNA and RNA. However, DNA often evades cytoplasmic detection as genomes are not exposed until reaching the nucleus. To counter this, the host directly assembles supram signaling that triggers responses on invading DNA but not its own material. Key players target ds in the nucleus have been identified, but mechanisms remain unknown. IF16 is a key sensor that detects ds and uses as a scaffold to assemble signaling in both nucleus and cytoplasm. It plays a role in defense against several pathogens, including herpes virus-1. However, persistent IF16 is associated with autoimmunity, such as Sögren's syndrome. The mechanisms by which IF16 selectively targets ds remain unknown. To establish a signaling platform, IF16 must overcome two challenges: locating individual molecules on large pathogen genomes and inhibiting on host DNA. Researchers observed a unifying mechanism that IF16 resolves these issues in its foreign-dsensing pathways. IF16 assembles faster on longer dsDNA by one-dimensionally scanning to increase the probability of encountering other molecules. Single-molecule imaging tracked individual Cy-labeled IF molecules on stretched, double-attached λ-DNA, showing 1-diffusion along ds while bound for seconds. The diffusion coefficient increased with ionic strength, indicating no continuous interaction with the DNA backbone. A construct lacking the oligomer py domain showed similar diffusional properties, suggesting ds-binding domains responsible for 1-diffusion. At higher concentrations, immobile clusters formed along ds, with an increase in the number of molecules and decrease in diffusion. The lower limit of molecules in immobile clusters was equivalent to eight, corroborating optimal oligomers. The rate of addition to clusters was independent of cluster size, confirming absence of cooperativity. The 1-diff of IF16 on ds explains assembly increase with DNA length in bulk experiments. Longer DNA acts as an antenna, allowing binding more IF while 1-diff facilitates association. Saturation can be explained by dependence of diffusional time on length: at long DNA, dissociation of IF will be faster than scanning. Longer substrates work as traps, individual molecules farther apart and less likely to encounter. The results are consistent with ds-size binding in vitro and IF16 responses in vivo. The 1-diff mediated plays a key role in regulating IF16 immune responses. Chromatin has been speculated to allow IF to distinguish self from nonself in the nucleus. IF oligomerizes exposed foreign before heterochromization. Previous in vivo demonstrated transfected chromized DNA evades IF oligomer and responses. The mechanism by which IF could use chromatin to distinguish has yet to be identified. Researchers used competition assays to investigate IF interactions with diucleosomes varying spacer sizes. Diucle with spacers failed to compete against IF-bound 70p ds, while 70p competed similarly to 70p but weakly than 300p. FRET assays showed diucle spacers shorter than 70 failed to support oligomer. The 70 spacer supported olig but kinetics similar to 70p, not 300. Results show efficient IF16 formation requires 50-70 base exposed DNA. The size of linker between nucleosomes is about 20-30 in mammals, supporting chromatin as a deterrent
Spatially targeted microproomics (ST) is a novel proteomics technique for interrogating micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without genetic manipulation. Methanol-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROs, then soaked in a solution containing photo-tag 4-benzylbenz-G-His-His-His-His-His-CON2 (6BP) to saturate subcell compartments. Confocal imaging with two-photon excitation is used to covalently couple photo-tag proteins within RO to a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy and 1.48 µm axially. After solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated by nickel affinity chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. ST was tested on amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse and post-mortem AD case, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. The technique can be applied to various samples, including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo, biopsy, and post-mort tissue. Pathological protein deposits are hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease, with early methods including silver staining by Golgi (1873) and Virch's iodine-sulfic acid (Virch, 185) leading to coining amyloid (Vir, 185). Specialized stains emerged, such as Congo and thioflavin (S), have probed structure and composition of deposits. Detection and biochemical analysis have produced transformative results in neurode research, including discovery of prion protein and prion-only hypothesis, and amyloid peptide and amy cascade hypothesis. Recent studies have identified RNA-binding protein T-43 in ubiqu-positive inclusions in frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. STOMP combines two-ph microscopy with photochemical labeling and massrometry to resolve micron-scale features semi-automatically, providing clues to etiology of neurode disease and advancing cell biology research.
The study investigates the role of Frizz3 (F3) in the development of cranial and spinal motor neurons in mice. F3−/− embryos exhibit defects in the VIIth and XII cranial nerves, phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerves innervating the fore and hindlimbs. The phic nerve is thinned and fails to innervate the tongue at E13.5, while the dorsal nerves in the forelimb are moderately thinned, and those in the hindlim are severely thinned or absent. Motor neurons in the VIIth and XII cranial nuclei undergo precocious death at E11.5, before the normal wave of motor cell death at E13.5.5. F3−/− embryos also exhibit subtle defects in the migration of monoergic neurons and severe defects in the migration of VII cranial neurons. Non-migratory-derived clusters in the dorsal root ganglia (DR) show high apoptotic cells at E11.5, indicating rapid elimination of errors in the nervous system. Axonal stalling is observed in various systems, including chick hindlimb, C. elegans, and Drosophila, and spinal axons in zraf. The study suggests that F3 and Cels family members act together in the same pathway for axon growth guidance. F3 is enriched in intracellular vesicles, while Vangl is localized in growth cone membrane with highest in filopodia. The study generates a F3 conditional knockout (F3CK) allele by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The construct contains exon 3 with 3.4 kb 5' and 6.4 kb 3' flanking sequences, an HA epitope, and neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) marker. Colonies are screened by Southern hybridization and injected into C57/6 blastocysts to generate chimer founders. Germl transmission is confirmed by Southern hybrid and PCR. The neo is removed by crossing to germl Fl mice. The study uses F−−, B−, R26AP, H9EG, Ch-I-Cre, O2, W1re, and C1re mice. E18 embryos are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and decalcified in 50 EDTA. Heads are embedded in 3% low point agar and sectioned 200 on vibrat. AP histochemistry is performed as described. Sections are washed in PBS, heated in water, and equil in AP buffer. Histochemistry is carried out in AP buffer with NBT and BCIP. Sections are dehydrated and cleared in BB. Primary antibodies used are monoclonal-Neurofil, Is1, Is2, Br3, casp3, Fox1, GFP, Sox10, Is, Is, Is2, and Is/2. Secondary are Alexa Fluor, Alexa594, Alexa647. Immunostaining is performed on 1 embryos fixed in 4P at 1, washed, embedded in OCT, and sectioned 14 on cryostat or fixed in 4 at overnight, embedded in 3 low agar and sectioned 100 or 700 on vibr. Whole embryos and limbs are fixed in 4 at 2 and washed in PBS. Immunofluorescent signals are stable in BB and samples can be stored in methanol 4. Samples for AP are imaged Zeiss V with Axioc CCD and Openlab. Immunost are imaged Zeiss with Zen.
This study investigated the functional evaluation of transposable elements (TEs) as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells (ESCs and TSCs). TEs are repetitive DNA sequences that can contribute to gene regulation, but their roles are not well understood. The study focused on a set of TE families that were previously shown to be enriched for binding key transcription factors (TFs) in ESCs or TSC. Long terminal repeat (LTR) families RL9, RL13D, RL5, and RL13B entered the mouse lineage 12.5 million years ago, with copy numbers ranging from 35 (RL9A) to 2 (9E). Most are solo LTRs, but some are provirals, mainly associated with RL9 subfamilies. The study considered all LTRs, regardless of arrangement. Using aligned reads, selected TEs with enhancer hallmarks: open chromatin (ATACq data), binding at least one key TF (NANOG, OCT, or SO2 in ESC; ELF, EOM, or CDX in TSC), and H3K27ac. Excluding promoters, 634 TE+enhancers were identified in ESCs and 358 in TSC, 9.6% and 13% of all TE copies, respectively. RL13D/9 elements displayed enhancer profiles in ESCs, not TSC, while the reverse was true for RL13/5 elements. To confirm TE+enh display lineage asymmetry in vivo, ATq data from pre- and post-implant embryos showed 49% and 56 of TE+enh in TSC and ESC, respectively, active in early development. ESC and TSC TE+enh show asymmetry with chromatin in post-implation lineages. TE+enh are optimised for activity in early embryonic tissues, possibly through synergistic TF binding. A subset of TEs are important for gene regulation, but a minority of putative enhancers. The study used genetic and epigenetic tools to evaluate TE roles, revealing a set of T act neutrally with effects on gene expression, contrasting with earlier chromatin profiling. CRIS interference (CRi) of RL13 elements showed a small effect on gene expression, with only three genes significantly differentially expressed: Td12, S1, and Hook. Td12 expression depends on an intronic RL13 element, while S1 downregulation occurred independently of H3ac loss. The study highlights the need for functional evaluation of TEs on a case-by-case basis, as effects are variable between families and contexts.
The article presents a study on the evolution of C4 photosynthesis in plants, a complex trait that has evolved independently in at least 60 lineages of angiosperms. The researchers used a meta-analysis of 43 studies on 18 C, 18, and 37 C–4 species to define a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape of C photosynthesis. They developed a novel Bayesian approach to infer evolutionary trajectories from sparsely sampled, highly data and applied it to model the evolution of C photosynthesis. The approach is not dependent on phylogenetic inference and can be used for complex traits with limited data, such as those in the fossil record. The study suggests that alterations to anatomy and cell biology precede biochemical changes in C lineages, contradicting the hypothesis that declining CO concentration drove the evolution of alternative photosynthetic strategies. Instead, non-photosynthetic pressures may have driven early changes to enzymes such as PP and C decarboxylases. The study also finds that modifications to leaf development drove the evolution of C sub-types, with differences in timing of vascular and chloroplast division prior to appearance of alternative pathways. The researchers propose that early events determined downstream phenotypes of sub by line to independent pathways across space. The study suggests flexibility in evolutionary events facilitated convergence of complex trait, with four distinct trajectories and no inflexible linkage between traits. The approach was tested on artificial data and biological intermediates, with 50 occluded data, and accurately determined ordering events and assigned similar probabilities. The study compared pathways in monocots, eudicots, and N-M and-M sub-lineages, finding differences in timing of anatomical and cellular traits.
This study examined the bacterial protein SpoIVA, a cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to form static polymers. SpoIVA is ancestrally derived from an Era-like GTPase, a pan-bacterial ribosomal maturation protein belonging to the TRAC of-loop Gases. The study aimed to understand the selective pressure underlying the switch in nucleotide specificity of extant Spo and mechanistic governing its function by re-engineering its nucleotide pocket and examining altered function in vivo and vitro. The researchers restored the conserved NK motif on G loop and altered the sequence in G loop, resulting in a protein with enzymatic activity similar to ancestral Gase and hydrolyzing G with preference in vitro. The altered protein exploited energy hydroly of either ATP or G to drive conformation change required for polymerization, but only polymerized in presence of ATP, suggesting nucle base, not energy from hydrolysis, was required. This led to propose scarcity G during late sporulation drove evolution of Spo to preferentially utilize ATP. Amino acid starvation and onset stationary phase result in reduction G and GTP levels, coinciding with increase of nucle almones. Drop in G level also initiated spor in B. subis, possibly derepressing activity Cod transcription factor sensing G via ligand GAF domain. The study showed G and GDP continued 3.5-5 after initiation spor, when Spo is assembling spore, suggesting selective pressure drove switch nucle specificity Spo from G to ATP. Physiological intracellular ATP, not G, facilitated conformation changes Spo and SpoAGase. The extant can hydroze G, but residues no longer present, resulting GDP, precluding NDP multimer intermediate required polymer. This static protein, either nucle may be accommodated, but one promotes function, like adenyl kinase, where G binding arrests catalytically conformation but ATP permits structural changes. The study suggests Spo retained ancestral switch function TRAC Gases, nucle hydroly-dependent conformation change. Spo likely precursor was recruited for structural due capacity Gases form oligom assemblies proximity membranes, but became fixed in spor, substituted ATP for G due scarcity during late spor. Detailed analyses Spo will yield insights into residues evolved specificity binding and atomic mechanism multimer and polymerization.
The study investigated the long-term consequences of absence of leptin signaling in early life on energy homeostasis, neuroendocrine, and developmental processes. Mice lacking the leptin receptor (Lep) gene (LepNull) were bred with mice expressing Cre-ERT fusion under the ubiquitin promoter, allowing for conditional reactivation of Lepr at 4 or 10 weeks of age. The results showed that previously irreversible defects due to neonatal leptin deficiency, such as poor development of arcuate neural projections, were recovered by Lepr reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Lepr reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh expression and defects in reproductive and brain development. The findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. Leptin is a key signal conveying body reserves to the brain, and Lep-express neurons modulate food and energy according to stored energy balance. Mutations in Lep or Lepr impair the capacity of the hypothalamus to regulate homeostasis, leading to metabolic dysfunctions in humans and rodents, including obesity, hyperphagia, low expenditure, insulin resistance, and infertility. Lept also affects developmental processes, especially in the brain, with a postnatal lept surge associated with changes in fat or food. Lept signaling is required for formation of neural projections from the arcuate to post-syn targets, a process taking place in the first 2 weeks of life. Lept promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro and Lepob mice show disruption of projections. Exogenous lept rescues the development of projections Lepob only when provided in neonatal. The importance of lept signaling during development for long homeasis and other regulated by lept is not fully understood. To uncover the role of lept during development, the study restored Lep signaling at 4 or 10 weeks of age in LepNull mice. Results showed that defects considered irreversible due neonatal leptin, such as poor development of arc projections, were recovered by Lepr in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency early led to obesity via suppression of expenditure. Le re in adulthood also led to reduction in hypothamic Pom, Cart, and Prlh and defects in reproductive and brain. The findings that early in lept signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroocrine and developmental problems.
Arabidopsis heterotrimer G proteins play a crucial role in signal transduction in plants and animals. However, plants do not possess functional G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The G protein CT interacts with the kinase CL1 to control shoot meristem development, and GPA and AG/ have been shown to interact with B1 and CER1 in yeast-hybrid and BiFluorescence Complementation assays. This study shows that XL2 directly interacts with F2 and B1 to regulate F2-mediated immunity. The proteins coupled to the F2 receptor are subject to multiple regulations during F2 signaling. The interaction between XL2/3 and A1 leads to the formation of XL2-3-1-2-1 heteromers, which is dynamically regulated byg. Theg-induced dissociation of XL2 from A1 likely reflects the increase of G-bound of which dissociates from the dimer upon activation. The interactions of the proteins with F and B1 are also dynamically byg. The-induced dissociation of the proteins from B1 coincides withg-induced B1 phosphorylation, suggesting that-induced B1 phosphorylation triggers dissociation of the proteins. Decoupling of the proteins from maybe necessary for regulation of downstream effect. B1 is subject proteas-dependent degradation. Genetic analyses indicate XL2 A1 are required B1 in the pre-activation. Loss XL and A leads accelerated B degradation, and is blocked by addition of proteome inhibitors, indicating proteins attenuate proteome degradation of B. F2 is also subject proteas degradation, but accumulation not affected by mutation, indicating proteins do not generally regulate proteome protein degradation. Introduction of transgenic B1 restores g-triggered responses and disease in and mutants, demonstrating major function of proteins maintain competence of F2-B complex in preactivation. In addition to ligand dissociation XL from A, g induces phosphorylation XL in termin. Phosphorylation likely caused by B1 family kinases, two major phosphos induced by also phosphorylated in vitro. Nonosph XL mutants compromised g-induced production and disease, indicating phosphory plays positive role. Mutations did not affect XL-B interaction or stability, suggesting phosphorylated XL regulates other than B. XL constitutively interacts R, suggesting phosphorylated XL enhances production modulating R. R is subject multiple regulations including phosphorylation and calcium binding. Results show R additionally regulated phosphorylated XL, underlying mechanism unknown. Arabid heterimer proteins analogous animal counterpart, upon activation dissociate each activate downstream. Unlike animal heterimer proteins, Arab proteins regulate competence F-B complex prior activation.
Researchers investigated the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock at the single-cell level using a reporter for the core gene CIRIAN ASSOCIATED 1 (CA). They found that the clock is robust in individual cells, but desynchronised across the plant, with two waves of gene expression, one up and down the root. The waves, combined with variable periods at each position in the root, cause desynchron. Cell-to-cell coupling was observed, especially in the root tip. A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and period differences can generate the observed waves. The study reveals the structure and robustness of the plant clock, suggesting a decentralised coordination, unlike the centralised mammalian clock.

The Arabid circadian clock generates a 24-hour rhythm in key processes, including stomata opening, photosynthesis, and hypocotyl elongation. A hierarchical structure for the clock has been proposed, similar to mammalian, where the shoot apex drives rhythms in the root. However, there are tissue-dependent differences that must be explained. Experiments using lucifer reporter for activity have shown waves of gene in leaves and striped patterns in roots. The coordination of plant rhythms, how robust the clock is individual across the plant, is unclear. Integration from whole studies, a circuit of coupled loops has been proposed to generate the 24-hour rhythm. Simulations display oscillations, but experimental measurements under constant display damped rhythms. Damping is characterised by reduction of oscillations over time.

A study investigated the neural and behavioral markers of multi-talker speech intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing. The study included 27 participants who completed a battery of behavioral and physiological tests, including a comprehension task, FM detection, and interaural phase difference detection, and questionnaires. The comprehension task involved listening to a target speaker in the presence of two distractors and reporting the target sequence of four digits. FM detection was measured using a 2-interval 2-alternative forced choice task, and interaur phase difference was measured using a 2-int 2-altern forced task. EEG and pupillometry were also recorded during the comprehension task. The study found that 45% of participants with clinically normal audiograms reported some form of perceived hearing loss as their primary complaint. The combination of increased lifespan and use of inear devices will exacerbate the impact of hidden disorder, leaving millions struggling to follow conversations in noisy environments. Standard care includes pure tone, otoacoustic, middle reflex, and word recognition in silence, but new measures are needed for those struggling in noisy environments. The study presents a battery of behavioral and physiological tests accounting for nearly 80% of variability in multialker intelligibility without linguistic cues. Low EEG and pupillometry are low-cost and could be used in clinical settings to provide an objective measure for perceptual difficulties and hearing providers an objective for therapeutic or devices.

The study used a double-walled acoustically isolated chamber and audiometer to confirm audiograms <20 dB for frequencies up to 8 kHz. Participants then completed high frequency audiometry and comprehension with pupillometry. They were sent home with a tablet and headphones to complete supath testing and questionnaires over 8 days and returned for electrophys testing. Recordings were done in an electrically shielded sound chamber with 16-channel system and foil electrodes in ear canals and cup. Auditory brainstem responses were measured to 3 toneips at 105 SPL. FM was measured in response to sinusoidal stimuli with carrier 500 Hz, modulation 2 Hz, and depths 0, 2,5,8,10. FM amplitudes were calculated using heterne. Interal phase following responses were collected to 520 Hz carrier modulated 40.8 with phase shifts 0,22.5,45,90. Task changes in pupil were collected with head pupill system at 30 rate while completing comprehension. Pupil were preprocessed and smoothed. Single included 2 pre-trial period, presentation, wait, and response. Pupil were normalized and expressed as ratio of dynamic for each subject. Pairwise correlations were computed Pearson's r. Predictors were added to model from highest to lowest R, and adjusted R calculated.
This study presents a novel approach to non-invasively measure single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the mouse retina using a custom-built adaptive optics light ophthalmoscope (ALOLO). The ALO has three light sources: a 904 nm diode for wave sensing, 796 nm superluminescent diode for infrared imaging, and 488 nm diode for sodium fluorescein excitation. The system has a 1.2 µm lateral resolution and 16.1 µ axial resolution, enabling single-cell resolution of flowing cells in tight and sparsely packed microvess. 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied, including 18 primary vessels emerging from the optic, 15 vessels spanning 2-5 orders, and 90 capillaries with lumen <7 µ. Capill diameters ranged 3.2-6.5 µ, arterio and venu diameters 8.6-45.8 µ. Oblique scanning was used for arterio and venu, and orthogonal for capill. The 1D scan was placed oblique to the vessel to measure single velocity, with a 15 kHz rate and 0.03-127 mm/s bandwidth. The Radon transform was used to determine the slope of streaks in each ROI, with a SNR threshold of 2.5 to reject noise. The space-time image was divided into overlapping ROIs, each 9-15 µ in space and 1.6-9 ms in time, with measurements every 0.4-2.3 ms and 0.25-1.6 µ perpendicular to the lumen. Velocity was reported as a function of position along the lumen, with a spatial binning of 4 µ. Instantaneous profiles were phase-locked to the cardiac cycle, revealing dependence on phase. Models of blood flow were fit to the data, including symmetric and RBC and plasma profiles. Cell flux was measured in capill using split-detection, with a mean of 7.25 µ for R length. Lumen was measured using 796 backscatter and fluoresin contrast, with a mean of 2-5 µ strips along the vessel. Flow was calculated using Poiseille's equation, with a mean rate of 0.22-1.55 µL/min in arterio and 0.24-1.3 µ/min venu.
Spontaneous symbiotic reprogramming of plant roots by receptor-like kinases (RLs) is a crucial for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that discriminate between the two symbiotic developmental fates have been enigmatic. This study shows that ectopic expression of the receptor-like genes Nod Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK) initiates nodule organogenesis and nodulation gene expression in the absence of rhobia. Overexpression of N1, N5, or SYK resulted in spontaneous formation of nodules in hairy roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. The number of nodules formed was significantly higher in SYK-expressing roots compared to N1 or N5-express roots. The SYK construct also activated the symb-specific T reporter in the absence of M. lot or AM fungi, while N1 and N5 did not. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase in nodulation-related gene expression in SYK-express roots compared to N or N-express roots. Histochemical staining of the T reporter showed G activity in SYK-express roots, but not in N or N-express roots. Epistasis revealed that SYK initiates signalling upstream of common symbiosis genes involved in calcium-sp generation and interpretation, including CAST, POLL, NENA, NUP, and N133. SYK also associates with N1 and N in the absence of nod factor, suggesting a ternary complex formation. This complex may have dual functionality, activating CCa and triggering infection-related pathways. SYK undergoes cleavage, resulting in a truncated SYK-ML, which interacts with N5, preventing inappropriate signalling. SYK may have a dual role, promoting signalling and preventing signalling through SY-ML. Overexpression of SYK in Medicago truncula or Arabidopsis resulted in nodule formation, but poorly colonized by bacteria. The ancient programme for intracellular accommodation of AM has been co-opted for root nodule symbiosis, with SYK acting as a docking site for the evolved nodulation perception system. The decision between AM and root symbiosis pathways is made at the level of receptors, with SYK activating both pathways in the absence of stimulation. Negative mechanisms prevent activation of the inappropriate pathway upon contact with bacterial or fungal symbion. Candidates for regulators include interactors of kinase domains N, N, and SYK. SYK overexpression imposes a deregulated state on CCa, attainable through deletion of its domain.
DeepPose is a software toolkit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning. It addresses the limitations of current methods in speed and robustness by using an efficient multi-scale deep model, StackedNet, and a GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for keypoint locations with sub-pixel precision. This improves processing speed by 2x with no loss in accuracy compared to available methods. The toolkit is demonstrated with challenging animal estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals and variable lighting conditions. StackedNet outperforms the LE model and DeepCut in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving 2x faster speeds with 3 higher accuracy. The toolkit provides a simplified interface for using advanced tools to measure animal behavior and locomotion. Experiments were performed on the vinegar fly, locust, and zebra datasets, which are challenging for pose estimation due to multiple individuals and variable environments. The results show robustness to rotation, translation, scale, and noise, and augmentations were applied to data during training. Models were trained using mean squared loss with ADAM optimizer and batch size 16, with learning rate 1e-3. The learning rate was lowered by a factor of 5 when validation loss did not improve by 1e-3 for 10 epochs. Models were considered converged when validation stopped improving for 50 epochs. Validation error was calculated as Euclidean between predicted and ground-truth coordinates. Machine learning models are typically evaluated for generalization using a held test set, but due to small dataset size, a validation set was used. Inference was assessed on 100,000 images with batch 1 for real speeds and 100 for offline speeds. Hardware consisted of a Dell Tower workstation with 2 Intel E-3 CPUs, 64 RAM, Quadro and Titan GPUs. Inference was evaluated on consumer-grade computers with similar performance ±10. To rigorously assess differences, Euclidean error was parameterized by a Bayesian model with Gamma-distributed function, providing a statistically way to assess accuracy in central tendency and spread.
In this study, a small molecule, GB-N2, was used to identify glycolytic enzymes that regulate inflamome formation in macrophages. The results showed that disrupting glycol flux triggers inflame formation, casp-1 activation, and cytokine secretion in macrophages. The study also found that intracellular pathogen S. tyimium disrupts host glycol metabolism, leading to inflame formation and pyptosis. Restoring glycol or TCA metabolism with specific metabolites or glycol enzymes could be therapeutic for dampening inflammation. The study suggests glycol disruption is a mechanism for NLR3 activation in response to metabolic changes. The study used various methods, including NMR, ELISA, flow cytometry, and microscopy to analyze the effects of GB-N2 and S. tyim on macrophages. The results showed that GB-N disrupts glycol flux, leading to inflame and pyosis, and that S. tyim disrupts gly metabolism, leading to infl and pyosis. The study also found that restoring gly or TCA with metabolites or enzymes could be therapeutic. The study suggests gly disruption is a mechanism for NLR activation in response to metabolic changes. The study used various methods to analyze the effects of GB-N and S on macroph. The results showed GB disrupts gly flux, leading to infl and py, and S disrupts metabolism leading to and py. The study found restoring or TCA with metabolites or enzymes could be therapeutic. The suggests gly disruption is a mechanism for NLR in response to changes. The study used methods to analyze GB and S on macro. Results showed disrupt gly, leading to and py, and disrupt leading to py.
Researchers have identified a major DNA-binding domain of the PAL2 protein, which is crucial for its function in homologous-directed repair (HDR) in cells. PAL2 is a partner of the BRCA1 and BR2 proteins, which are tumor suppressors linked to various malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PAL2 coordinates BR1 and BR2 during HDR and interacts with several chromatin proteins. The PAL2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NDB) stimulates RAD51 recombinase activity and surprisingly possesses strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, NDB stimulates inverse strand exchange and can use RNA substrates. The data reveal a versatile interaction of PAL2 and a critical role of PAL2 binding for chromosome repair in breast cancer cells. PAL2 is a scaffold linking BR1 with BR2 during HDR and interacting with many chromatin proteins. However, a truncation with preserved BR1 and BR2 motifs but without the middle portion containing DB does not support BR2 and RAD recruitment to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Studies suggest an alternative BR1-independent PAL2 recruitment to DS through interaction with R168. A critical role of PAL2 binding was also suggested by studies of BR2, where'miniBR2' including DB with BRC repeats was 3-4 times less efficient than'midiBR' including PAL2 motif. Interaction PAL2 alleviates the requirement BR2 binding, including deletion of entire DB. Mutation of four DNA residues of PAL2 reduces RAD51 foci and HDR by 50% in presence of endogenous BR1 and BR2. Even 8 post-IR PAL2 cells complemented with PAL2-AAAA display defect in HR, suggesting failure to repair subset DS due to defective binding. PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for recruitment BR2 and RAD to DS sites and efficient repair in cells. PAL2 NDB stimulates RAD-mediated exchange in vitro. NDB encompasses RAD binding site, therefore, can recruit RAD to ssDNA initiate nucleation nucleoprotein. DNA-binding NDB plays a role in this process, as DNA mutant 146 retains interaction with RAD but unable to stimulate RAD binding to ss. Alternatively, PAL2 NDB can support DNA conformation for RAD binding to ssDNA/nucleation RAD filament, similarly to prokarytic Rec proteins. The unexpected is ability PAL to stimulate exchange between homolog ss and ds fragments without recombinase. This is protein-specific and not consequence of DNA melting and re-annealing separated in solution, as PAL2 NDB does not unwind helix and promotes annealing. PAL2-mediated exchange differs from RAD, does not require ATP binding hydrolysis and is less unidirectional.
Bacterial actin Mre (MB) forms antiparallel double filaments, unlike other actin-like proteins, which form parallel filaments. MB is essential for cell shape maintenance in E. coli, and its filament formation is necessary for cell elongation. MB interacts with the elongome, a complex orchestrating peptoglycan wall morphogenesis. The elongome consists of MB and its operon partners, RodA, P1, P2, Z, and MurF, MurG, and Mra. MB forms antipar protoaments in vitro and in vivo, as shown by cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures. The antipar arrangement ensures amphipic helices bind to the membrane and protoaments interact with elongome components. MB filaments are bidirectional, growing and disassembling from both ends, unlike other actin proteins, which grow and shrink from one end. MB filaments are stable, and nucleation requires inter-protoament contacts. In vitro, single protoaments can be formed by disrupting the interface. Antimicrobial agents A22 and MP destabilize MB filaments by dislocating dimer helices and weakening intertoament interface. MB filaments are unique among actin proteins, with antipar arrangement and bidirectional growth. The propeller required for filament response to nucleotide and hydrolysis is conserved, with domain closure and flattening of one side making interto interface. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural studies show conserved polymer cycle, with largest movement from monom to poly form. Active geometry favors hydrolysis, driven by catalytic glutamate positioning water line with gamma. Co-crystals of AMNP-bound MB with inhibitor confirm catalytic residue role. MB can polymerize with ATP or GTP, and active site accommodates adenine and ribose moieties. MB is essential for cell shape and elongation, and filaments are bidirectional, stable, and unique among actin proteins.
This study investigates the role of the APETAL1 gene in petal robustness in Arabidopsis thalian and Cardamine hirsuta. Arabidopsis thalian has a robust petal number of four, while Cardamine huta has variable petal number. The study shows that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator AP1 can account for the difference in petal robustness between species. The effect of AP1 is explained by epist interactions: A. thaliana AP masks the phenotypic expression of pet number QTL in C. huta, conferring robustness. C. huta AP fails to complement this function of A. thalian AP, conferring variable petal. Upstream regions of AP contribute to this divergence. Petal is a trait that distinguishes C. huta from A. thalian, varying within and between species. The study uses time-lapse confocal scanning and auxin activity sensors to track pet initiation in A. thalian and C. huta. A. th has aux activity maxima in 2-3 epider cells on the floral meristem prior to pet growth, while C. huta has aberrant or absent activity. The pt mutant in A. th mimics variable pet in C. huta and has similar aux activity. The study tests PTL function in A. th and C. h, finding no difference in pet number. The study uses homeotic ag to alter organ identity in C. huta, finding variable pet in second whor but not first whor. AP is ectopically expressed in third whor of ag mutants, associated with invariant pet. AP is a candidate for pet variation in C. huta, given ap mutants show pet loss. The study expresses A. th AP in C. huta, restoring four petals and reducing ectopic flowers. C. h AP does not complement A. th AP, indicating reduced function. Regulatory regions of AP differ between A. th and C. h, not coding. Expression of A. th AP is higher in whor two than C. h, extending further into whor. C. h AP is enriched in between sepals, away from pet whor. The study proposes AP divergence exposed cryptic variation in C. huta contributing to pet variation. The study maps QTL in C. huta, finding none at AP locus. The study introduces A. th AP into C. h, masking QTL effects, canalizing pet. The study suggests AP divergence perturbed equilibrium in C. h, conferring pet robust.
The study investigates the role of proinsulin misfolding in the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2) in pancreatic beta-cells. Proinsulin misolding is the inability to complete its internal disulfide bonds, resulting in a subpopulation of proins molecules with unpaired cystine residues. These improperly folded proins form aberrant disulf-linked complexes with other proins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to misfolded proins complexes. The study identifies proins disulf-linked complexes as an early biomarker of beta-cell secretory dysfunction associated with ER stress and insulin deficiency in T2 progression. Proins misolding is sensitive to changes in the ER environment, including excessive proins biosynthesis, altered chaper and oxidoreduct expression, and clearance of misfoldedins. The Cys B-Cys A disulf bond is critical for native proins disulf pairing, and availability of Cys B and C A recapitulates the ladder of improperly disulf-linked proins complexes. The study proposes a hypothesis that proins misolding fits into the paradigm of T2 progression in the Lepdb mouse model, where improperly proins is increased in the compensated stage, and insulin levels drop in the decompensating stage, correlating with beta-cell dedifferentiation and death. The study establishes the presence of a previously underrecited population of aberrant proins complexes in predi conditions and beta-cell failure.
This study investigated the role of the chromodomain (CD) of SUVH1, a histone methyltransferase, in the establishment and maintenance of peric heterochromatin. The authors found that SUV1-CD binds not only to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3me) but also to RNA and DNA, with a higher affinity for single-stranded RNA than double-stranded DNA. They demonstrated that these activities contribute to SUV1-mediated peric heterochatin assembly, including the accumulation of H3me and HP1. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that SUV1 interacts with major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of satellite transcripts using locked nucleic acid (NA) GapRs reduced SUV1 retention on peric heterochatin. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis revealed that SUV1 mutants with impaired in RNA or Hme binding were more dynamic on heterochatin than wild-type SUV1. The study suggests that SUV-CD's RNA activity is crucial for targeting SUV to Hme-free chromatin and establishing Hme marks, and that peric transcripts may modulate counteracting demethylase activity to regulate chrom dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of spatial attention in the entorinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in spatial navigation and memory, by recording neural activity from macaque monkeys performing a covert attention task. The task required the monkeys to attend to a moving dot on a screen and release a bar when it changed color while maintaining central fixation. The dot's trajectory was a Hamiltonian cycle, visiting all locations on a 23x23 grid, ensuring unbiased distribution. Recordings were from 141 neurons, with 20 (14%) classified as grid cells based on grid score and firing modulation indices. Grid cells had lower firing rates and higher grid scores than non-grid cells. Simulations with inhomogeneous Poisson process (IP) generated spike trains for grid, noisy, homogeneous, and place-like fields. The grid score, a measure of spatial structure in 2D autocorrelation, and field modulation index, a measure of spatial variation in firing rate, were used to classify cells. The likelihood ratio of a cell being a grid was computed by comparing simulated distributions of these measures. Recordings from the hippocampus, a region also involved in spatial memory, were used as a baseline, with a false discovery rate of 8.5%. The entorinal recordings had a lower false rate, indicating more grid cells than expected. Controls, such as bootstrapping and pooling, validated the results. Systematic biases in field size and position due to hemisphere or eccentricity processing were not found. The study suggests that entor cells can represent attention, not just location, and that spatial representations in the hippocampus may reflect attention, not just location.
Researchers developed a standardized behavioral task to study decision-making in mice, aiming to achieve reproducibility across laboratories. They trained 140 mice in seven laboratories in three countries using identical equipment and protocols. Mice learned the task in all laboratories and performed comparably, with similar psychophysical performance in a sensory task and similar strategies in the full task. Variations across sessions and mice were larger within laboratories than across. Success was not guaranteed, as neuroscience faces a reproducibility crisis, particularly in mouse behavior measurements. To solve this, they collected vast data, involved many teams, and standardized protocols upfront, incorporating open-science approaches. Collaborative meetings helped identify problems, provide feedback, and solutions. Standardization facilitated implementation and adoption by other laboratories. The task places substantial requirements while not too complex, engaging multiple processes from perception to prior combination. Reproducibility might be easier if requirements are substantial but not too complex. Variability in learning rates was not controlled, possibly due to expertise and familiarity with neuroscience and mouse, which may impede standardization. Automating training or individualized methods could reduce variability. The dataset will serve as a benchmark for better models of decision-making. A model based on stimuli, history, reward, and bias is a starting point. Data can investigate phenomena such as lapses, prior tracking, fluctuating states, and trial-by-trial learning. Methods and protocols provide a path to training and reproducing behavior, but may not optimal. The task is a candidate for studying brain mechanisms of decision. A reproducible task can establish neural basis of behavior. Different studies use the same task can compare findings. Examples include the tactile comparison and random visual tasks in primates. Without standardized tasks, laboratories record different neurons in different regions, likely different conclusions, not sharing data. The International Laboratory uses the task with neural recordings, combined into a large dataset. Laboratories adopt the task will rely on this dataset and compare results, knowing differences unlikely due to behavior.
Researchers developed a method for applying laser-capture microsection (LCM) to planarian tissue to define gene expression and cell types in the intestine. They used this method to identify genes involved in metabolism, nutrient transport, and immunity, and other roles in the intestine, demonstrating functional homology with digestive systems in other animals, including humans. By comparing LCM tissue to intestinal phagocytes isolated by sorting, they identified transcripts enriched in goblet and basal cells. They discovered unapprecited intestinal cell diversity, especially among goblet cells, residing in medial and lateral domains. Intestinal-enrich transcription factors gli-1 and RE2 play distinct roles in goblet differentiation and maintenance. Gli-1 regulates lateral goblet differentiation, while RE2 maintains goblet survival. Goblet depletion reduced planarians' willingness to feed and viability, with negligible effects on regeneration of other cell types or non-intestinal tissues. Characterization of the planarian transcriptome provides a framework for further studies on digestive cell types, mechanisms, and regeneration.

The researchers used LCM to dissect intestinal, medial, lateral, and non-intestinal regions from 8-10 sections per slide within 45-50 minutes. RNA was extracted from captured tissue, pooled, and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq. Reads were trimmed, mapped to the ddmed6 transcriptome, and analyzed using edgeR. They identified 184 intestine-enrich transcripts, 122 medially enriched, and 623 laterally. Duges japonica transcripts upregulated in response to L pneumophila or aureus were queried against dd6 transcripts, and 783 hits remained, 99 intestine-enrich.

Images were collected on Zeiss, Olympus, and processed ImageJ. Animals were separated, imaged, and analyzed GraphPad.
This study investigates the sensory coding mechanisms of weakly electric fish, specifically the mormyrids, and their ability to detect and respond to electric signals in their environment. The researchers found that mormrids have two types of sensory receptors: spiking and oscillatory receptors. Spiking receptors are sensitive to the waveform of the electric signal, while oscillatory receptors are sensitive to the interpulse intervals (IPI) between signals. The study shows that oscillatory receptors are more sensitive to submillisecond PIs, which are too short for spiking receptors to encode, and are produced by groups of fish, not individuals. Behavioral experiments demonstrate that species with oscillatory receptors respond strongly to submill PIs, while species with spiking receptors do not. The study suggests that oscillatory receptors are an adaptation for detecting signals from groups of conspecifics.

The researchers used extracellular recordings from single receptors to study their responses to stimuli and found that oscillatory receptors respond with phase resets, leading to transient synchrony among receptors. The study also found that oscillatory receptors are matched filters for I patterns, not waveforms, and are tuned to lower frequencies than peak frequencies of conspecific EODs. Spiking receptors, on the other hand, are matched for waveforms and tuned to frequencies near peak of conspecific EODs. The study suggests that spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals, while oscillatory are for signals from groups.

The study also found that oscillatory receptors have intrinsic oscillations, which contribute to their sensitivity to submill PIs. The researchers propose a mechanism for central processing oscillatory inputs, where excitation and inhibition from receptive fields establish single-ne selectivity for pulse durations and I. The study also found that oscillatory receptors have a smaller exterolateral nucleus, not subdivided into anterior and posterior regions, and produce high-frequency oscillations. The study suggests that central processing oscillatory inputs could distinguish self-generated from external stimuli while maximizing sensitivity to external.

Behavioral experiments show that species with oscillatory receptors respond to I stimuli differently than species with spiking receptors. The study found that species with oscillatory have stronger responses to sub PIs, while species spiking have stronger responses to intermediate PIs. The study suggests that oscillatory are adaptation for detecting signals from groups of conspecific. The study also found that oscillatory have intrinsic oscillations, which contribute to their sensitivity to sub P. The researchers propose a mechanism for central processing oscillatory, where excitation and inhibition from receptive fields establish single selectivity for pulse and I.
The study presents a 3.5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryEM) structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1, a member of the Podoviridae family, which infects and kills Bordet species that cause whooping cough in humans and other mammals. BPP-1 has a T=7 icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 670 Å. The cryoEM structure shows that the capsid protein (CP) has an HK-like fold, but the shell has an additional component, a major capsid protein (MCP) that decorates the shell. B-1 is an attractive phage system due to its unique diversity-generating retroelement (DGR), which introduces diversity into protein-coding DNA sequences to accelerate adaptive traits. The atomic structure of B-1 will enhance bioengineering efforts and reveal non-coval molecular interactions of caps formation and evolutionary relationships between B- MCP and CP proteins in other viruses. The study identifies the genes encoding MCP and CP by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, and constructs in-frame deletions of bb16 and bb17 genes show that both are essential for phage production. The atomic models of MCP and CP are built from cryEM density and refined with Phenix, with R-factors of 0.26/0.27 at 3.5 resolution. The topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted compared to the known Johnson fold, which has been observed in Siphiridae and Myiridae families. B- is the first virus to contain both jelly and HK-like folds, suggesting it is a hybrid of the two lineages. The study provides a map for harnessing the unique properties of B- for phage engineering.
This study used high-resolution sequencing to quantify the contribution of beneficial and deleterious mutations in shaping the evolutionary paths of Dengue virus (DENV) populations responding to cell-specific selective pressures. The analysis showed that DENV populations acquire host-specific structures defined by genotype-fitness landscapes, which shift the population sequence and result in a concurrent increase in phenotypic fitness, as assessed by morphology and titers. The study found that simple models of mean fitness derived from allele measurements can predict phenotyp adaptation, suggesting that the phenotype and evolutionary dynamics of a virus can be described by fitness of all alleles in the population. The study also found that viral populations carry a large burden of detrimental mutations that imposes a significant cost on the population that persists across passage, highlighting the importance of negative selection in shaping viral diversity. The ability to map constraint across the genome highlights vulnerabilities that could be harn to develop antiv drugs and vaccines refractory to emergence and escape. The study identified clusters of adaptive mutations in regions of the DENV suggest elements targeted by selection in each host, and examined structural properties of these to understand biophysical that influence DENV adaptation. The DENV poly consists of soluble and transmembrane domains, with transmem domains depleted of beneficial and enriched lethal mutations, while nonmem regions showed differences between structured and intrically disordered (ID) regions. Beneficial were enriched in ID, but not structured, while lethal were in ordered, highlighting evolutionary constraints by maintaining stability. The study linked structural and fitness measured mirrors conservation and variation across natural isolates D and Zika virus, indicating relationships adaptability, flexibility, and phenotyp redundancy uncovered in a model of D adaptation to human and mosquito cells suggest principles of flavivirus broadly.
High-throughput single-particle tracking reveals membrane nanodomains that dictate KRas12 diffusion and trafficking. Membrane nanodomains have been implicated in Ras signaling, but their organization and interactions with Ras remain unclear. Using single-particle tracking photoactivated microscopy (s-PAL) and trajectory analysis, the authors show that KRas12 diffusion on the membrane is best described by a three-state model: fast, immobile, and intermediate. They map the locations where KRas12 exhibits specific states, revealing nanodomains corresponding to intermediate and immobile states. KRas12 almost always transitions between fast and imm states through intermediate. KRas membrane is in a non-equilibrium steady state, with KR12 constitutively removed through immobile and replenished fast, potentially coupled to endocyt and recycling. Partition of KR12 into states is invariant over a range of expression levels, demonstrating homeostasis. The authors propose a model for membrane and trafficking, where KRas experiences three environments: regular membrane, transition zone, and immobilization site. The transition and immobil sites have lifetimes, freely diffusing KR12 enters transition, slows, returns to fast, or becomes trapped. Entrapment fraction leaves plasma to cycle KR12 trafficking. The model refines existing KR12 diffusion models, introducing intermediate and nanomain role. The three-state model captures KR12 membrane dynamics, with intermediate and imm states associated with distinct nanodomains. Measured nanodomain sizes are 70 and 200 nm, consistent with previous beliefs. The model could be an over-simplification, with endytic and non-endytic mechanisms contributing immobil. The nested nanomain configuration is plausible, with structures trapping KR12 in regions enriched proteins or lipids. KR12 travels through intermediate to access immobil, explaining state pathway. Phosphatidser importance in KR clustering and activation supports this scenario. KR12 needs to be removed imm and replenished, potentially through endyt and recycling. Partition KR is invariant over range levels, coinciding previous observations. Mechanistic understanding is important for Ras functions, multimers implicated in signaling. Experimental and computational work is ongoing.
This study investigates the mechanism of bone morphogen protein (BMP) gradient formation in the zebraf embryo during dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning. The authors use a combination of quantitative analysis and computational modeling to identify a source-sink mechanism, where BMP diffuses dorsally to bind to Chordin, a BMP antagonist, forming a sink that drives the gradient. This mechanism is distinct from the previously proposed counter-gradient model, where Chordin diffuses ventrally to bind BMP. The study shows that the sourceink mechanism is more robust to changes in biophysical parameters and is supported by measured BMP diffusivity of 4.4±0.4 μm/s. The authors also demonstrate that the shape of the BMP expression domain contributes to gradient formation, even if it does not entirely account for it. The study uses whole-mount in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunostaining to measure BMP expression and Pmad levels in zraf embryos. The results show a significant difference between wild-type and chordin mutant embryos, with a larger difference than embryo-to-embryo variability. The study uses a mathematical model to simulate the system, solving partial differential equations for BMP, Ch, Ngin, and BMP-Ch complexes. The model is solved for the developmental window from 3.5 to 5.7 h, and measurements are calculated at 5.7 h. Each parameter is selected from a uniform distribution in log space, covering four orders of magnitude within physiological range. The study classifies simulations as transcription, sourceink, counter, or shuttling based on residuals between model and data. The study also uses fluorescence recovery photoble (FR) to measure diffusivity of B2-Venus protein. The results show recovery at the periphery of the bleached region, with an effective diffusivity of 4.4±0.4 μm/s. The study concludes that the sourceink mechanism is the most likely mechanism of BMP gradient formation in zraf DV patter.
Lysosomal MF1 (MF1) is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters, which mediate secondary or passive transport processes across cellular membranes. MF1 is poorly characterized, but has been identified as a direct target of the transcription factor EB (TF)-mediated gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and gene expression. Overexpression of epitope-tagged MF1 in HeLa cells showed localization with lysosomal markers, confirming its lysosomal localization. MF1 contains 12 transmembrane domains and is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues, with a dileucine-based sorting motif in its cytos N-terminus required for transport to lysosomes. MF1 knockout (KO) mice develop severe liver disease with extravasation of erythrocytes, sinus damage of liver endothelial cells, and fibrosis. Proteomics of isolated lysosomes from MF1KO mice revealed GL as an essential protein for MF1. GL is highly glycosylated and a lysosomal protein of unknown function. Deficiency of MF1 leads to drastically reduced GL and vice versa. MF1 and GL physically interact and GL-deficient mice mimic MF1 KO phenotype. MF1 shows homology to proteobacterial intragos amino acid (P) transporters, but no difference in serum amino acids was detectable in MFKO mice. Direct uptake of radioactively labeled amino acids in HEK cells overexpressing MF1LLAA was undetectable. MF1 is not a transporter for tested amino acids under conditions. Proteomics of lysosomes from wild and MF1KO mice showed slight differences, with MF1 strikingly decreased and GL prominently reduced in all replicates. GL is a glycosyl type transmembrane protein previously shown to be a lysosomal component. MF1 and GL interact physically and depend on each other for stability. MF1 stability against lysosomal proteolysis depends on GL. MF1 levels in MFKO are reduced, and stability of GL also depends on non-gcosylated MF1, a counterintuitive finding implicating glyylation and protein interaction maintain stable complex. MF and GL are essential for lysosomal homeasis, particularly in liver and liver endothelial cells.
High-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of the human kines motor domain K349 in two chemical states, no-nucle and AD•AlFx, were obtained at 5.6 Å resolution, providing insight into the mechanism of kines's microtub-attached cycle. The noucle state reveals a clam-like closure of the nucleotide cleft by rotation of the N-terminal domain, accompanied by docking of the linker, while the AD• state shows an open nucle cleft due to steric clash between N255 and tubulin. The switch loop remains closed in both states, interacting with the switch helix and tubulin. N255 acts as a 'chpin' linking switch closure to tubulin. The N255K mutation uncouples nucleotide and microtub binding, reducing microtule-stim AD release by 1000-fold. A gating between heads of dimer kines is achieved by the neck linker, favoring docking in the trailing head and opening in the leading. The mechanism is similar to myos, with a lever movement coupled to beta sheet relaxation. The kines and myos are ancestrally related and share nucle-sensing motifs. The kines-microtub complex was simulated using MDFF with a cryoEM potential, resulting in a 1.8 Å RMSD from the 4NA structure. The model was selected at 1.2 ns, avoiding overfitting. The noucle state was simulated similarly, with a 1.4 ns transition and 1.5 RMSD from the starting. The model was selected at 1.4 ns, showing excellent agreement with the map. A follow-up simulations maintained the switch network in both states.
Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and metabolism, and quality control (QC) mechanisms must dispose of damaged proteins that compromise function. In mammalian cells, this is accomplished at the macro level through mitophagy. Here, a ubiquitin-proteome (UPS)-mediated pathway for the degradation of individual yeast mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins is defined using two model substrates, sam-2Hs and sen-1Hs. These substrates contain mutations that render them unstable at non-permissive temperatures, mimicking damaged, misfolded proteins. The MAD pathway requires both cytosolic and mitochondrial machinery, utilizing factors not previously linked to mitochondria or implicated in MOM degradation. It is distinct from other QC pathways, with points of intersection, and requires 26 proteasome activity. The C48-N4-U1 AAA-ATase complex represents a point of convergence with ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways. M1 is dispensable for degradation of mitochondrial substrates, which remain at mitochondria and are degraded independently of ER E2 or E3. The determinants, spatial, restrictions, and coactors underlie ubiquination and degradation at mitochond versus M1-dependent re-targeting will be elucidated. The C48-N4-U1 complex plays a role in both pathways, utilizing substrate coactors V1 and Do1. V1 is recruited to mitochondria from cytos in response to translational or oxidative stress, while Do1 is implicated in native MOM turnover. Only Do1 has an effect on mitochondrial degradation. U2, an ER transmembrane protein, has a broad role in MAD and homeostasis in addition to ERAD, with a discrete, functional, mitochondrial pool. U2 interacts with F1 at mitochondria and is required for its degradation, raising the possibility of a broad role in MAD and homeasis. No involvement of R5 or SCdm ubiquitinases, implicated in native MOM and integrity, is found. San and U1, broad QC E3s for misfold cyolic and nuclear proteins, are required for mitochondrial substrates. Recent studies suggest degradation of cyolic San and U1 substrates requires prior import. Sam-2s and sen-1s, however, remain when degradation is blocked, and factors in import are dispensable. U1 contributes to ERAD, but MAD is distinct. Recognition of QC substrates as improperly folded requires chaper. The SSA H70 family is involved in ts protein degradation, commonality with cyolic QC and ER pathways. The family is required for co-transational or import of some proteins, positioning to recognize misfold and target to UPS. F1 degradation does not require H70, extending a distinction between misfold substrates and regulated ubiquination. Inner and IMS proteins have been identified proteas substrates, overlaps and diverges from QC defined.
In this study, transgenic mice expressing a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ER) were used to visualize ER activity in epidermal cells at single-cell resolution. Long-term imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ER activity, where ER activation originates from a few cells and propagates radially to a radius of about 50 μm over 30 minutes until disappearance. This phenomenon was named Spatial Propagation of Radial ER Activity (SP) and its mechanism and role in cell cycle progression were investigated. Single-cell analysis of SP and inhibitor treatment revealed similarities and differences between patterns of ER activation in vitro and in vivo, sharing common dependence on epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFs) and production of cognate ligands, but differing in efficiency and amplitude of ER activation propagation. SPs were induced by double TPA treatment, suggesting alterations in SP could be involved in tumorigenesis. Dependency on EGFs and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) suggests common mechanism between SP and ER activation in tissue cells. ER activation in G2 phase was necessary for cell cycle progression, and localized transient ER in SP contributed to it. Fucci mice expressing m-hemin and KO-C1 were used for cell cycle analysis, excluding melanin granules and autofluorescence. SPs were observed in C57/BL6 and FVB mice, with quantitative analysis hampered by melanin granules in C57/BL. ER activity was regulated by intercellular communication via EGF ligands.
A study on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis elongatus (S. elongatus) was conducted to investigate how its circadian clock responds to light-dark cycles of varying in length. The researchers found that the clock's phase scales linearly with day length, with a slope of approximately 0.5, indicating that it tracks the midpoint of the day. This behavior was observed in both in vivo and in vitro, using a reconstituted Kai proteins. The clock's response to light-dark transitions was decomposed into step-up and step responses, which were linear functions of the phase. The slopes of these responses were tuned to give an entrained phase. A mathematical framework was developed to describe this behavior, assuming a unique cycle in light and dark, rapid relaxation between cycles, and sensitivity varying linear with time. The model predicted the response to various perturbations, such as dark pulses and cycles, and was consistent with experimental data. The study suggests that the clock's ability to track midday is a property of the proteins themselves, not additional mechanisms in the cell, and ensures balanced biosynthetic resources between dawn and dusk genes. The framework has similarities to nonparametric entrainment theory, with instantaneous shifts at dawn and dusk, and can be approximated by linear functions over entrained phases. The slopes of these functions are determinants of entrained phase, along with changes in period and conditions. Successful prediction of the oscillator's entrainment is due to mapping step curves with high resolution. The study holds promise for predicting behavior in time-vary environments from minimal data and may be applicable to clocks in many organisms.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor Me1 (Me1) in the development of the sympathetic nervous system and its impact on heart function. Me1 is a member of the TALE homeobox gene family and plays a crucial role in embryonic development and postnatal cardiomyocyte turnover. The study found that Me1 is not involved in early sympathetic neuron specification, but rather in later stages of development, particularly in target innervation and survival. Inactivation of Me1 in the superior cervical ganglia (SC) resulted in reduced sympathetic innervation of the heart, salivary, vomasal organ, tongue, and trache, and increased apoptosis of sympathetic neurons at E18.5.5. The study also found that Me1 regulates genes involved in endocytosis, exocyt, and vesicle formation, such as Syt, Lnp, Adam, Nbe, and Dst, which are necessary for target innervation and survival. ChIP-seq analysis identified 309 potential Me1 target genes, 34 of which are involved in synapse, target innervation, and cardiac functions/pathologies. The study also found that Me1 is not regulated by retinoic acid (RA) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, but not in sympathetic neurons. Me1 is necessary for the transition from local to target neurotrophic signaling. The study used ChIP to identify Me1 binding sites in SC and found that Me1 binds to genes involved in endocyt, exyt, and vesicle formation. The study also found that Me1 is necessary for target innervation and survival, and its inactivation leads to increased susceptibility to sudden cardiac death (SCD). The study suggests that Me1 plays a crucial role in the development and function of the sympathetic nervous system, particularly in target innervation and survival, and its dysregulation leads to SC.
A study on Vibrio cholera biofilms reveals that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie biofilm morphogenesis. The research combines measurements, theory, and simulation to show that the mismatch between the growing biofilm and the non-growing substrate causes mechanical instabilities that enable the bio to transition from a flat to wrinkled film and subsequently to a partially detached film with delaminated blisters. The instabilities drive the evolution of bio topography. The study demonstrates that interfacial energy is a key force in mechanomogenesis, dictating the generation and annihilation of new and existing interfaces. Feedback between mechanogenesis and bio expansion shapes the overall bio contour. The findings suggest that morphological patterns can involve gene regulation, but mechanical forces also play a crucial role. The study provides a tractable model for investigating the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and a system for morph-engineering. The research has implications for understanding morphogenesis in bacteria and potentially higher organisms, as it reveals links between material properties and morphological transitions.
The study investigates the role of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) in epileptogenesis, a process leading to the development of epilepsy. NRS is a transcription factor that influences neuronal phenotype and is highly expressed in non-neuronal tissues, but its function in mature neurons is not well understood. The study used organotyp hippocampal cultures and rat models of status epilepticus (SE) to examine NRS expression and function. NRS mRNA and protein levels were increased in hippocampus following SE, and blocking NRS function attenuated the epileptic phenotype. Large-scale transcriptome analysis identified hundreds of NR-containing hippocal genes, but only a subset were repressed by NRS in the context of SE. The regulated genes encoded ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and calcium-dependent effectors, and phosphoenzymes, crucial for neuronal function and plasticity. NRS binding to these genes was moderate, not high or low, and increased after SE, suggesting a correlation between occupancy and repression. The study proposes a model where NRS regulates a subset of NR-containing genes with mid-range binding frequencies, allowing moderate fluctuations in NRS levels to influence binding and repression. This concept may apply to other forms of insult-induced plasticity, such as ischemia, peripheral injury, and seizure-induced epilepsy. NRS is distinct from its role in development, where it represses neuronal genes in nonuronal tissues and specifies neuronal fate. The study provides insights into mechanisms of neuroplasticity in mature hippocampus.
Distinct lateral inhibitory circuits in mitral (MC) and tuft (TC) cells in the olfactory bulb contribute to differential responses to odors. MCs receive stronger inhibitory currents and are affected at intermediate firing rates, while TCs are affected at low rates. This difference is due to distinct excitability of subclasses of granule cells (GCs) that preferentially inhibit TCs. MCs. Simulations show that differences in effective range of lateral inhibition, along with intrinsic and circuit differences between MC and TC, cooperatively enable MC and TC to best discriminate similar odors in separate ranges. A combination of MC and TC discriminates odors better than either population. Activity-dependent inhibition (AD) depends on three populations: presynaptic MCs associated with M glomer, inhibitory interneurons, and postsyn MC. Prior work showed increasing firing of presaptic MC shifts range of MC firing influenced by inhibition. TC fire higher rates than MC following glomer activation, contributing to lower bound of effective range lateral in postsyn TC. Analysis supports hypothesis TC and MC preferentially connected to sGC and dGC, respectively. Indirect evidence suggests differences in recruitability of s and d may underlie differences in AD between MC and TC. Data show s spike with higher probability than d following activation of single glomer. Postsyn TC can recruit inhibition at low rates, while d require more input to be activated. Increasing excitability of GC shifts effective range of inhibition in MC to lower rates. Differences between s and d explain upper bound of effective range lateral between MC and TC. Preferential connectivity of TC with s and MC with d may underlie differences in AD. Other mechanisms, such as external layer circuits, may also contribute. Experiments were conducted in compliance with Institutional Care Use Committee guidelines. MC and TC recordings were from postnatal 16-23 M-Ch2R-Y mice, anaesthetized isoflur and decapitated into ice-cold oxygen dissection solution. Sagittal slices 280μm thick of MO were prepared using vibrat. Slices recovered 15-30min in 37 oxygen Ringer solution, then stored in room oxygen Ringer until recording. MC and TC in O-Ch2FP mice, horizontal slices 280μ thick were prepared postnatal 17-21. GC recordings used horizontal 310μ MO from postnatal 28 CBL/6, Thy-Y-G, albino CBL/6, and heterozyg O-ChFP mice vibrat. TC identified as cells with som 10μ diameter in E, with at least one dendrite and no rhythmic bursting. MC as large in MCL, displaced or internal, with som partially in MCL excluded. GC in M or GCL classified as s or d based on apical gemules in E. Cell morph reconstructed under 100 oil, analyzed Neurolida. Anatom positions apical gemules manually from 3 recon using custom Matlab. MC and TC continuously superfused 37 oxygen R with 0.2M Mg unless noted.

The article discusses the allosteric modulation of the M2 muscarinic receptor, a subtype of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPC) family. Alloster modulation is a phenomenon where a ligand binding to one site affects the binding of another ligand to a different site. The M2 receptor has a distinct alloster and orthost sites, with the allo site located at the extracellular surface and the orthost within a cluster of helical domains. Alloster ligands, such as strchn and gall, bind to the allo site and modulate the binding of orthost ligands, such as [H]MS and [HNB. The study used a FRET-based sensor to monitor conformation changes at the allo site and found that allo ligands caused changes in the FRET efficiency, indicating conformational changes at the allo site. The study also used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate allo interactions between allo and orthost ligands and found that electrostatic repulsion dominates intram cooperativity between allo and orthost ligands. The simulations showed that allo lig binding to the allo site precludes association and dissociation of orth lig from the orth site. The study found that oligomers of the M receptor are responsible for high-affinity alloster ligand binding and positive alloster modulation, whereas monomers do not exhibit these effects. The results suggest that oligomers formed by GPCs can mediate alloster communication between agonists and guanyly nucleotides at the G protein. The study used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce substitutions, insertions, and deletions in the M receptor and found that mutations in the allo site affected allo modulation. The study also used time-resolved anotropy to measure the rotational flexibility of eFP fused to the N-termin of the receptor and found that allo lig caused changes in anotropy, indicating conformational changes. The study used confocal microscopy to image intact cells and found that allo lig caused changes in the emission spectrum, indicating conformation changes. The study used simulations to model the binding of orthost lig to monomeric receptor and found that allo precludes association and dissociation of lig from the site. The study found that cooperativity between allo and orth lig is determined by the rate constants for association and dissociation.
This study investigates the role of the histone methyltransferase SET2 (SET2) in the response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human osteosarcoma (UOS) cells and clear cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. SET2 is responsible for trimethylating histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) and is required for the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a critical for the initial steps of the DNA damage response (DDR). Depletion of SET2 by RNA interference (RNAi) impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53-binding protein 1 (53BP) to damaged chromatin. SET2 is also necessary for the formation of RAD51 presyn filaments on single-stranded 3 overhangs, promoting homologous recombination (HR) repair. Depletion of SET2 leads to persistent 5 end resection of DSBs and reduced HR efficiency. SET2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resect DNA, and its depletion results in a 50% reduction in HR efficiency. The study also shows that SET2 is necessary for the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint and survival after DNA damage. Depletion of SET2 abrogates p53 activation and leads to eviction of the G/S checkpoint upon damage. The study provides a link between SET2 and the p53 regulatory network, explaining the observation that inactivation of this regulator in CC is rarely caused by mutations in TP53. The study highlights the importance of histone modifications in maintaining genome stability and the role of SET2 as a tumor suppressor.
A novel missense mutation in the Rasgrp gene, Ras1ef, was identified in a mouse model of autoimmune disease. The mutation, Ras1ef, results in a substitution of glycine for arginine at position 519 in the second EF domain of Ras1, leading to decreased Ras1 activation and ERK phosphorylation in vitro. However, in vivo, Ras1ef mice have normal thym development and peripheral T cell numbers, but exhibit increased CD44 expression on naive CD4 T cells and accumulation of CD44+ Hel+ PD-+ T cells and autoantibodies. The mutation is cell-autonomous, as seen in bone chimer studies where wild-type and mutant cells coexist. Biochemical and genetic studies identify overactive mTOR signaling in naive CD4 cells as a key component of Ras1ef dysregulation. Ras1ef mice have increased CD and P6 expression, which is sensitive to mTOR activity. The mechanism is unclear, but evidence suggests intersections between Ras1/Ras/ER/RS and PI-3kin/mTOR pathways. T-cell deletion of T1, a negative regulator of mTOR, results in increased P and exuber response to T stimulation naive cells. Accumulation of PD+ Hel+ cells in Ras1 mice requires B cells, which may be specialized APCs or require F receptor-dependent antigen presentation. RGRP variants have been associated with autoimmune diseases, including SLE and diabetes. The Ras1ef mouse provides a model for studying RGRP variants and targeting this pathway pharmacologically.
The study investigates the role of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in pancreatic cancer, specifically focusing on the ARID1 subunit, in a mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The researchers used a rapid and robust mouse-model platform to study the consequences of inducible and reversible suppression of AR1 in a model of pancreatic cancer. They found that suppression of AR1 in adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic Kras mutations accelerates acinar duct reprogramming and specification of mucinous pancreatic precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous AR1 expression. This suggests that AR1 can provide a barrier to K-driven acinar duct metaplas and early pancreatic neoplas. The phenotype produced by AR1 depletion in the presence of an oncogenic K mutation is characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility, loss of acinar morphology, reduced expression of ac genes, and upregulation of a characteristic mucinous signature. These features imply genomic regions rendered by AR1 harbor elements involved in preventing ac to duct transdifferentiation in context mutant K, a rate-limiting step in K-driven neoplas. The transcription and chromatin data imply AR1 disruption reduces chrom accessibility of TF enhancers needed to sustain ac cell. One factor, Nr2, physically interacts with SW/S complex via Baf subunit, suggesting a mechanism aberrant Nr2 deregulation upon AR1 loss. Further studies will determine interplay Nr2 and ac TFs underly AR1-depletion. The Pan formation by AR suppression required presence K mutation initiating carcinogenesis, suggesting AR suppression normal pancreas did not perturb ac differentiation during wound responses.
Researchers investigated the effects of social isolation on the biophysical properties of paraventricular nucleus (PV) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in mice. They found that social isolation for 24 hours increased the first spike latency (F) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons in female, but not male, mice. In contrast, acute physical stress (swim) increased F in both group-housed females and single-housed males. Social isolation occluded the effects of swim on female mice. Cortisol (CORT) was necessary for isolation-induced increases in F in females and stress-induced increases in males, and sufficient to increase F in the absence of stress. The effect was graded in female mice, with pair-housed exhibiting intermediate F values between groupoused and single-housed. The underlying conductance was sensitive to millimolar 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and insensitive to millolar tetraethylammonium (TEA). F was sensitive to hyperpolarizing pulses, which removed inactivation and made rapidly inactivating K channels available for opening to depolarization. The features were consistent with Kv4 channels previously described in PV. However, they exhibited a hyperpolarized threshold compared to kinetically similar 4-AP channels in PV parocellular neurosecretory cells. No differences in current density, voltage-dependent activation, or recovery from inactivation were observed. The decay constant of rapidly inactivating currents was longer in female mice compared to males, providing a potential mechanism for prolonged F response to depolar. The F was not classically characteristic of CRH, and absence has been used to categorize putative CR neurons. The biophysical characteristics were flexible and sensitive to specific experiences. Synaptic changes in PV and other regions have been investigated, but this was one of the first reports of rapid plasticity in neurons following stress. Observations added to intrinsic (synapse) plasticity having a profound effect on neural output networks. Electrical fingerprints used to identify cell types should be interpreted with caution, as physiological state may impact. Neurons in PV can express multiple neuromodulators, caution when interpreting data from genetically identified population.
Evolutionary and functional insights into the mechanism underlying body-size adaptation of mammalian hemoglobin

Hemoglobin (H) is a model protein for studying molecular adaptation in vertebrates. Although affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to H affect oxygen delivery, only affinity was thought to determine molecular adaptations of H. Here, we suggest that H affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize oxygen delivery. To test this hypothesis, we derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and relative and conformation parameters of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model and graphed the 'biophysical Hill' landscape describing this relation. We found mammalian H cooperativity values reside on a ridge of cooperativity along this landscape that allows fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body-related adaptation of mammalian H.

The evolutionary origins of protein properties in modern proteins are hampered by the separation of mutation and selection by levels of biological organization, making it difficult to elucidate relationships between sequence and organism/population fitness. Even when properties of a protein (e.g. affinity or cooperativity) have adaptive value to organism fitness, understanding molecular mechanisms underlying values is lacking. Currently, mechanisms of adaptive behavior are understood for limited proteins (e.g. M and Tu, 2005; Key et al,2006; et al,2008; et,2009). H is an excellent protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates (Perutz,1983; et al,1992; et,200; et,2008). H is a tetrameric allosteric protein for oxygen delivery controlled by midpoint and slope of its saturation. Macroscopic parameters reflect affinity (p) and cooperativity (n) of binding H, traditionally evaluated using the Hill equation, assuming all-or mode of binding. Many studies indicated H oxygen affinity (p) an adaptive, its value tuned evolution to tailor oxygen to metabolic of vertebrates due to variations body, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. Vertebrates native mountain habitats low oxygen exhibit H with higher affinity than H low dwellers (Lenfant,197; et,198; Weber,200; et,200; et,201). Small animals display lower affinity than large animals, reflecting adjustment oxygen unloading by H (Schmidt-Neen and,195; Schmidt,197). Respiratory physiologists assigned significance to p, terming 'oxygen unloading' and proposed H function explained by evolution of this value (Schmidt-Ne and,195; Schmidt,197). However, ignored potential of cooperativity (n) respect H function. This surprising, given n affects H tissue delivery. Mechanisms changes p, such as oxygen of oxy- or de-states, ratio or sensitivity alloster effectors, also affect n. Finding by et al (2007) that mammalian H exhibit variations in Hill value hints adaptive of n. Need consider n in addressing adaptation H function evident when examining implications accepting notion adaptation H function verte relies primarily on p property.

We tested values both p and n of H are optimized in body-related adaptation mammalian H, relying evolutionary and physiological oxygen datasets for mammalian H proteins. The comprises oxygen curves of homolog H proteins different mammalian, measured similar conditions (Milo et,200; and Yach,201). The comprises curves of human H under different physiological conditions, including H+, CO, and 2,3-PG (esch et,197; et,198; et,198). For all sets, estimates p and n Hill parameters for elementary and conformation parameters MWC alloster (od et,196; and Change,196) are available. Deriving mathematical dependence p and n on MWC parameters, we graphed 'bi Hill landscape describing relation. Mapping experimentally-derived and physiological datasets on this landscape provided insight underlying behavior p and n with respect oxygen delivery mammalian H and relation fitness.
A longitudinal analysis of Plasmodium sporite motility in the dermis reveals two types of motility: avascular motility and periv motility. Avascular motility is characterized by high speed and less confinement, while periv motility is more constrained. Sporites exhibit avascular motility in far from blood vessels and periv motility in proximity to blood. The curvature of sporite tracks in proximity to blood matches the curvature of dermal capillaries, suggesting periv motility enhances contact with capillaries. Intravital imaging of sporites over 120 minutes after inoculation shows changes in motility over time. Within 20 minutes, sporites displace with high speed and minimal constraint, but after 20 minutes, migratory pattern becomes confined, and many sporites engage circular motility. By 60 minutes, sporites slow down, and proportion of non-mot sporites increases to 70%. The distribution of displacements of sporites is not Gaussian, indicating non-Brownian walk. Once sporites approach blood, linear motility is lost, and sporites switch to periv motility, suggesting host-parasite interaction. Mutant sporites, CSN and TR-VAL, display changes in mot pattern and speed, with decreased blood invasion and infectivity. CSN sporites engage avascular and periv motility like wild-type sporites, but spend more time on vascular endothelia due to constitutive exposure of cell-adhesive domain. TR-VAL sporites spend less time on vessels due to altered proteoly cleavage site. Wild-type sporites spend 25% of time on vessels without entry, suggesting certain areas of vascul are suitable for sporite entry.
This study investigates the evolutionary adaptation of yeast cells to the removal of an important component of the polarization module, BEM, which is essential for cell polarity establishment. The researchers used experimental evolution to remove BEM from yeast cells and observed a reproducible evolutionary trajectory that could be explained by interactions between mutated genes, leading to a substantial recovery in speed and accuracy of polarization. The results show that multiple mutations can restore C42 activity without B1's ability to physically connect C24 and C42, leading to act-independent polarization. The study demonstrates that removing a component of a conserved pathway selects for inactivation of others, potentially leading to an evolutionary shift to a new module. The findings are consistent with previous evolution work showing loss-of-function mutations allow bacteria and yeast to adapt to environments and produce novel phenotypes. Adaptation by loss-function has also been observed in natural populations. The study highlights the importance of understanding the self-organizing properties of modules in the course of evolution and may explain the observation of certain eukotic lineages lacking conserved pathways.
A study investigated the neural mechanisms of economic commitment in the human prefrontal cortex using a task where participants decided to accept or reject stimuli (bandits) based on visual signals (spirals). Participants viewed a spiral of variable length that appeared in one of four boxes (bandits) and chose to commit or defer. Each band's length was drawn from a normal distribution related to its payoff, with six possible lengths: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5. Blocks were divided into three types: short, medium, and long, with two standard deviations of 0.5 and 1.0. Participants chose whether to accept or reject a band, and the per-trial yield was the average of the bandits ruled in or out. Blocks were interleaved in pseudo-random order, and participants received feedback after each block.

The study found a dissociation between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and rostral prefrontal cortex (rmFC) in encoding value. The dACC encoded value when a prospect was rejected or not accepted, while rmFC encoded value when acceptance was deferred into the future. rmFC activity resembled integration neurons that build up to choice and then fall. The rmFC may integrate value across prospective states, calculating the value of investments. The dACC was sensitive to the effect of commit vs defer and correlated with value when rejected or failed to accept a prospect.

The study also found that participants made commitments when the normal band value fell above or below a criterion. Observed criteria differed, allowing the same offer to be perceived as good or bad depending on framing. The misalignment of criteria for acceptance and rejection maximized reward, reflecting a bias towards deferring and exploration. Participants deferred more than committed, with commitments on 15% of rule-in and 22% rule-out trials. Response times were prolonged on commit decisions, with a stronger effect in rule-in blocks.

The ACC was sensitive to the effect of commit vs defer and correlated with value when rejected or failed to accept a prospect. BOLD may have been higher for commit due to a higher threshold for decisions, leading to deliberation and decision activity. The study suggests two biases in choice: additive deferral and exclusion. The d may implement these biases in the task. The findings concur with sensitivity to value difference and reports co-activation with anterior insula.

This study investigated the role of paraspeles in circadian gene expression in pituitary cells. Paraspeles are nuclear bodies that retain RNAs in the nucleus, and their function is not fully understood, but they are believed to control gene expression at the post-transcription level. The study found that parasck components, including PSP1, RB14, NON, SFP, and Ne1, display circadian expression in pitary cells. Insertion of IRu at the 3'UT of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic nuclear retention of egfp mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. Using real-time microscopy, IRu were shown to drive circadian EGFP expression. The study suggests that parasck control circadian expression at the postcription level by retaining RN in the nucleus. The circadian clock orchestrates daily rhythms in metabolism, physiology, and behavior, allowing organisms to anticipate changes in their environment, increasing adaptation. Circadian rhythms are underpinned by rhythms of gene expression, transcriptional component of which is well understood. The circadian in abundance of positive (Clock and Bmal) and negative (Per, Per, and Cry, Cry) components drive circ transcription of direct genome-wide and cascade of circadian transcription factors, which mediate circ transcriptional profile of cell or tissue. The core circadian system has concentrated on transcription control, but substantial regulation is achieved after transcription, postcription controls emerging as modulators of circ clocks. In eukaryotes, approximately 1-10% genes are subjected circadian directly or indirectly, ~1/5 mRNAs display rhythmic are driven directly by transcription, suggesting postcription mechanisms including splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA, stability, cytoplasm export, and nuclear retention are essential for generation expression rhythmic. Parasck are recently identified bodies that retain RN in the nucleus, containing PSP1, RB14, NON, S, and F. They are usually found as variable discrete dots in proximity nuclear. Long noncoding RNA, Ne1, is localized to parasck and serves as structural component. The locus generates short and long transcripts from same promoter which have been identified MEN (Ne1) and MEN(2). Specific depletion Ne2 leads to disruption parasck, Ne alone cannot induce parasck formation. Parasck have retained RN containing duplex structures, case for mouse cation amino transporter 2 (2) transcribed RNA, an alternatively spliced form of 2, contains ds structure from inverted short interspersed elements (S) in 3'UT. In cells, hundreds genes contain repeated S mainly Alu in 3'UT. Alu are unique to primates and account almost of genome. Their leads frequent occurrence inverted structures (inverted Al elements [IRu]) in regions. It reported that mRN containing IRu in 3'UT likeolin 1 (NIC1) or 28 are retained in parasck. Nuclear pathway of IRu in 3'UT of genes provides additional regulation by sequest mature RN within nucleus. The study found two parasck proteins, NON and S, display circadian pattern in pitary cells and pitary line GH1. Used cell line to determine postcription mechanism allowing circadian in pitary could involve circ nuclear retention by parasck bodies. Characterized presence parasck and showed rhythmically expressed in GH1 pitary line. Made series EGFP-IRu or EG-Al constructs transfected into GH1 to investigate EG expression and fates eg-IRu or eg-Al RNA. Shown IRu in 3' of eg strongly repressed EG expression. Further, reduction accompanied by nuclear eg-IR retention. Insertion IR in 3 of EG reporter allowed rhythmic eg-IR retention and EG expression. Rhythmic eg-IR retention as well retention some cycling transcripts associated paras were lost when paras disrupted.
The study investigates the role of the active zone protein Munc in controlling presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) function. Munc is essential for exocyt, the process of neurotransmitter release, and is targeted to the presynaptic membrane, where it interacts with VGs. The study shows that Munc interacts with VGs via its C2 domain, specifically through a synprint motif, and that this interaction modulates VG function. In the absence of M13, VGs fail to recover from inactivation after high-frequency stimulation, leading to reduced Ca2 influx and exocyt. Re-expression of M13 rescues Ca2 influx and exyt in M13D neurons, while a mutant M13R/AA fails to do so, indicating the synprint motif is crucial for M's effects on VGs. The study also shows that M13 enhances Ca influx and modulates VG kinetic properties across various stimulation conditions, implying a direct VG-M interaction. The results have implications for understanding synaptic transmission control and suggest a new class of mechanisms sculpting synaptic efficacy through VG-active protein interactions. The study also provides a mechanistic explanation for synaptic depression at ultra-short ISIs, previously attributed to AP failure, but found to be due to M-mediated VG reactivation failure at physiological temperatures.
The article proposes that puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants emerge from a mechanism to limit mechanical stress in isotropically growing tissues, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. Finite Element (FEM) analysis of 3D pressurized cells shows that cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell. When epider cell becomes large in two directions (i.e., has large area), stress is greatly increased. Stems and roots grow anisotropically, cells can elongate, but isodetric organs such as broad leaves, cotyled, and sil fruit have puzzle-shaped cells to avoid large areas and stresses. Turg pressure inside cells is high, minimizing stress by shape may reduce resources to reinforce cell and maintain structural integrity during growth. Organs displaying isotropic planar growth have puzzle cells, anotropically organs have elongated with fewer lobes. Genetic perturbations modify anotropy result in shape changes. Arabid thalian coton pS::NG overexpression changes from isot to anotropic, cells become elongated with fewer lobes. Sepals of ft4 mutant growth from anotropic to isotropic, elongated cells become puzzle-shaped. The hypothesis is consistent with milding pavement cells in grass, which have anotropic growth. Studies often focus anotropic at cellular when analyzing cell development, but suggest isotropy at tissue is primary driver shape. As tissue grows, stress increases, microtules direct cellulose to resist stress, generating local feedback cell growth via mechanical stresses induced by shape. Geometric-mech model confirms hypothesis plausible, producing puzzle cells from simple assumptions. The model suggests driver of complex shape comes from restriction in indentations rather than promotion in protrusions, triggered by isotropic growth. Puzzle morphogenesis may not require signaling to coordinate protrusion in cell with indentation neighbor. Nonetheless, model does not preclude intercellular signaling, which could patterns by geometry or facilitate initial lobing. Mechanism predicts spatial differences in wall properties, corresponding lob and indent, appear in perinal cell organized cellulose distributions, consistent with cellul-bundles in highress indentations. Spatial differences in stiffness have been measured in cross-section anticinal walls, although direction not represented in model, consistent with material adjacent walls expected different lobe vs indentation. Modeling suggests mechanical drive formation small lob and indent when anticinal under tension. The model is consistent with molecular players influencing puzzle formation, R family GTPases. Elaboration influenced by antagonistic pathways, convex (protrusion) and concave (indentation). R2 and R4 activate R1 suppressing microtule arrays, R4 enhances actin microfibr, promoting growth. R6 activates R1 katan, restricting growth. Coordination struggled to explain protrusions and indent between cells. R2 and R6 believed activated auxin, but scenario unlikely given genetic evidence. Model consistent with R6 stress sensing, stress trigger R6 accumulation. Microtules respond stress planta, curvature mechanism involved, similar villi patterning gutogenesis. Simulations R2-6 co-repression partition cell domains R2 R6 expression. Data suggest intracellular network works with geometric signal transmitted shape.
Researchers have developed a method to observe the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes and the splicing of individual pre-mRNA in human extracts. They found that U1 binding to the 5' splice site is largely unaffected by the presence of U2 sites either downstream or upstream of the 5' site. However, stable U2 binding to the 3' site is accelerated by a 5 site situated either adjacent to the intron or exon. Strikingly, when functional 5 sites are present at both intron and exon locations, they synergistically promote U recruitment. The more than additive effect of flanking 5 sites indicates U employs different mechanisms across introns and exons to accelerate U recruitment. A model suggests that crosson U binding assists in recruiting splicing factors for U binding, while crossin U-U interaction favors U conformation for productive branch engagement. This synergy is crucial for rapid exon definition in multi-intron RNAs, enabling the splicing machinery to avoid skipping.

The researchers generated HEK Tet-Onp-In cell lines expressing fusions of U-70, U', and S114 at endogenous levels. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these cells and labeled with a dye-conjugate. Radioactively labeled preRNA substrate P85 was synthesized in vitro. Two preRNAs carrying 3 biotin were prepared by spligation using oligonucleotides and segments. For single-molecule imaging, RNAs were tethered to a surface at a density of ~0.2-0.5 spots/μm2. Splicing reactions were performed in 40 HE nuclear extract with 60 K-MOPS pH 7.3, 2 ATP, 0.5 DTT, 2 MgO2, 20 glutamate, 5 creatine, and 0.1 E. coli RNA with 20 fm radioactively preRNA. To conditions correspond to SM experiments, bulk assays included 0.9 B cep protocatech dioxygen and 5 protch as O scavenging and 1 Tro as quencher. Anti-U or control were added at 10M concentration and splicing was 20 preincubated 30 prior preRNA addition. After incubating 30 times, splicing was stopped by adding 10 Stop buffer. RNAs were separated by denaturing polyacrylam gel electrophores and phosphimaged. Splicing efficiencies were calculated as ratio spliced product to preRNA at zero.

Single-molecule imaging used a-m total reflection microscope with automatic temperature maintained at 30°C. Streavidin-conjugated beads were tethered to surface as reference for stage correction. RNAs were tethered on surface at density ~0.2-0.5 spots/μ2. When different RNAs were tethered sequentially, microscope was taken after each deposition to identify molecules. Splicing reactions 60 were assembled as bulk assays but without preRNA and introduced into slide by capillary and imaging initiated after loading. For two preRNAs acquired 1 frame every 5 with 633 excitation except beginning and end when acquired frame with 532 excitation. For one preRNAs labeled extracts acquired sequences 100-second frames with 532 exc alternating single frame 633 excitation.
The study reveals a novel ubiquitin-dependent folding system operating on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that promotes the biogenesis of the Wnt coreceptor Low-density lipoprotein Receptor 6 (LRP6). LRP is a type I membrane protein composed of a large extracellular domain with multiple ß-prop and E-like domains, essential for W signaling. Newly synthesized LRP undergoes ubiquitination on a specific lysine (Lys-140), allowing interaction with a putative ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaper, providing time for folding. Deubiquination of L-140 by the deubiquinating enzyme US19 (US19) enables LRP to exit the ER, possibly promoted by palmitlation of cystines in its vicinity. Alternatively, LRP can undergo a new cycle of L-140-specific ubiquination and chaper binding. Prolonged presence in the ER, LRP undergoes polyubiquination on cytosolic lysines, leading to endoplasmic retic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). US19 controls LRP biogenesis, with 18% of newly synthesized LRP molecules surviving 6 hr without US19 and 60% with US overexpression. US19 promotes W signaling, with 50% increase in W capacity in HEK cells and 80% drop in R1 cells with US19 silencing. US19 also controls proteasis of other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, involved in human diseases.
This study investigated sex differences in exploration-exploitation strategies in mice using a restless two-armed bandit task. Males and females showed similar performance, but employed different exploration-exploitation strategies to learn the environment. Males explored more and were more likely to get stuck in extended exploration before committing to a choice. Females were more likely to show learning during exploration, making it more efficient and allowing them to exploit a choice earlier. The learning rate increased over days in females but stayed in males. Meta-learning in females permitted learning current and task structure, allowing them to shift quickly exploit a rewarding option when found and only explored when current failed to provide rewards. These results demonstrate males and females adopted different strategies interacting with the uncertain environment. The difference in exploration-explo strategies may provide insight into sex-modulated mechanisms implicated in learning under uncertainty. Males learned less during exploration and explored longer, consistent with two explanations: slower learning during exploration and getting stuck in extended periods. Females learned more during exploration, making it efficient and allowing to exploit earlier. The study used Hidden Markov model (HMM) to infer exploration-explo states, which explained variance in neural activity better than decision-variables. Reinforcement learning (RL) models identified exploration levels across individuals, but multiple parameters influenced exploration. The study combined H and RL approaches linked changes exploration to mechanisms. Dopamine, implicated in learning and exploration-exploitation, is sex-modulated. Females had increased learning during exploration, possibly due to estradi effects on dopamine release and clearance. The prefrontal cortex, receiving dopamine, is involved in exploration-exp strategies. Rodent tasks are species-specific, but the restless band task assesses cognitive processes across species, making it translational. Approaches in humans examined explore-exp phenotype in neuropsych disorders, including ADHD, addiction, and depression.
The study investigates the role of the ubiquitin ligase Do10 (Do10) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a process that removes misfolded, unassembled, and mistargeted proteins from the ER into the cytos for proteasomal degradation. Do10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 transmembrane (TM) segments, and its substrates include single- and multi-span membrane proteins of the ER and inner membrane, as well as soluble cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins. The study uses a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of Do10 in protein retrolocation, a process where proteins are moved from the ER into the cytos. Do10 is shown to be a retrolocase, facilitating the movement of a tail-anchored membrane protein into the aqueous phase in the presence of Do10. In the absence of a folded luminal domain, factors such as Get or antibody trap the retrolocated state are sufficient to drive the reaction, bypassing the requirement for ubiquination and C48. ERAD also involves retrolocation of hydrophobic sequences, such as luminal or domains, across the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The study shows that once dissociated streptavid, a 57 amino long luminal protein with SB-tag is retrolocated by Do10 without affecting retrolocation kinetics. Do10 can accommodate lessph sequences in the retrolocation process. The study also investigates the fate of luminal domains during retrolocation, with some suggesting that they cross the membrane in a folded state, while others require unfolding prior to retrolocation. The study proposes that membrane-bound retrolocases contribute to AAA-driven protein extraction of membrane proteins in various organelles, including the Golgi, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The study provides insights into the mechanism of ERAD and the role of Do10 in retrolocation, with implications for protein quality control and disease.
Drosophila Hedgehog (H) signaling plays a crucial role in development and tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Aberrant H production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental defects and cancer, including holoprosphaly, limb abnormalities, and basal cell carcinoma. Understanding the basic mechanisms of H communication is key to combating these disorders. The H pathway was initially identified in Dophila and found to have mammalian orthologs, including the transducing protein Smooed, which is a target of several anticancer drugs. However, there are differences between Dila and mammalian H signaling, and the pathway is not fully understood. To study the molecular mechanisms in Dila, which is well-suited for precise and genetic tests under physiological conditions, H signaling depends on a set of protein interactions to elicit transcriptional and de-repression of H target genes through Cubitus (Ci), the transcription factor of the pathway. H can act as a morph that signals through Ci to transcribe different H target products depending on ligand at the cell membrane. In third instar Dila wing discs, H is expressed in posterior cells and Ci only in anterior, so H signals a band of anterior cells at the anterior-posterior (AP) border with strength declining from posterior to anterior. H controls activity by regulating processing, activation, and degradation of full Ci (Ci-155). In the absence of H, ligand, Patched (P) inhibits the actions of transmembrane Smoo (Sm), which is present at low levels and associated with vesicles. Costal (Cos) a kines-family protein complexed Fused (Fu) acts as a scaffold to bring Protein Kinase (PKA), Glyogenase Kinase-3 (GSK), and Caseinase Kin-1 (CK) to Ci-155 and facilitate phosphorylation of Ci-155 at series PK, CK, and SK sites. This creates a binding for Slim, substrate component of Cul-SC ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes Ci-155 ubiquination and partialysis to repressor (Ci-75). Ci-75 lacks the C-terminal of Ci-155, which includes transcriptional activation and epitope for monoclonal antibody 2. Ci-75 silences transcription of dpp in anterior cells and ectopic dpp in anterior cells. H binding to P leads Sm activation, phosphorylation by PK, CK, G-protein-coupled kinase 2 (Gk2), Sm accumulation at membrane and change in Sm conformation oligomerization. Enhances likely the binding of Sm to Cos-Fu complexes, with important consequences. First, Ci-155 processing is inhibited due to titration Cos away from Ci-155 and partialation of PK, CK, or SK from Cosu. Second, Cos-associated molecules are brought to crossosphory activate loop, leading full Fu kinase activity. Activated Fu is critical for full Ci-155 activation. Ci-155 is maintained inactive in cytoplasm through associations with Suppressor fused (Su) and Cos. Fu associations but not activity are required for Ci-155 processing; role of activity in Ci-155 is studied in isolation by point mutations in kinase that eliminate activity reduce Ci-155 activation. Processing Ci-155 at the AP border of wing discs is graded, with a profile similar to p-lac activation. Ci-155 levels peak at the middle of AP and decline over posterior. The profile is dependent on strong H pathway activity and absent in pathway mutants. Ci-155 reduction is attributed to transcription induction of Road (Rdxib), which binds Ci to promote degradation and limit H target induction. However, other studies suggest Ci levels remain low in high H territory with Rdx activity eliminated, and Rdx may influence Ci indirectly through modulation Su protein levels. A Ci variant with alterations to Rdx association showed Ci reduction likely depends on
This study investigated the role of calretinin-expressing (CR) interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in pain processing. The researchers used optogenetic approaches to selectively activate or inhibit CR interneurons in mice and assessed behavioral and electrophysiological responses. They found that CR interneurons form an excitatory network that contributes to pain signaling and amplify signals in the absence of peripheral input. The interne interconnectivity of this population in the dorsal horn means they are positioned to alter sensory information before relay to higher centers. Photostimulation of CR interne elicited behavioral responses consistent with pain, including nocif licking, biting, and lifting. The study also found that CR interne interconnectivity changes under neuropathic conditions to become more excitable, suggesting they may contribute to symptoms of neuropathic pain. The researchers used a spared nerve injury model to induce neuropath pain in mice and found that CRne photost responses were enhanced. They also used conditioned place aversion testing to assess the aversive nature of CRne photost and found it to be aversive. The study suggests that CR interne play a critical role in pain processing and may be a target for analgesia.
The study investigated the role of Ras-associated protein 23 (RAB23) in the development of the calvarial suture, which is crucial for skull formation and morphogenesis. R23-deficient mice were generated that survived into late gestation and exhibited multiple suture craniosostosis. The study found that R23 regulates the sutural stem cell marker GL1, represses hedgehog (H) signaling, and inhibits osteopitor expansion. R23 also represses F10-driven ERK/2 signaling, which regulates osteopitor development, RUN2 differentiation, and repress GL1. The results suggest that R23 coordinates suturegenesis by regulating F-ER/2-RUN2 activity and GL1. The study used primary cells and organ culture approaches to investigate developmental events. F10 regulates osteogenesis and is expressed in osteogenic condensation and implicated in craniosotic pathogenesis. F10, its receptor FGFRb, and F activator Pit2 are upregulated in R-deficient calia. FG1 isoform is expressed in epithelia, but upregulated in mesymal s. The study analyzed MAP pathway in R-def lamboid s and found decreased p38 and elevated ER1/2. FG activation of ER1 is important in osteogenesis, including osteop proliferation and RUN2 induction. ER1 regulates RUN2 six times more efficiently than p38. The study reversed the craniosotic phenotype in R-def mice. p has been implicated in skullotypes cranotic where it regulates cartilage development. Opposing roles of MAP subtypes p and ER1 in cartilage are documented. Common etiological mechanisms suggested by overlapping phenotypes in Carpenter and Grecephalysndyndy syndromes and their models. Postax polydly in forelim, preax polyly hindlim, and lamboid interfront s cranios are overlapping phenotypes aberrant F and H signaling. Aberr osteogenesis and s obliteration in G3tJtJ mouse caused conitant derepression GL3 and augmentation I activating RUN2. Analysis early R-def suggests R promotes GL repressor. F upulates H and Patch during facial development. F upulates RUN2. Inhibition ER prevented R-def suture by decreasing osteop proliferation and GL1. Combined inhibition GL and ER1 in R-def cells downregulated RUN2 and GL. Phenotypic compound R;Smthen early mice R regulates GL independently Smthen. Non-can regulation GL through tyrosine activity has been documented carcinogenesis. The study shows R repress both F and H/GL signaling. R coordinates s morph and pat through three mechanisms: F-ER2, repression H canonical, and repression GL1 by ER2. GL1 regulates mesal stem niche F-ER and H/GL regulate osteop cell proliferation.
This study investigates the epigenetic inheritance of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically focusing on the Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). The authors aim to determine whether epigenetic memory is stored in cis (in the chromatin environment of the gene) or trans (in diffusible factors). They use a system where two copies of FLC are expressed in the same cell, one tagged with Venus and mCherry fluorescent proteins, to distinguish between cis and trans epigenetic inheritance. FLC is epigenetically repressed in response to cold exposure, and this repression is dependent on the F-specific sequences within the transgenes, not their genomic location. The authors observe long-term mitotic stability of all possible combinations of ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF expression states, contradicting trans memory and providing evidence of cis-encoded epigen state F. They conclude that molecular changes to the chrom environment of FLC induced by cold are sufficient to instruct epigen inheritance of Poly-repressed transcription state, and that not all H3-methylated chromatin should be considered epetically silent. The methodology using two reporters to distinguish cis vs trans is broadly applicable and should be helpful in the pursuit of what defines a chrom environment sufficient to confer cis-based epigen memory.
**Physiological modulation of BiP by transprotomer of the interdomain the ER Hsp70 chaper form oligomers poorly understood and functionally significant Site proteolysis and crosslink were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the ER Hsp70 chaper, BiP. These oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain of one in substrate another, attenuating chaper function of Bi. Native electrophores revealed a reciprocal relationship between burden of proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration of oligomers and inactive BiP. ER depletion caused oligomer of mammalian Bi and coincident diminution of substrate binding, pointing to relative inertness of oligomers. Thus, equibration between oligomers and active monomeric Bi poised to buffer fluctuations ER protein load on rapid timescale neither interconversion active or coval-modified Bi nor conventional protein response. The ER processes vast majority of newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion and maturation requires chaper assisted folding of nascent chains and assembly of functional complexes. Protein homeostasis in ER requires complement of chaper closely match the burden of nascent: too few chaper risks misfolding and proteotoxicity, whereas too chaper slows folding impedes cell growth and incurs excessive protein degradation. The challenge in ER especially great as the compartment experiences physiologically driven fluctuations in client load. This dynamism also renders ER a window into general principles maintain protein homeostasis. Importance of transcription regulation ER chaper-encoding genes recognized and signal transduction pathways couple unfolded stress to expression, the unfolded response ( UPR), have been worked out in detail. Inherent transcription favored evolution of an additional strand to the UPR, coupled ER stress to rapid attenuation protein synthesis. Translation is effective against misfolding and proteotoxic, but caps biosynthetic yield activity. Limitations of transcription and translational UPR generated interest in posttransl adaptations with latency rapidly matching chaper availability client load. One such adaptation, unique to ER, is reversible AD ribosylation and de-ribosylation of H70 chaper, Bi. AD ribosylated Bi locked in inactive with low affinity for substrates. AD ribos affects residues interfere with alloic of ATP binding and hydrolysis in Bi's nucleotide domain (NBD) to affinity of substrate domain (S) for unfolded proteins, targeting basic chaper mechanism used by H70/DK family members. A study reveals the same circumstances promote AD ribylation of Bi also associated with reversible formation AMPylation, inactivating modification. Covalent modification represents a buffer that can be drawn in time of need, by removal, increasing ER capacity to cope with enhanced protein while minimizing overchoning. Interconversion of AD ribylated and AMPyl Bi to unmodified follows a pattern increased client load converting inactive to active and diminished protein pushes modification. Transitions occur on timescale ∼1 hr, allowing rapid adaptations. One potential adaptation oligomerization. Oligomerization of Bi, H70 and D, has been observed in vitro and in cells. Oligomers have attenuated client capability and convert to active monomer, suggesting they represent a rapidly accessible inactive form chaper. Alloic coupling the domains of H70 proteins modulated by nucleotide binding to regulatory BD. In ATP-bound, domains juxtaposed and hydrophobic sidechains of linker exposed to solvent in AD-bound, mediating alloic transitions. Here, we report application of chemical probe to interdomain of Bi and site-specific crosslink to analyze disposition of Biomers in vitro and in cells, revealing a mechanism for rapid reversible Bi oligomerization inactivating chaper to serve as recoup storage.
Researchers have determined the near-atomic structure of a filamentous plant virus, Pepino virus (PepMV), a member of the Potyviridae family, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryEM) at 3.9 Å resolution. The structure reveals a left-handed helix with a diameter of 130 Å and an inner channel of 13 Å, with a pitch of 34.6 Å and 8.7 copies per turn. This helical arrangement is consistent with previous studies on other potyviruses. The cryEM map allows for accurate modeling of the coat protein (CP) and its interactions with viral RNA. The CP of PepMV has three regions: a core, N-terminal arm, and C-terminal extension. The N-terminal arm is not included in the atomic model due to its flexibility. The structure of PepMV CP is similar to that of Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) CP, with an all-helix fold and low RMSD of 1.5 Å in the core region. The C-terminal of PepMV protrudes from the core, allowing longitudinal interactions for helix building, whereas the C-terminal of phle virus folds back into the core and participates in RNA binding.

The researchers also found structural homology between PepMV CP and nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus family, a group of enveloped viruses with segmented (-)RNA. The topology of CP from potviruses and NPs is similar, with an overall all-helix domain, N-terminal arm, and side-by oligomerization, and groove for RNA binding. The divergence is in C-terminal regions, with Pep CP C-terminal protruding and phle NP folding back into the core. This suggests a horizontal gene transfer between Potvir and Phlevir or evolutionary forms.

The researchers tested Pep CP mutants in trans-complementation assays and found that three amino acids at the pocket for nucleotide position 2 (R, D, and K) are required for cell-to-cell movement. Mutant K also impairs viral propagation within inoculated leaves. The production of fully virions was only fruitful for wt and QA mutant. Single amino changes impair CP-RNA interaction, including cooperative between hundreds of CP building virions. The assembly of Pep is mediated by N-terminal and C extension. The N-terminal from sub interacts with hydrophobic groove of subunit and establishes side-by contact in helical arrangement. The C-terminal builds inner wall of virus, creating a network of local interactions.

The study provides insights into the structure and function of filamentous plant viruses and their evolutionary relationships with other viruses.
Researchers have developed a method for imaging-based localization of binding sites on cellular proteins with nanometer precision. The method, called Site, uses topological averaging to determine the distance between a ligand and a reference signal on the surface of a cell. This is achieved by calculating the average distance between the ligand and reference signal along the contour of the cell. The method was tested on simulated images with varying surface morphology and staining, showing high accuracy for different topologies and inhomogeneous expression. In vitro, the method was used to measure the height of DNA on erythrocyte surfaces, validating its ability to estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells. The method was also applied to determine binding locales on protein unevenly expressed on the surface of Streptoccus pyogen. Results showed that the method is suited for cells with nonpherical topology. However, localization on bacteria was challenging due to their small size. The method yielded viable results with conventional microscopy and precision increased by deconvolution of wide images. In silico experiments and in vitro indicated that variation in measurements can be minimized by increasing SNR and minimizing biological variability, such as using directly conjugated antibodies. The method may be useful for rapid epitope screening and is implemented in open-source language Julia on GitHub.
Cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia and the role of peripheral resistance: Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a range of factors, with peripheral resistance in capillary beds playing a key role. The relationship between central control of flow and peripheral resistance is unclear, particularly in response to hypoxia. This study demonstrates how hypoxic response in the skin, via HIF transcription factors, influences cardiovascular response to hypia in mice. The skin's response to hypia affects a range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and temperature. This is the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in peripheral tissues modifying cardiovascular response to hypia. Vertebrates confront the world through the skin, with skin varying significantly between vertebrate classes and orders. Mammalian skin is the most complex, with adaptations to environment. A key challenge faced by multicellular organisms is oxygen supply, particularly in water or high altitudes or confined spaces. Hypia occurs in tissues with high oxygen demand, such as skeletal muscle during exercise. Acute hypia in mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, dogs, sheep, and humans causes tachardia and hypertension. Prolong hypia in humans causes tachard and hypertension. The skin has a vasculature responsive to oxygen shifts, with keratinocytes releasing nitric to improve perfusion. Keratin HIF-α and H-α are constitutively stabilised in basal epider, with H-α stabilised in dermal. HIF transcription initiates transcription of genes involved in oxygen homeasis, including vascular and metabolism. H-α/N2 and H-α/arginase pathways influence L-argin consumption and NO generation. Keratin HIF-α deletion reduces epider NO, while H-α suppresses argin expression and increases NO. In this study, mice with conditional H1, H-α, H-2, N2, and Arg1 deletions in keratin show changes in blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate. The response to hypia is triphasic, with an initial tachard and hypertensive phase, followed by bradycard and hypotension, and recovery to normia. The skin plays a role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypia, with H-α and H- influencing peripheral resistance and heart rate.
Researchers have developed a new method for mapping neural circuits with single-cell resolution using a combination of temporal focusing two-photon activation of channelrhodops (Ch2) and restriction of Ch2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This approach allows for unmasking synaptic connections from neurons whose somata lie close to the dendrites of postsynaptic cells and prevents inadvertent depolarization of boutons or fibers of passage that could compromise identifying the source of synaptic events. Ch2 harboring the Kv.1 localization showed enhanced sensitivity, which is useful in situations where excitation power is a premium. The soma-restricted construct significantly enhances the ability to map connections with single resolution. The distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels defines a subcellular along soma and proximal dendrites, and the sufficiency of short Kv.1 sequence for heterologous to this region made this strategy for restricting Ch expression. The AIS-targeted Ch2 does not support light-generated potentials under physiological conditions and alters intrinsic properties of retinal neurons. The Kv. targeting remains optimal for concentrating Ch2 that potentials not generated by TF stimulation dend >20m away from soma. This approach has been used ops to generate center-surround receptive fields in retinal ganglion cells. The study measured somatic targeting at finer scale, two-photon excitation targeted Ch2 is relative to normal Ch under same conditions and established utility of ops for local maps neural circuits. The-targeted Ch could be combined with techniques for optical control of activity developed for neurotransmitters or optogen probes. The merit depends on resolution, precision, and number to be stimulated in paradigm. Rapid scanning diffraction twooton spot can generate potentials, and combination light modulators excite ensembles. Temporal precision is limited by scanning time along cell. Scan activation untarget Ch in brain using TF or mod can generate potentials within 1-3ms light. The study focused on method to identify connections without optimizing power that fire presaptic with latency. Longer pulses were chosen to fire most and generate trains, which elicit stronger indicators. Experiments requiring precision minimize latency optimize exc area and power. Power is also limiting extending activation large numbers with modulators. The performance relies co-expression of op, marker, and calcium sensor. GCa6 and similar sensors balance expression to detect action and excessive levels lead lack. Targeting window can be complicated, particularly high op levels using separate AAV. Heterogeneity GC levels between infection may be responsible 20 neurons not detect change. The sensitivity alleviates concern sufficient expression single locus activation. Opportunities extend this approach to other ops, such as C1, red-shift ReCh, and Chron. The somatic restriction membrane-bound sensors reduce background and all-optical. The Kv sequence restricts single membrane protein CD, structural constraints effectiveness. The combination TF and soma-restricted Ch enables connectivity straightforward and implement standard microscopes. These could be used in vivo, especially attractive selective stimulation paradigms. Enhancements probing microcircuit through stimulation reveal nervous function and modified animal models disease.
Chen et al. investigated the interaction between transcription factors Sox2 and Oct4 on the genome using single-molecule techniques. They found that Sox and Oct exhibit negative reciprocity, meaning that the binding of Sox decreases when Oct is induced and vice versa. The authors analyzed the data using a biophysical model and found that the reciprocity can arise from either energy expenditure or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at genomic loci. The single-loc model shows that Sox and Oct exhibit positive cooperativity at some loci and negative at others, leading to negative reciprocity. The genomic-divers model allows for two types of loci with different cooperativities, leading to negative reciprocity. The authors conclude that the data provide evidence for energy expenditure behind the scenes or mixed cooperativity across the genome. They suggest that single-molecule data, coupled with experimental strategy, provides more information than expected and that a number, -0.22 can suggest Sox and Oct exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across loci in vivo. The implications of this finding need to be addressed in future studies.
This study investigates the detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species that lacks an adaptive immune system. Researchers found that Drosila display aversive responses to L and identified gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 receptors as mediating avoidance of L in feeding and egg-laying assays. Expression of the chemosensory channel TR1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. L stimulates Drosila neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells. The study demonstrates that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism. Previous research has shown interactions between the immune and nervous systems, with sensory neurons detecting bacterial components as damaging stimuli and initiating inflammatory responses. L, a Gram-negative bacterial wall component, induces hygien grooming in Dila, an important defense against pathogens via chemensation. L may represent sensory cues of contamination with Gram-negative bacteria. To test if L can be perceived by flies during food ingestion, a binary choice assay was used. Control flies displayed significant avoidance of food supplemented with L. L is non-volatile, so determined if avoidance is mediated by gustatory neurons known to detect aversive compounds Gr66. Blocking transmission in these neurons by tetanus toxin abolished L avoidance, indicating flies detect L through a gustatory mechanism. TR1 is expressed in a subset of Gr-expressing neurons that can be directly stimulated by L. Immunofluorescence analysis shows Gr-I-GFP, U-R;TrA-Gal probis anti-G immunohisto labels taste neurons while anti-R labels TR-express cells. High magnification of esophage neurons expressing Gr and TR shows different clusters of Gr-express present in different segments. Higher magnification shows no R expression in GFP-express cells. The probis extension reflex was not altered by L, suggesting avoidance is not mediated by labellar neurons but gustatory of esophagus. Ca2 imaging was attempted in Gr neurons but access proved impossible. Direct brain stimulation preparations responded to TR1 agonist ally isothiocyanate and caffeine, indicating healthy neurons. However, L gave varying results, precluding conclusions. To further test TR1 mediates responses in vivo, intracellular Ca dynamics were monitored in ventral cord larvae. Application of L or TR1 agonist induced Ca responses that were reduced by TR1 inhibitor HC031. In contrast, HC031 did not affect responses to depolarizing solution with high K concentration. TR1 is expressed in plasma membrane mediates at least of Ca influx by L in Dila neurons. Other receptors may also be sensitive to compounds in cultured neurons, as shown in previous studies. TR1 is activated by L in HEK293 heterologous system, with few responses in nonfected cells but significantly more in transfected with TR1-A or TR-B. Currents were enhanced by L in TR1 transfected cells but not control. HC031 reduced currents in presence L, confirming TR-dependence. The study demonstrates Dila possess a gustatory mechanism detecting and avoiding L. Avoidance of L-contaminated food during feeding and eggaying may prevent Gram infections, compensating lack of immunity. TR exploits a conserved principle channels play role in L detection sensory neurons flies and mammals, regardless modality.
The study identifies a novel role for the zinc finger protein Zfp in regulating T cell maturation. Mice with a hypomorphic mutation in the C2H zinc finger of Zfp exhibit a naive T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect beginning in the thymus and continuing in the periphery, affecting T cells that have undergone thym egress. The defect is not due to thym selection, proliferation, or IL-7α expression, but is associated with reduced viability of mature thym and thym emigrants. Overexpression of Zfp rescues the defect in peripheral T cells. ChIP-seq analysis identifies 157 Zfp-binding regions in the vicinity of 177 genes, enriched in promoters and upstream of transcription start sites, associated with high H3K3me3, low H3ac, and repressive H3me3 marks. Reduced Zfp binding is observed in bl/bl thymocytes for a subset of targets, including An2, N6, and Mr5. A novel 22 bp bipart motif is identified by de novo analysis of Zfp Ch-seq peaks, with distinct DNase footprint and sequence conservation. Gel shift assays confirm Zfp binding to labeled oligonucleotides containing the motif. Overexpression of An2 in bl/bl mice partially rescues T maturation. Other Zfp targets, including Cpy, N6,15, Tb, and W47, do not show significant rescue. The study highlights the importance of Zfp in T cell maturation, similar to its role in brain development.
Avoidance of stochastic interactions between messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is a conserved in prokary genomes, indicating selection against deleterious outcomes on expression. This study investigates the evolutionary conservation of avoidance using 256 sequenced bacterial and 240 archaeal genomes. Core mRNAs and ncRN were extracted from Phyco and Rf databases, respectively. The first 21 nucleotides of mRN showed strongest signal in small-scale analysis and were used for analysis. RNAup algorithm calculated minimum Gibbs free energy (FE) of mRNA:RNA interactions. Dinucle frequency shuffled sequences were used as negative control, showing conservative MFE distribution. Nonparam one-tailed Mann-Whitney test showed significant difference between native and shuffled distributions in 73% of genomes, indicating selection for avoidance. G difference between ncRN and mRN was also significant in 95% of genomes. Intrinsic avoidance was tested by comparing MFE of native and shuffled interactions throughout SS ribosomal RNA of T. thermus, showing significant relationship between avoidance and accessibility. Meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data from E. coli and P. aerugin showed avoidance correlates with protein abundance, explaining up to 70% of variation in GFP expression. A set of GFP constructs with same G content, cod adaptation index (CA), and internal structure but high or low avoidance was designed, synthesized, transformed, and expressed. Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant difference in fluorescence between high and low avoidance constructs. Spearman correlation showed avoidance highest correlation with GFP expression, followed by secondary structure and concentration. Avoidance is conserved and correlated with protein abundance, and can be used to design sequences modulating protein abundance predictably.
This study investigated the dynamics of neuromuscular junction (NM) remodeling in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using in vivo imaging of single motor axons and their NMJs over a three-month period. The results show that motor units (MUs) are dismantled asynchronously in SODG37 mice, a model of ALS, prior to complete axonal degeneration. Before axonal degeneration, axonal branches are dismantled accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first NM, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. The study reveals that NM denervation in ALS is a complex process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of global motor neuron degeneration.

The study used longitudinal in vivo imaging of single neuron axonal arbors and their NM to assess the course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression. SODG37 mice were crossed with animals expressing a cytoplasmic marker in a random subset of motor neurons (ThyFP line) to visualize and follow single MUs. Imaging was performed on the Tibialis muscle, where numerous NMJs can be observed near the surface. Postsynaptic sites were identified by staining nicotinic receptors with fluorescently labeled α-bungotoxin. Imaging sessions were performed at 2-week intervals for up to 5-6 sessions (56-76 days). The same MU and NM were identified through unique pretzel shape of NM, branching of motoron, and position of postsynaptic sites. NM were classified based on innervation status over time.

The study found that same MU and NM were reliably imaged over weeks without structural damage. Single MUs in WT mice showed Y-labeled axons overlapped with ACh-rich postsyn sites over all sessions. In symptomatic SODG mice, Y-labeled terminals retracted from A-richyn sites while ax branches remained overlapped. Most MUs in SOD mice behaved similarly, losing NM over sessions rather than abruptly. NM loss starts as a slow process occurring independently of ax degeneration. A number of visualized axons and NM were lost in a synchronous manner, reflecting global degeneration. Signs of NM denervation preceded MU degeneration.

The study also found that MUs in SOD mice sprouted toward A-rich postsyn sites, forming new contacts on fibers they did not innervate. These expansions resulted in net increase MU size masking contemporaneous NM loss. Half of analyzed MUs lost and formed NM throughout the process. There was inverse relationship between propensity of branches to be lost or expand. Proximal branches preserved capacity to reinnate heterolog NM despite degeneration dist branches. Few M reinnated own NM and partial losses were not repaired. Immunabeling showed some lost NM were reinnated by other M.

The study examined spatial and temporal relationship den events within MU. Local signals from muscle, glial, or damaged branch could propagate through extracellular and contribute NM loss. Sh-like analysis showed den tended to propagate from first NM. The study reveals propagation pattern suggests factors extrinsic motor interact intrinsic properties to shape NM loss in ALS. Overall, the study reveals dynamics at NM in ALS, highlighting a temporal window between branch dismantling and degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited.
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been used to treat hormone-responsive breast cancer for over 40 years, but has side effects such as hot flashes, fatigue, and bone loss. To understand the mechanisms behind these effects, researchers used mice as a model to study tamoxifen's physiological effects. They found that tamox increased heat dissipation, decreased movement, and bone density in mice, similar to humans. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed tamox altered transcriptomes in the hypothalamus-PO, a central for sex action and temperature regulation. Tamox treatment affected gene expression in many cell types, most strongly in neurons and ependal cells, consistent with previous reports. Conditional knockout of Es1, encoding ER, did not render brain insensitive to tamox, but ablated or reversed direction of significant gene changes in wild-type hypothalam-PO. Many pathways, including metabolism and neurope signaling in neurons, were affected. The transcription changes in Es1KO mice might be due to tam's effects on other receptors or cells outside Nk-1 lineage. Studies suggest other pathways, such as P androgen receptor, may be involved in tam's actions. P expression in hypothalam is regulated by estrogens and tamox, and is abundant in neurons. Conditional of ER in hypothalamPO blocked majority of physiological changes in wild mice, indicating ER's role in mediating homeostatic effects tamox. Data indicate ER's indispensable role in molecular and physiological response tamox treatment mice. Tamox exerted effects on gene in various neuronal subtypes and ependal, suggesting pleotropic effects involve responsive cells and brain. Determining regions and nuclei mediating effects requires region and cell-specific Es1 studies. Hot flashes, common in tamox therapy or menopause, characterized by sudden heat dissipation, sweats, and transient core decrease. Mechanisms unknown, but disruption central sex signaling involved. HypothalamPO central for sex action and thermoregulation, plays role in hot etiology. Activating ARC neurons coexpressing kisspein, neuroin B, andorphin, or downstream neuroin B PO induces hot-like symptoms in rodents and humans. Highest Es1 expression in Tac neurons, tamox may interact neuroin B through ER ARC or PO. Es1KO loss in ARC and PO did not exhibit tamox-induced tail and core changes. Data suggest tamox induces hot via estrogen-sensitive circuits in thermoreg. Other ERs contribute effects thermg, such as ligands ER and G-coupled receptor. Effects estrog on thermg multifaceted and complex, but ablating ER sufficient abrogate tamox effects core and skin mice. Estrogen promotes movement, but controversial in humans. Female cancer patients, significant association between tamox usage and fatigue. ER in hypothalamPO mediates suppressive effect tamox movement. Consistent with ER signaling in hypothalamPO regulates physical mice. PO rich ER, responsible estrogen running activity. ER primarily regulates physical mice. Tamox act antagonist in estrogen-sensitive regions suppress physical mice. Tamox effects bone, human studies protective after menopause, but loss before men. Animal studies generally protective, regardless ovarian function. Discrepancies between rodent human biology. Tamox increased bone wild-type, estrogen-like effect. Did not detect effect Es1KO, observed changes trabular number compared wild. Suggest least effects mediated ER signaling N-1. ER outside N-1 or estrogen subtypes contribute wild mice. E replacement ovari increase cortical dimensions ER and ER double KO. G-coupled ligand increase density guinea ovari. Depletion ER basal hypothalam or ND neurons impressive mass. Hypothamic ER strongest estrog effects consistent with conditional ablation hypothalamPO tam effects. Peripheral tissues affected systemic tam administration, other effects not examined.

The study investigates the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) in the innate immune response to Listeria monocytogen infection. IS15 is a diubiquitin-like protein that has been implicated in antiviral immunity, but its role in antibacterial infections is unclear. The study shows that IS15 is induced in nonphocytic cells in response to Lister infection and that this induction is independent of type I interferon signaling. IS15 induction is mediated by the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA through STING, TBK, IR3, and IR7. The study also shows that IS15 restricts Lister infection in vitro and in vivo, and that conjugation is required for this effect. The study identifies 30 ISylated proteins, including those involved in ER and Golgi function, and shows that ISylation of these proteins leads to increased cytokine secretion, which counteracts infection. The study suggests that IS15 plays a critical role in the innate response to Lister infection and that its induction may explain the resistance of interferon receptor-deficient mice to Lister infection.
Single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smRET) is a powerful method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation have outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, and automated methodologies to analyze the wealth of produced data. DeepRET, an open-source software based on deep learning, automates the analysis of smRET data with minimal human intervention. The software integrates standard features of smRET analysis and outputs common kinetic metrics. Its accuracy on ground truth data reached >95%, outperforming human operators and commonly used thresholds, requiring ~1% of the time. Its rapid operation on real data demonstrates DeepRET's capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology.

DeepRET is based on a convolutional neural network that recognizes spatial features in data. The model is pre-trained on 150,000 simulated traces that sample all possible FRET states, lifetimes, occupancies, and pathways, and noise. DeepRET treats both alternating excitation (ALEX) and non-ALEXRET data. It imports microscope images, performs colocalization of channels, extracts corrected intensity traces, and stoichiometry, and predicts six categories: bleached, static smRET, dynamicRET, aggregate, noisy, scrambled, and other. The user interface automates common smRET procedures: raw analysis, particle detection, localization, intensity extraction, classification, sorting, and analysis of FRET states and lifetimes.

DeepRET was tested on simulated and experimental data. On simulated data, it outperformed SPAN, iSMS, and ebRET. On experimental data, it matched manual selection and outperformed ebRET and HMY. DeepRET's performance was evaluated on ALEX and nonLEX data from other groups. The software was able to reproduce published F distributions with little discrepancy. DeepRET offers interoperability with txt files from iSMS and export to publication-quality figures. The open-source code is based on Num, Sci, Matplotlib, allowing users to adjust pipel analysis.

DeepRET is designed to fill the void of automated and reproducible analysis across laboratories. The model generalizability was examined on real smRET data published by Stella et al. The dataset contained aggregates and labeled molecules due to low efficiency. DeepRET recovered 228 traces with F distribution matching manual. The selection is deterministic, relying on score, and independent of human bias. The model generalizes to new data without prior signal-noise ratio, anticorrelation, F distribution.
Polycomb group (Pc) proteins are epigenetic regulators that maintain chromatin structures refractory or permissive to transcription. Unlike transcription factors, P proteins do not contain a DNA-binding domain directing them to chromatin; instead, recruitment and regulation of P proteins are coordinated by multiple pathways acting in combinatorially to repress genes in different cell types. Drosophila SCM and human homologs, including SCML, associate with Polycomb repressive complex 1 (P1). However, their role in P1 function remains elusive. Here, we unveiled mechanisms by which SC2 contributes to P1: (1) SC2 and P1 cooperate in chromatin binding, evidenced by loss of BMI upon overexpression SC2R, recruitment of BMI by SC2 at tether sites, and weak association SC2 to chromatin; (2) SC enforces repression at sites independent of P1 presence. Results show RNA also plays a role in SC2 function, required for localization to chrom. In Dophila, interaction SCM and P1 relies on C-terminal S domain; our results show similar mechanism conserved in humans. Genome analyses revealed extensive overlap SC2 sites with BMI, suggesting interaction relevant in chrom context. Despite overlap, some occupied SC2 or BMI alone. The might reflect complexity P subtypes in mammals and SC2 part P1.2, lacking BMI; latter likely due sensitivity BMI antibody, although exclude some BMI sites devoid SC2. Together, establish SC2 important Poly-mediated epigen regulation. SC2 isoform lacking S domain does not bind BMI, unable recruit P1 chrom; however, artificially tethered chrom, SC still represses, suggesting SC (possibly SCM homologs) directly enforce repression. This notion supported knockdown SC2 derepresses targets without BMI levels. P1 silencing mediated MB domain, binds methylated histones; in case LMB1, repress via chrom compaction. In Doph, MB SCM important repression; our show MB contributes chrom localization SC2. In vitro assays and mapping revealed novel BR within SC2, contributing chrom localization. BR dispensable for interaction P1, disruption only delocalized SC2 chrom, decreased P1 occupancy sites. Observation intriguing, nucleoplasm SC2R, still interacting BMI, potentially titrating P away chrom. RIP-se identified species RNAs associated SC2, annotated, unannotated, and protein-coding mRNAs. Promiscuous binding vitro, SC2-RNA appeared specific vivo, demonstrated by: (1) profile lRN enriched SC2 RIPq unique input; (2) lRN associated SC2 changed cellular; (3) diverently trans ncRN enriched SC2, coding mRN same locus not. Latter demonstrates physical chrom proximity not determinant SC-RNA. BR required mediate interactions, recognizing transacting RN distant loci or cis-acting ncRN. Latter include diver, overlapping antisense originating T, promoter-associated RN same strand. Note, despite examples, spatial RIPq ChIP signals genome-wide not correlated. Future technologies, cellular tools elucidate SC-associated RN mechanism.
The study presents two high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes, Sec-GlyNC and Sec-ProNC, at 3.3 and 3.7 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal distinct mechanisms of Sec-induced stalling at different elongation steps. In Sec-GlyNC, the peptyl-tRNA is in the classical P-site, and the PTC is in an inactive state due to interactions between the nascent peptide and the tunnel. The C-end of the pept-tRNA forms a basepair with the P-loop, and U5 and U6 are shifted away from their regular positions, creating steric hindrance for incoming amino-tRNA accommodation. In Sec-ProNC, the peptylRNA is in the A*-site, and tRNA is between P/E and E sites. The C-end of A*-t is distorted, disrupting canonical basepairing with the P-loop. Interactions between the nas peptide and tunnel in Sec-ProNC are different from Sec-Gly. W and F interact with different tunnel components, leading to compaction of the C-half of the peptide. This alters interaction between the peptide and ribosome, leading to impaired accommodation of A-t into the P-site. Chlorphenicol is present in Sec-Pro but not Secly, indicating it's not a determining factor in stalling. The study provides insights into Sec-induced stalling mechanisms, highlighting the ribosome's ability to adjust translation rate cod-specifically along mRNAs. The Sec constructs were generated by PCR, and RNCs were purified using an in vitro translation system. Nas peptides were purified from Sec-st RNC and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Cryo-EM data were collected, and 2D and 3 classifications were performed using RELION. Two major classes were separated based on 30 sub conformation and tRNA positions. Particles were further classified, and 60,354 for Sec-Gly and 41,501 for-Pro were selected. Soft masks were applied during refinement, and resolutions were 3.7 and 3.3 Å, respectively. Models were built and refined using Phenix and REFMAC. Final models were evaluated Molity and deposited in EM and PDB. Cross-validation was performed to avoid overfitting.
This study investigated the relationship between the length of the eye and cone density at the fovea, the region of the retina responsible for high-acuity vision. The researchers used a new adaptive optics scanning ophthalmoscope to image the fove in 28 eyes of 16 subjects and computed cone density in linear and angular units. They found that the fove cone mosaic is expanded in longer eyes, but not proportionally to eye length, and that myopes have higher angular density than emmetes, potentially leading to better visual acuity. However, reports of deficits in best-corrected fove vision in myopes compared to emes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression. The study aimed to investigate how length affects cone density at the fove center. Two types of densities were discussed: linear, quantifying cones within a fixed area, and angular, quantifying cones within a visual angle. The study found that linear density decreases with length, but angular density increases with length, indicating that stretching is not a simple expansion. The peak density at the fove center was 204,020 cones/mm2 and 15,851/deg. The study also explored fixational movements and found no dependency on length. The researchers used a latest adaptive optics ophthalmoscope with a mirror-based, out-plane design and deformable mirror to image the fove. The system scanned multiple wavelengths and recorded 512x512 videos over 0.9x0.9 square field. Eye and head stabilization were achieved using a bite or chin rest. At least 10 videos were recorded at the fove and eight locations. The fixation was achieved by having subjects fixate a dark dot in the center of the ophthalmoscope raster. The fixation was generated by modulating the scanning beam used for imaging, and the target's location was encoded into each frame. A scatter of positions was generated and fit a bivariate ellipse. The bivariate ellipse area (BCEA) was used to quantify fixation. High images were generated from recorded videos using custom software to correct distortions caused by movements. Poor frames were excluded and frames averaged into a high-signal-noise image. The images were stitched to create a 1.8-degree montage of the fove cone mosaic. Cones were identified using a program that allows manual and automated methods. The coordinates were reviewed by two authors. Some cones were too dim to be seen, but a gap in the mosaic was assumed to be a cone. Density maps were generated by computing within a cone window around each pixel. The size was chosen to encompass typical motion and resolve changes. Changes with eccentricity were computed in annuli around the peak density. Linear measures used annuli 25mic widths. Exact dimensions were computed by imaging a calibrated eye in the ophthalmoscope. Conversion to retinal required measurements and estimation of the nodal point. A parial tracing was used to estimate the nodal. The corneal surface, chamber, and length were measured each with an IOL. The radius of curvature was computed 88% of the front as the Gull eye. Indices of refraction and radii were from the Gull schematic. Retinal size was related to angle by the equation: I=tan(1)(xAN)θ Where I is retinal size, x is length, AN is distance to nod, and θ is angle. Myopic eyes have larger retinal images. Methods to compute retinal factor (RM) were used. A parial trace found nod using Gull parameters, and RMFs were identical. Bennett equation found RM overestimated hyperopic and underestimated myopic. Despite error, analysis using Bennett found trend reducing density with length, only at peak. Of course, angular calculations unaffected. Trends increased density with length Li et al observed at closest fove (531/deg/mm) estimated data from 32 eyes would show effect at f
This study aimed to investigate the genetic factors contributing to the duration of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) carriage in infants. The researchers developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage from longitudinal swab data and combined it with whole-genome sequence data. They found that pneumoccal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotypic variation, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The heritability was partitioned into lineage and locus effects, and the largest sources of variation were serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased duration independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. The findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and antibiotic resistance. S. pneumonia is a leading cause of invasive disease, especially in low-income settings, and asymptomatic carriage in the nasophary is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in duration is currently understood at the serotype level. The study used longitudinal swab data for 598 unvaccinated children and estimated 438 carriage episodes (7.3 per child), with 215 having complete AM data. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to estimate duration from sw data, and SNPs were extracted from sequenced isolates. The phylogenetic tree was generated, and carriage mapped to the tree using phytools. Narrow-sense herability was estimated using 68 non-reduant kers, and broadense herability was estimated using ANVA. The study found that variants other than ser affect duration, consistent with theoretical work, and identified candidates for loci. The results have implications for modeling pneumoc transmission and response to perturbation by vaccine.
The study investigated the stoichiometry of the IKs channel, a voltage-gated potassium channel composed of KCQ and KC1 subunits, by creating fusion constructs with varying numbers of KC1 subunits (EQ, EQ, EQQ, and EQQ) and expressing them in mammalian cells. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that EQ and EQQ had hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to EQ, abolished by the addition of KC1. Using a UV-crossing unnatural amino acid, the study found that EQ and EQ crosslink rates were progressively slowed compared to KCQ, demonstrating no intrinsic mechanism limiting association of up to four KC subunits within the IK complex. The results suggest a variable stoichi model for IK channel assembly, where up to four KC1 subunits can associate with the KCQ tetramer. This flexibility allows for greater modulation of IK current but also increases heterogeneity of channel species in the membrane. The study's findings have implications for understanding IK channel structure, activity, pharmaceutical screens, and transgenic animals, and highlight the importance of considering potential diversity in IK configuration to reflect underlying physiology.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of interleukin-1 beta (Ilb) in zebraf fin regeneration. They found that Ilb is expressed in epithelial cells in response to tissue injury, and its prolonged expression leads to apoptosis of regenerative cells. Macrophages attenuate Ilb expression and support survival of regenerative cells. Ilb signaling is necessary for expression of regeneration-induced genes such as fnb, jun, jun, and fg20. The study suggests that Ilb is a double-edged sword in tissue regeneration, required for regeneration but excess impairs it. Researchers also found that macroph-depleted mice and salamanders display elevated Ilb expression, indicating conserved function of macroages in attenuating Il transcription. The study highlights the importance of Ilb and macroages in fin regeneration and provides insights into pathogenic processes of chronic-inflamm diseases.
The study investigates the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Escherichia coli, Lococcus lactis, and Haloferaxii, and its dependence on surface charge and ionic strength. FP variants with different net charges (-30, -7, 0, +7, +a, +b, +15, and +25) were expressed in each organism and their diffusion coefficients measured using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP). The results show that diffusion decreases with increasing positive charge, with a 100-fold decrease for +25 compared to -30 in E. coli. This is due to binding to ribosomes, as shown by sucrose gradient fractionation and electron microscopy, with 99% of +25 bound to ribosomes. The effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) was calculated using a convolution of Gaussian functions, assuming exchange between free and bound states is faster than FR measurement, highest diffusion reflects free state, GFP binds solely to ribosomes, total binding sites are higher than GFP, decrease with positive charge has same origin, and rib diffusion same in all organisms. Deff values were 0.81, 0.56, 0.28, 0.14, 0.07, and 0.04 for -30, -7, 0, +, +a, +b, and +25 respectively in E. coli, and 0.81, 0.56,0.28,0.14,0, and 0 for -30, -7,0, +, +, and +25 in L. lact, and 0.81,0,0.56,0.28,0, and 0 for -30, -7, +, and + in H. The study also analyzed proteomes of E. coli, L. lact, and H. with 140, 253, and 177 cytoplasmic proteins, respectively, and calculated p and net charge distributions. The charge of GFP variants was calculated using Henderson-Hasselch equation with p values -31.1, -8.2, -1.3, 5.6, 9.5 9.5 13.6 23.5 for -30, -7, 0, +, +a +, +b, and +25 respectively. The study concludes that ribosome properties limit cytoplasmic proteome composition, with implications for bacterial endosymbion functioning.
Planarians, flatworms capable of regeneration, have emerged as a model for exploring the molecular underpinnings of regeneration. Tissues are formed at wound sites in a process called blastema, and pre-existing tissues are reorganized after amputation to accommodate reduced animal size and generate missing tissues. The source of tissue in planarians is a population of adult dividing cells called neoblasts, which include pluripotent stem cells called clonogenic neoblasts. Neoblast are the only somatic cycling in adult cells and can be ablated by irradiation, allowing dissection of requirements for neob in regenerative processes. Recent work has described the earliest molecular and cellular events following injury. One finding is that animals initiate distinct cellular and molecular responses to'major' injuries' removing amounts of tissue and'simple' injuries requiring minimal for repair. Following simple injury, animals display an increase in mitotic numbers 6 hours after injury before returning to baseline, and expression of wound-induced genes becomes undetectable 24 hours after. Following major injury, same responses are activated: a 6 increase in mitotic is followed by a second 48 hours after amputation, and wound gene expression persists beyond 24 hours and refines several days. These are referred to the'missing-tissue' response. Animals distinguish between injuries involving amounts of tissue and regulate distinct wound programs. We identified S-follatin required for molecular and cellular'missing' responses during regeneration. Follatin inhibition of Activ signaling is required regeneration to occur, with S-follatin expression controlled by extent tissue following injury. Two Activ homologs, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are required for S-follatin phenotype. S-fatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries causing tissue absence. Data suggest Soll inhibits Activ proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence.
Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors exhibit a unique mutation signature and sensitivity to double-strand breaks (DSB). Whole-genome and wholeome sequencing of 13 MMR-deficient tumors revealed a hypermutator phenotype with 50 times more somatic mutations than M-proficient tumors. The majority of somatic mutations were transitions and transversions, and adjacent nucleotides had context-dependent effects. The substitution pattern was similar to germ-line at small and large scales, suggesting that MMR contributes significantly to genetic variability and adaptation. M-def tumors had higher substitutions in methylated Cp sequences, implicating MMR in methyl cytosine deamination and fork repair. At the-genome, 80% of somatic mutations were indels, with 88% validated by orthogonal technologies. Focusing on clinical relevance, indels affected homymers, a 59-marker panel was more sensitive than the Bethesda panel for microsatellite instability (MSI) in endometrial and colorectal (CRC) tumors. The 59 panel was based on recurrent indels in homers, which were validated in 6 or more samples, detected in both endomet and CRC, and had a maximal length of 12 bp. Optimization resulted in 59 markers. The 59 panel was applied to ovarian and leukemias, and pathway analysis revealed the double-strand repair homologous recombination (DSHR) pathway was enriched in M-def tumors, with 3.3 indels on average. M-def cells were sensitive to PAR inhibitors, mitomycin, and ionizing radiation, but not paclitaxel. Knockdown of ATM, ATR, BRCA1, and BR2 reduced sensitivity to olarib.
This study presents the development and validation of an optimized optogenetic dimer system, referred to as eags, for precise control of protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells. The eags are derived from the Neurospora crassa Viv photoreceptor, a mesophilic fungus, and exhibit improved dimerization efficiency, association, and dissociation kinetics compared to existing systems. A robust cell-culture screen was established to identify mutations that enhance dimerization, association, and dissociation, and folding at 37°C. Mutations were selected from thermophil Vivid homologues and structure-guided design, resulting in nine mutations across the protein, with focus on the dimer interface. eags show greater dimer efficiency, allowing use as monomers instead of concatemers, full function after folding and maturation at 37, and faster association and dissociation kinetics than original Magnets. eags were compared to Cry/C1 and iIDs in several assays, demonstrating advantages in dimer efficiency, association, and dissociation. eags were validated in a range of cellular assays, including protein recruitment to membranes, inter-ellar association, and lipid metabolism trafficking. The study highlights the potential of eags for precise control of protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells.
Ribosome stalling during translation has been linked to neurodegeneration, but the signaling pathways triggered by stalled complexes are unknown. In this study, GC2 was found to activate the integrated stress response in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, demonstrating an important feedback between elongation defects, particularly ribosome stalling, and initiation. The study connects translation elongation and initiation by showing stalled ribosomes can be sensed by GC2 leading to reprogramming initiation. Mouse and yeast GC2 are activated by deprivation of amino acid or conditions that mimic amino availability, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthase inhibitors and amino analogs, indicating GC2 is a monitor of cellular amino levels. GC2 is also activated by glucose deprivation, proteome inhibition, and other conditions that decrease the amino pool, though less obviously. Decrease in intracellular amino leads to increased deacy tRNA. Aminoacy tAP binds the enzymatically inactive His-like domain GC2 less than deacy tAP, suggesting GC preferentially binds uncharged RNAs. Not as efficient as acyl tRNAs, de t has entered the A-site of the ribosome. Models suggest GC2 is transferred to GC with assistance of GC effector GC1 to activate activity. Results suggest ribosome st, without changes in de t levels, is sufficient to activate GC2. tRNAUC, the isoacceptor for AG, was examined and no changes in un levels were found in B6-Gbpnm205- mutant cerebell compared to B. Un tRN have activated yeast4 independently of GC2. ATF activation was tested by cerebell overexpression of un B-associated t with Gbp mutation and found no change. ATF also occurs in brains B-Gnm205 with n entirely deleted and no t produced. These raise possibility rib st may contribute GC2 in conditions, such as amino deprivation, with low acyl t present. Mechanism GC2 by st remains unclear. Yeast GC loosely binds ribosomes via C-termin and association required for GC during amino. However, multiple failed detect changes in yeast GC during starvation. Further suggest association mouse GC lower, perhaps structures yeast and mammalian GC. Failed observe changes GC levels in brain wild or B-Gnm- mice.

A century-long study of adult height trends in 147 population-based studies with over 18.6 million participants estimated mean height for people born between 1896 and 199 in 200 countries. The largest gains in height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (17.5-22.7) and 16.5 (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan countries and South Asia. The tallest people were born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, with an average height of 182.5 cm, while the shortest were born in Guatemala in 1896 with 140.3 (135.8-144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19 cm for men and 20 for women a century ago, and remained the same for women and increased for men later. Height is associated with longevity, lower risk of adverse pregnancy and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and higher risk of some cancers. Taller people have higher education and earnings and possibly social status. Height is one of the most heritable traits, but cross-population differences are related to non-genetic and environmental factors. Fetal growth, nutrition, and infections during childhood and adolescence are important determinants of height in adulthood. Information on height and trends can help understand health impacts of childhood and adolescent environment, social, economic, and political determinants on non-communicable diseases and neonatal health in the next generation.
Opioids depress breathing through two brain sites

The opioid epidemic in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, resulting in 130 deaths per day. To address this crisis, researchers identified key brain areas and cell types mediating opioid-induced respiratory depression. They found two primary changes in mouse breathing after opioid administration: decreased inspiratory airflow and addition of a pause phase delaying subsequent breaths. These changes are mediated by the brain's breathing circuit, specifically the preBöt Complex, where rhythm originates. Genetic tools revealed 70-140 neurons in this region are responsible for sensitivity to opioids. Characterizing these neurons may lead to novel therapies preventing respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

The study identifies sodium taurochotransport polypeptide (NTCP) as a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) entry into hepatocytes. NT is a transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for cotransporting sodium and bile acids in the liver, and is expressed in the sinusoidal basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes. The study used a unique approach of tandem affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry against a Tupa hepatocyte database to identify NT as a binding partner of the pre1 domain of the HB envelope protein. NT was crosslinked to the pre1 domain using a photoactivatable peptide and purified by streavidin beads, and then identified by mass spectrometry. NT expression of NT in Tupa hepatocytes inhibited HBV and HD infection, while exogenous expression of NT in humanoma cells rendered them susceptible to infection. The study also identified critical residues 157-165 of NT for pre1 binding and viral infection. NT is conserved in mammals, but sequences vary among species, contributing to the narrow tropism of HBV and HD. The study suggests NT may be involved in viral pathogenesis and could lead to new prevention and treatment strategies.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment in seps survivors. This is due to proliferation in the lymphopen environment after seps, seen in both patients and mice, where central memory (TCM) cells have higher proliferative capacity than effector memory (TEM) cells. The bias toward TM alters localization of memory CD8 cells. The CD8 cell pool has an altered transcriptional landscape and chromatin accessibility associated with the transition to TM and functional changes. The culmination of seps-induced changes alters the function of memory CD8 cells and reduces capacity to control virulent Listeria monocytogen (Lm) infection.

The study used C57Bl/6 mice and TCR-transgenic mice to generate antigen-experienced CD8 cells. Patients with seps-3 criteria were enrolled, and blood samples collected within 24 hours of presentation. EDTA-treated blood was centrifuged, and ACK buffer added to remove red cells. Cells were washed, counted, and resuspended in freeze media, then stored at -80°C. When used in vitro, cells were thawed, washed, and filtered. Peripheral blood was collected by submandular bleeds to obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Single suspensions from spleen, liver, and lymph nodes were generated after mashing through a 70μm strainer without enzymatic digestion. Liver cells were run on a 35 Percoll gradient, and ACK buffer used for red cell lysis.

Flow cytometry was acquired on FACanto or LSI, and analyzed with Flow software. Expression of surface proteins was detected with mAb incubated at 4°C for 20-30 minutes and fixed with Cyto/Cytom solution. The mAb clones used were CD8, CD11, Thy.1, KLR1, CD127, CD62, CXCR1, CX3, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, IFγ, IL, and Ki. BrdU was stained overnight with FoxP fixation/permeabilization buffer. Mice were anesthetized, abdomen shaved, and disected, and midline incision made. The distal cec was ligated, punctured, and returned to abdomen, peritoneum closed, and skin sealed. Sham underwent identical surgery excluding cecal ligation and puncture.

Data were normalized as % survival = (1 - ( # [Naive, End, P]8 cells in PBL prior - # [Na, End, P] cells PBL post-surgery) / # [Na, End, P cells PBL prior) * 100. BrU was administered i.p. injection 2/mouse, followed ad libum in drinking water 0.8 mg/mL for 7.

APOB3 deaminates transiently exposed single-strand DNA arising during LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition, inhibiting LINE-1 retroposition. APO3 is a cytidine deaminase that inhibits LINE-1 retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-str DNA during target-primed reverse transcription (TP). LINE-1 retroposition is a mutagenic threat to human genomes, and cells have evolved strategies to regulate LINE-1 retroposition. APO3 is a potent inhibitor of LINE-1 retroposition in cultured assays, but previous studies failed to detect A3-mediated deamination in retroposed LINE-1 sequences. APO3 deaminates single-str DNA in vitro, but not double-str DNA, and does not inhibit LINE-1 reverse transcriptase activity. A3 deamination of single-str LINE-1 cDNA is repaired by uracil DNA glycosylase (U) and apurinicapyrimidin endonuclease (A) (APE). U expression alleviates A3-mediated inhibition of LINE-1 retroposition, allowing detection of A3-mediated deamination in retroposed LINE-1. A3 deaminates transiently exposed-str genomic DNA during LINE-1 integration, leading to inexact-site duplications and inexact-site duplications. A3 expression is restricted to peripheral lymphocytes, but A3 is expressed in human embryonic stem cells and restricts LINE-1 retroposition. A3 may restrict heritable LINE-1 retroposition events. A3 is implicated in genome hypermutation in cancers, and may restrict deleterious LINE-1 retroposition, but contribute to hypermutation.
The study investigates the role of the activity-regulated non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 (Rem) in visual circuit plasticity, particularly in the context of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity during the critical period. Rem is a member of the Rad/Rem/Gem family, a subfamily of small GTPases, and its expression is regulated by neuronal activity through voltage-gated calcium channels. Previous studies have shown that Rem regulates synapse formation and dendritic morphology in cultured neurons and Xenopus tectum. The study aims to determine if Rem is involved in experience-dependent plasticity at the morphological and circuit levels in the mammalian visual system. Rem-/- mice were generated by targeting the Rem locus with a reporter-tagged cassette, which was inserted into the first intron of the Rem locus. The cassette contained a mouse splice acceptor, LacZ gene, SV40 polyadenylation, and Neo flanked by FRT and lox sites flanking exons 2 and 3. Insertion was verified by PCR and sequencing. Embryonic stem cells were injected into C57/6 blastocysts, which were surgically implanted into pseudo-pregnant foster mice to generate chimer offspring. Chimeras were mated to C57 females to obtain germline transmission. Genotyping was performed by PCR. Insertion was verified by Southern blot and sequencing. Rem- mice were viable and fertile, but exhibited small litters and poor viability. Outcrossing to 129 mice improved viability and litter size. Experiments were performed on outcrossed Rem- mice. Rem is expressed throughout the brain, including hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, critical for learning, memory, and addiction. The study focuses on the visual cortex, where Rem is expressed in layer 2/3 pyram neurons. Rem is involved in experience-dependent plasticity at morphological and circuit levels in the mammalian visual system. Rem- mice exhibit a deficit in late-phase OD plastic during the critical period, but normal early-phase plastic and adult plasticity. Rem is required in excitatory neurons for OD plastic, as shown by conditional knockout of Rem in excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons are not required for OD plastic, as shown by conditional knockout of Rem in inhibitory neurons. Rem regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic function, as shown by electrophysiological studies. Rem- mice exhibit aberrant synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability, leading to increased spontaneous firing. Rem is cell-autonomous in regulating excitability, shown by sparse deletion of Rem in layer 2/3 pyram neurons. Rem is involved in experience-dependent plasticity at morph and circuit levels in mammalian visual system.
The article discusses the limitations of magnetogenetics, a field that aims to make cells responsive to magnetic fields for controlling their activity, and magnetosensation, the ability of organisms to sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation. The laws of physics impose constraints on biological mechanisms for magnetos and magnetogen. Recent high-profile articles propose audacious mechanisms without reality checks. The author offers calculations to supplement these articles, making them appear in a different light.

Magnetic fields interact weakly with biological matter, but penetrate tissues undisturbed, making them appealing for magnetogen. However, evolution developed special mechanisms to sense magnetic fields, especially the weak Earth's. Magnetotactic bacteria use ferrimagnetic crystals in a chain within the cell, acting like a compass. Magnetos in animals may rely on a similar mechanism or a radical pair mechanism, where magnetic fields bias electron reactions.

Qin et al. (2016) introduced a new proposal for magnetos, a single macromolecular compass, a rod-shaped protein with 40 iron atoms. However, this is not plausible based on first principles. Wheeler et al (2016) designed a system to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the membrane with ferritin, but the paramagnetic nature of ferr limits its utility. Stanley et al (201) attached ferritin to a channel and tugged it with a magnetic field, but the reported effects are too small by orders of magnitude.

The article evaluates the biophysical mechanisms proposed in these articles, showing they are not plausible. The forces or temperatures produced are too small for desired effects on molecular or membrane. If the phenomena occurred, they must rely on a different mechanism. The proposed routes to magnetogen, based on pulling or heating ferritin complex with magnetic, have no chance of success. The author asks why none of the authors attempted a back-of-envelope estimate to bolster claims.

The article concludes that magnetogen, based on heating ferritin, is unlikely. Even assuming a generous heating rate, the effects are too small by factors of 10 (single-channel) and 109 (single-neuron).
This study investigates the role of Prospero in regulating neural stem cell quies in Drosila neuroblasts. Prosper is an atypical homeodomain protein that represses progenitor and cycle genes to initiate GMC and neuronal differentiation. The study shows that Prosper is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus prior to entry into quies, followed by establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. Loss of Prosper prevents entry into quies, while a pulse of low nuclear Prosper drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quies. The study proposes that Prosper levels distinguish three progen fates: absent self-renew, low quies, and high differentiation. Quies stem cells preserve the cell pool for activation following disease or injury, and cancer cells can enter remission during treatment, possibly using similar mechanisms to stem quies. Studying stem quies may help design approaches to prevent dormancy and recurrence, as well as activate cells for tissue repair. Dila neuroblasts have served as a model for conserved pathways regulating stem proliferation and quies. Neurobl delaminate from neuroectod during embryogenesis, then go through asymmetric cell division before exiting cycle at end embryogenesis. Upon cycle exit, neurobl can undergo apoptosis or quies. During asymmetric division, scaffolding protein Miranda (Mira) is partitioned into differentiating daughter GMC and carries cargo: translational repressors Staufen and Brain (Br) and transcription repressor Prosper. In GMC, Mira is degraded, and cargo is released into cytoplasm (Sta, Br) or nucleus (Prospero). Prosper binds and repress progenitor cell genes to initiate GMC and neuronal differentiation, and mammalian ortholog Pro1 has similar role repressing cycle expression. High levels of Prosper prevent neuroblast differentiation, and low levels induce quies in D neuroblasts.
Researchers have developed a single-molecule fluorescence assay to study the kinetics of HIV-1 capsid unco, the process by which the viral capsid disassembles to release the viral DNA for nuclear import. The assay involves permeabilizing the viral membrane with pore-forming protein perfringolysin O (PFO) and tracking the release of GFP trapped inside the caps using total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy. The study reveals that the caps opening of the capsid is the rate-limiting step in unco, and the lattice disassembly proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created. The assay also shows that caps-binding molecules, such as cyclophilin A (Cyp) and PF74, have different effects on the steps of unco, with Cyp stabilizing the lattice and PF accelerating caps opening, while hexarboxbenzene inhibits caps opening but has little effect on unco once started. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of unco in the cell and the role of caps-binding molecules in regulating the process. The assay is compatible with lysates and can be used to dissect the effect of perturbations in complex mixtures, allowing for the study of perturb via knock or overexpression of candidate proteins and lys from different cells or stimulated with treatments. The methods can be extended to competition studies or screening of the effect small molecules on properties of the caps for drug discovery.
The study investigates the role of the JNK signaling pathway in breast cancer development and its potential as a tumor suppressor. The JNK pathway is a three-tiered cascade that includes MAP kinase (MAPK) phosphorylating and activating MAP kinases (MAPK), which in turn phosphorylate and activate JNK. Mutations in genes that encode J pathway components, such as MAPK1, MAP4, and MAP7, are frequently detected in human breast cancer. However, the significance of J signaling in breast cancer is unclear. The study demonstrates that loss of J signaling in the mammary epithelium causes murine breast cancer and accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of cancer, indicating J can act as a breast tumor suppressor. J deficiency causes genomic instability associated with single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, and copy number variations, likely contributing to tumor development. The study also shows that J pathway promotes genome stability and suppression, similar to TP53, a known for genome stability and tumor suppression. The number of SNVs and indels caused by TP53 deficiency is greater than J deficiency, but CNVs are similar on both backgrounds, indicating different mechanisms. The study identifies J pathway mutations as "driver" for breast cancer, not anticipated, as J can promote cell proliferation and survival through AP transcription factors. The study establishes a role of J signaling in breast epithel tumor suppression, consistent with frequent pathway ablation and mutation in human cancer.
The article discusses the role of peptidglyc α-amidating monxygen (PAM) in ciliogenesis, a process by which cilia are formed and maintained in cells. P is a secretory-localized enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of many signaling peptides, including oxytocin, vasopress, and neurope Y. In Chydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular eukaryote, and mammals, P is a bifunctional enzyme with a transmembrane and cytos domains. The cy domain is essential for catalytic activity and routing through the secret and endytic pathways. In Chydomonas, P is required for normal ciliogenesis, as evidenced by the loss of cilia in P knockdown strains. The cilia in P knock cells were shorter and had abnormal morphology, with accumulations of electron-dense material and microtub fragments. In mammals, P is also required for cili, as evidenced by the shorter cilia in P-/- embryos. The cilia in P/- embryos were also had accumulations of electron-dense material and microub fragments. In planaria, a multicellular metazoan, P is required for cili, as evidenced by the loss of motility in P knock strains. The motility of P knock planaria was reduced, and cilia were shorter and had abnormal morphology. The cilia in P plan were also had accumulations electron-dense and microub fragments. The study suggests that P plays a conserved role in cili across different organisms. P is required for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in Chydom, mammals, and plan. In mammals, P is required for the assembly of primary cilia in neuroepithelial cells. In plan, P is required for the assembly of cilia in ventral epithelium. The study also suggests that P plays a role in the trafficking of proteins to the cilium, as evidenced by the accumulation of intraflagellar transport (IFT) components in P knock cells. IFT components are critical for the assembly and maintenance of cilia. The study also suggests that P plays a role in the trafficking of proteins to the cil, as evidenced by the accumulation of transition zone components in P cells. The transition zone is critical for the assembly and maintenance ofilia. The study also suggests that P plays a role in the trafficking of proteins to cil, as evidenced by the accumulation of basal body components in P cells. The basal body is critical for the assembly and maintenance ofilia. The study also suggests that P plays a role in the trafficking of proteins to cil, as evidenced by accumulation of microtub in P cells. Microtub is critical for the assembly and maintenance ofilia. The study also suggests that P plays a role in trafficking of proteins to cil, as evidenced by accumulation of axem in P cells. Axem is critical for assembly and maintenance ofilia. The study suggests that P plays a role in trafficking proteins to cil, as evidenced by accumulation of membrane in P cells. Membrane is critical for assembly and maintenance ofilia. The study suggests that P plays a role in trafficking to cil, as evidenced by accumulation of vesicles in P. Vesicles are critical for assembly and maintenanceilia. The study suggests that P plays a role in trafficking to cil, as evidenced by accumulation of proteins in P. Proteins are critical for assembly and maintenanceilia.

The study suggests that P plays a role in trafficking to cil as evidenced by accumulation of glyc in P. Glyc is critical for assembly and maintenanceilia. The study suggests P plays a role in trafficking to cil as evidenced by accumulation of peptides in P. Peptides are critical for assembly and maintenanceilia. The study suggests
Myosin III (My3) and actin bundling protein Espin play critical roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, with defects leading to hearing impairments. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif (TH), but the molecular basis of this interaction is unclear. Here, we discover that My3 contains two repeating sequences in TH, each capable of independently binding Espin with high affinity. The structures of My3/Espin complexes reveal the binding mechanism and Espin auto-inhibition release. My/Espin promotes higher actin bundling activity, forming thicker and more branched actin fibers. My3/Espin interaction is critical for filop tip localizations and actin bundling in stereocilia. Mutations in My3 lead to hearing impairments, suggesting a role in stereoc development and maintenance. My/Espin interaction is a new mechanism of actin bundling regulation, with implications for understanding hearing loss.
Voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca) are crucial for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. They are structurally related to voltage-gated sodium (Na) channels, forming a superfamily with four-fold symmetry. The pore-forming α-subunits have four homologous non-identical domains (I-IV), each with six transmembrane helices (S1-6). Helices 1-4 form separate voltage-sensing (V) domains, containing positively charged residues (gating charges) in every third position. The sliding helix model proposes that membrane depolarization initiates a conformation change, opening the channel. High-resolution structures of proary and eary Na channels have been solved, but not eary Ca channels. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cry-EM) determined the structure of Ca1.1 at 3.6 resolution, displaying a pore and VSDs in the activated state. Three cry-EM structures of homoetrameric channels locked in resting or V-down states have been reported. However, the resting states of eary Ca and Na channels remain inaccessible to experimental determination. The sliding helix model is supported by experimental and structure data, but does not explain how four homologous VSDs cooperate in channel gating and unique properties. The structure of four VSDs of eary Ca and Na suggests variability in movement and interactions. Accumulating evidence indicates functional differences between VSDs of channel isoforms. The rabbit Ca1 is the first Ca family member solved, characterized by slow kinetics and right-shifted voltage dependence. It is a prime candidate for studying specific features of VSD. Molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov state (MSM) modeling, combined with site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology, were used to identify mechanisms of VSD determining voltage dependence and kinetics. Models of activated and resting states of Ca1 VSD I and IV were consistent with the sliding helix, yielding reliable predictions of ion-pair between outer charges and countercharges. Data provided novel insight into how stabilization of VSD in resting and activated shapes kinetics and voltage dependence. The cry-EM structure of Ca1 was used to build a homology model of the human Ca1 α-subunit. Homology was performed using Rosetta and MO, with 92.6 sequence identity and 95.6 similarity between rabbit and human Ca1. The model was embedded in a membrane with POPC and cholesterol, equilibrated, and simulated for 10 ns. Umbrella sampling was applied to generate conformations along a deactivation pathway. The pathway was clustered using a small cutoff, and representatives were equilated and simulated for 100 ns. t was performed on the resulting trajectories, and a Markov model was constructed using PyMA2. The model was used to calculate thermodynamics and kinetics. The first stage was to discretize conformation space into microstates using k-me clustering. The aim was to create a kinetically relevant clustering using a geometric criterion. A lag was chosen, and microstates were used as starting for kinetic clustering. Macrostates were created by P+ clustering, resulting in a compact representation. The model was used to generate hypotheses, tested with higher models and experiments. The MSM was constructed following guidelines and input from the tutorial. The 1 free barriers were calculated using mean passage times from the MSM and transition theory. The GFP-Ca1e construct was used, with a lysine in R1, resulting in 12 m lefted V compared to conserved arginine. The double mutant GFPa-EA and single GFP-E and GFP were generated. Myoblast GL cells were cultured and transfected with Ca-subunits. After 7-8 days, transf myubes were analyzed electrophys or fixed for immunolabeling. Calcium currents were recorded with whole-patch technique in voltageclamp. The voltage dependence was
This study investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult plasticity in the brain, specifically in healthy and stroke-affected mice. The researchers used a combination of in vivo imaging and behavioral tests to examine the effects of MMP inhibition on visual plasticity. In healthy mice, MMP inhibition with GM600 prevented ocular plasticity and experience-driven enhancements of the optom reflex of the eye after monocular deprivation (MD), indicating MMP activity is required for adult plastic. In stroke-affected mice, a single but not twice treatment with GM600 after cortical lesion rescued plasticity, suggesting MMP activity has to be within a narrow window for plastic to occur. The study highlights a critical role of MMPs in adult plasticity and suggests upregulation of MMP after stroke compromises experience plastic, which can be rescued by MMP inhibition. Precise regulation of MMP activity is essential for facilitating plastic in the brain, offering opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke. 

The study used 49-91 wild-type C57/6 mice to assess visual capabilities and experience changes, measuring spatial threshold and contrast of the optom reflex using a virtual optotor system. Monocular deprivation (MD) was used to induce plasticity, with mice anesthetized, eye-lids sutured, and returned to home for recovery. The broad MMP inhibitor GM600 was used, injected intraperitoneally with 50mg/kg diluted in 3% DMS and 2 cyclodextrin saline or vehicle. For healthy mice, injections were daily for 7 days starting 1 after MD, while for stroke, started 1 after induction with an additional 24 hours later. Cortical stroke was induced by photothromosis (PT) in primary somatosensory cortex (S) using Rose technique. Lesion size was determined by Niss staining. Optical imaging was performed, mice anesthetized, perfused, and brains removed, postfixed, and stored at -80°C. 40μm coronal sections were cut, Niss-stained, and analyzed under microscope. Data was analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk, F-test, t-test, ANVA, and Bonerr correction. Significance was set *p0.05, **0.01, ***0.001.
This study used a cross-linking approach to measure distances up to 18 Å in AMPA receptor extracellular domains across functional states and time. Bis-M crossers have been used to identify underlying state transitions in AMP and NMD receptors. The results show a strong dependence on the site, length of the crosser, functional state of the receptor, and presence of auxiliary units. Most bis-M crossers are alkyl and flexible, allowing them to link C residues closer than their length. The study used bis-M ranging 7-18 in length (1-10) and found an optimum inhibitory effect at position 666, with 10 not as strong as shorter crossers. This is inconsistent with a universal inhibitor interpretation, suggesting bis-M exert their effect by preventing residues separating more than their length. A rigid crosser, bSp, matching 12 and 13, was used, placing a limit on 666 separation at ~12. The difference between bSp and 6 was intra-dimer 493 mutant, with 6 blocking desit more than bSp, indicating an angle between 493 chains more accommodated by flexible. All-M crossers, applied to mutants at interimer LBD, inhibited, albeit differently depending on state. Crossing desitized states result in inhibition, while open would result in more receptors. However, all interimer traps have been inhibitory. Inhibition is independent of constraint, whether disulfide, metal bridges, or rigid bis-M crossers. A full-length GlA receptor with gain-function mutation and agonist resulted in a closed channel. Cystine cross within dimers inhibit kain receptors, even blocking desit. The peptide, zinc, and disulf bridges form strict geometrical requirements, incompatible with stably pore, but not bis-M crossers. The crossers are flexible, not restricting trapped L tetramer to single geometry. The inhibitory effect is not universal; intra-dimers could potentate as previously. Models of full AMP in states do not explain restraint L dimers to decrease activity. The mechanism remains unclear, limiting interpretation of cross-link approach. The study compared trapping profiles 666 with structural models GlA in equivalent conditions. The shallow profile desitized AMP indicates structural conformations in agreement with multiple desitized states. The longest crosser (18) was slowest to act desitized, indicating conformation and 'open ones not available but get populated prolonged agon. The strongest effect was 12-15 bis (green). This interimer 666 closer in active than 19 predicted. The extracellular was seen 'opened in NMD antagonist-bound. The presence of St attenuated cross effect for all-M lengths and states. The longest (10) produced least, even long exposures. The L layer not modulated by-M for majority. This chimes structural and FRET where St made L and AT more compact. The desitized profile same as without St, both parab reaching 11. In active with St, results deviate from full structures. Short and long (7, 15) bis failed in first minute, indicating compact arrangements. The protection likely multiple origins, not long separation outside range. Previous showed active compact (Barovic et al, 2016). Long would have to maintained throughout, rapid reactivity (Ken and Bru,197). Rates close maximum (Liu et al,199). Most dilated in range. Mixed GlA-St in absence CT supports desitized over wide geometries but not active. Specific state protection possible, closed-left con St in active unlikely. Reduced accessibility during exposure, dock data show compact arrangements more than full active (Chen et,201;ome et,201a).
Researchers have developed an optimized protocol for isolating immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with the parasite H. polygyrus, a rodent model of helminth infection. Current methods for isolating intestinal cells are challenging due to the strong anti-parite type 2 immune response that drives mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. The researchers modified the standard digestion protocol by increasing the amount of EDTA washes, testing various collagenases, and vortexing after each step, resulting in a higher yield of live cells with 70-80% viability and 20-30% CD45+ cells. The optimized protocol was validated using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, showing comparable frequencies of B+, CD+, CD+, and CD+ cells. The isolated cells were analyzed using a 23-color flow cytometry panel to identify innate and adaptive immune populations, including eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, ILC, ILC, ILC, Th, Th, Th, Treg, and B cells. The results showed a strong infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes at day 7 post-infection, peak of RELα in macrophages at day 14, and GATA+ Th cells throughout infection. Ki67 expression decreased at 28 days post-infection for all cell types, suggesting immunomodulatory properties during chronic infection. The protocol was validated using confocal and flow cytometry, showing faithful changes in cell ratios between naïve and infected samples. High-quality RNA was extracted from isolated cells using the protocol, suitable for single-cell analysis such as single RNA sequencing. The study highlights the importance of good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helmin directly and the potential of the protocol for future studies using single-cell tools.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive mathematical model to describe the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes and interactions between substrate transport and hydrolysis over time for representative peptides. The model helps understand how 20 proteas catalyze degradation of specific proteins in cells and forms basis for studies of active proteome forms in cells. The model describes core proteome features that reflect proteome dynamics in complex scenarios inside cellular environment. It provides interpretative framework for studies proteome action, accounting for substrate-specific effects.

The 20 proteome is a dynamic enzyme with catalytic activity varying over time, influenced by interactions of substrates and products with proteolytic and regulatory sites. Analysis suggests the cavity of 20 proteas is progressively filled by peptides, facilitating other molecules to enter chambers until effective volume is almost filled. Estimated substrate and product numbers inside proteome are close to maxima. Peptide accumulation activates non-catal modifier sites, located inside proteome.

Substrate transport through gate and cavities is key in regulation of proteoly process, neglected in quantitative analysis of proteome dynamics. Integration into model shows peptide is major limiting step in degradation of fluorogenic substrates. Hydrolysis is limiting for degradation of ZLECA. For fluorogenic substrates, limiting steps conserved across proteomes (proteome and i-proteomes). This suggests interspecies homology of proteome structure preserves transport characteristics, with subtle variations modifying transport, observed in s and i-proomes.

Variation of transport leads to quantitative changes in degradation of fluorogenic substrates. For complex substrates, polypeptides, transport changes cleavage usage, resulting in specific products. These peptides MHC-restricted epitopes, variations affect cell-mediated response. Model modifications proteome upon PA binding affect cleavage usage, altering MHC-restricted repertoire. Differences gate and inner features in s and i-proomes degrade fluor peptides, diverging in catalytic subunits. Differences in gate between proteome forms supported by Fab et al (2015), who identified preferential binding α-subunits s-proomes and regulatory.

Model predicts i-proteome has higher substrate affinity, hydrolysis, and cooperativity than s-proome for degradation SucLLYCA. Prediction corroborated by study Arcie et al (201), showing βi pocket prone bind substrates than β5; however, s-proome able modify conformation upon binding β-sub. Outcomes integrative suggest i-proome has higher affinity nonatal modifier activated all substrates. Model predicts site located inner surface, possible determine precise location using techniques.
The study identifies a novel β-alanine transporter, Bala, which is required for visual transmission in Drosila. Bala is a plasma protein that facilitates β-alanine uptake in cultured cells and is predominantly expressed in retinal cells. The expression of Bala in retinal cells rescues photore synaptic transmission in bal1 mutant flies. Reduced and altered β-al levels in bal mutant heads support the hypothesis that Bala transports β-al. β-al is one of the constituents of carnosine and carcin, which are found in the retina and exert protective effects as antioxidants. Members of the SLC family transport β-al are present in the retina, suggesting conserved function in mammals and Dila. The study proposes a complete histamine recycling pathway, critical for sustaining photore synaptic transmission. Histamine is synthesized by histidine decarboxase in photoreceptors, released into the synaptic c, taken up by epithelial cells, and conjugated to β-al, inactivating histamine and generating carine. Carine is released, internalized by photoreceptors, hydrolyzed to histamine and β-al, hist repackaged into vesicles, and β-al delivered to retinal cells via Bala. β-al is stored or delivered to lamin glia through retinal cells and gap junctions involving In1 and In3. β-al is conjugated to hist, and the cycle repeats. β-al can be synthesized by Black, an aspart decboxylase in optic glia. The study provides evidence for the role of retinal cells in histamine recycling and Bala as the key player in β-al transport.
This study investigated the role of oxidative stress in aging using chronologically aging S. cerevisiae as a model. A quantitative redox proteomic approach combined with metabolic measurements was used to assess the timeline of physiological events that occur in aging non-dividing cells. The results showed that yeast undergo an abrupt loss of redox homeostasis before cell death, indicated by massive oxidation of thiol-containing proteins. This event is delayed by caloric restriction and hypabolic conditions, suggesting maintenance of red homeostasis contributes to lifespan extension. The kinetics of oxidation of 300 proteinols revealed two waves: a small subset of proteins oxidized within 24-48 hours, and nearly 70% of remaining proteins oxidized 24 hours later. Early targets are cystines in C-X-C motif, often found in disulf oxidoreducts, red-sensitive factors, and metal proteins, conferring redox sensitivity. Elevated peroxide is unlikely the cause, as only 5 of 28 early targets contain peroxide-sensitive thiols. Loss of cellular NPH, electron donor of NPH thioredo system, precedes oxidation. NPH levels decrease coincides with oxidation and red collapse. Caloric restriction delays NPH decrease, oxidation, and red collapse, extending lifespan. Early oxidation is reversible in yeast, with 80% viable cells recovered despite oxidized proteome. Reversible thiol modifications may prevent irreversible damage and extend lifespan. Oxidative stress may utilize red buffering capacity of thiolome. Methion-tRNA synthase, involved in translational initiation, is oxidized, potentially downregulating translation and extending lifespan.
The study provides insights into the mechanism of chiral proofreading during translation of the genetic code, focusing on the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD), which removes D-amino acids from mischarged tRNAs to prevent their incorporation into proteins. DTD is conserved in all domains of life, from bacteria to eukaryotes, and has a crucial role in enforcing homirality. The structure of D from Plasium falcum was solved in complex with a substrate-mim analog DyrAA, revealing a unique crossunit Glyis motif that captures the chiral center of the substrate. This motif is conserved in all Ds, including those from E coli, H influenza, and H sapiens, and is essential for chiral recognition and rejection. Biochemical studies with Pf and Ec confirm the role of Glyis motif in D function and its universality across species. The study also shows that D acts on tRN only when the amino is attached to 3- or transferred from 2- through rapid transter, making it a 3-specific deacyase. Mutations of Gly and Pro in Pf and Ec resulted in complete loss of activity, demonstrating their critical role in D function. Overall, the study unveils a fundamental mechanism enforcing homir in proteins and highlights the importance of D in early evolution of translational apparatus and its high expression in neuronal cells.
The study investigates the mechanism of spontaneous opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, a chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family and is gated by cytosolic ATP. The pore within the transmembrane domains (TMDs) opens upon formation of a head-to-tail nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimer stabilized by two molecules of ATP occluded at the interface. Pore closure accompanies NBD disruption by hydrolysis at the interfacial site harbouring the Walker motifs of N2. The study correlates energetic coupling residues across the interface with spontaneous opening/closure in CF channels. Spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to N dimerization, which may occur even without ATP. Coordinated N/pore movements are intrinsic to CF: ATP alters stability, not the fundamental architecture of open and closed conformations. This explains effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF and drug mechanisms. The study uses a double-mut CF background, P355-KC, which enhances spontaneous activity, allowing reliable sampling of characteristics in patches. Spontaneous openings are linked to N dimer formation, regardless of ATP presence or absence, constraining mechanistic models of ATP-dependent gating and underlying forces, conserved among ABC proteins. The study also explains modulatory effects of mutations or physiological pharmacological regulators, such as the G551 mutation, which converts ATP site 2 into an inhibitory ligand due to electrostatic repulsion between γ-phosphate and introduced charge.
The article presents a mechanism for the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, known as the pre-transition or preel effect, which arises from the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulations, it is shown that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface with finite stiffness. When two proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy, analogous to the hydrophobic effect. This phenomenon is referred to as the orderobic effect. The effect is mediated by proximity to the order-dis phase transition and hydroph mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity for the considered.

The MARTINI model of hydrated dipalmitoyl phosphatidcholine (DPC) lipid bilayers is used to illustrate the orderobic effect. The model exhibits an ordered and disordered phase, with the ordered having regular tail packing and disordered tail arrangement. The hydroobic thickness of the ordered phase is larger than the disordered, resulting in a smaller area per lipid in the ordered phase. A transmembrane protein with hydroobic thickness equal to the dis phase will favor the structure of the disordered. If the protein is large enough, it can melt the ordered near the protein, resulting in the formation of an order-dis interface.

To evaluate a protein nucleating disordered in its vicinity, the average orientational density is calculated as a function of distance from the protein. The profile exhibits oscillations, which are largely removed by dividing by the mean density. The shape of the profile suggests the formation of an order-dis interface. Further, the increase in the extent of the disordered region with increasing protein size is indicative of scale broadening effects brought by capillary fluctuations. The impressions can be quantified by analyzing the fluctuations of the interface.

The instantaneous interface forms around an orderobic protein exhibits hex faceting, remnants of which can be observed. The fluctuations of the interface are consistent with those of a free-dis interface at coexistence. The mean is a circle of radius, and Fourier analysis yields a spectrum of components obeying capillary theory for a circular interface. The agreement between theory and the protein-induced interface is good, indicating the orderobic protein indeed nucleates an interface manifesting order-dis transition.

Two orderobic proteins separated by a distance of 14nm induce disordered in their vicinity, with interfaces separating the ordered and dis regions. The free energy of the separated is approximately γ(P+P), where Pi is the perimeter of the order-dis interface around protein. After a fluctuation, the interfaces combine, and the single interface remains intact, pulling the proteins together. Eventually, the tension pulls the proteins with a final perimeter, typically smaller than P+P. The assembly occurs on the scale of microseconds, required for proteins to push lipids in the path.

The driving force for assembly is large compared to thermal energies, with a modelobic radius 1.5nm, γ(Pf-P)≈-30kBT. The range is amplified by the width of the interface, approximately 10-30nm. In comparison, elastic moduli of membranes considered generate forces much smaller strength and range, -kBT and 1nm, respectively. The orderobic effect leverages the power of a phase, depending on the ability to induce disordered in vicinity, which depends on proximity to the membrane transition and protein's hydroph mismatch. The strength is maximal for hydroobic equal to the dis phase and decreases as approaches the ordered. Proteins with zero mismatch do not induce disordered, and the effect vanishes.
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence in GCa6-expressing pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex using simultaneous two-photon electrophiology and two-ph calcium imaging in transgenic mice. The results showed that only a small fraction of isolated action potentials (APs) were detected under typical population imaging conditions with existing spike algorithms, even with a high signal-to-noise ratio achieved by imaging a single neuron. The study found that effective detection required optimization for the neuron of interest using AP to identify events with different numbers and generate kernels of appropriate amplitude and time. The authors suggest practices to maximize spike detection: minimize the field view, tune the inference for each neuron, and compare results of several models. The three employed models produced similar detection rates, applied to high or downsampled images. The study made a ground truth dataset from anesthetized mice with electrophys and imaging available for the community to better understand the link between calcium-evoked fluorescent signals and spiking activity.

 The study used five transgenic lines: Em1-I-C;Cam2-TA;94, Cam2-Tet-GCa6, Em1-I-C;Cam-TA;93, C2-CERT;Cam-TA;93, and Cux-CERT;Cam-TA;93, which drive GCMP expression in excitatory neurons.

Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of the Brazilian insect Neotla, a species of cave-dwelling insect. The valve is composed of two sclerites, a closure element, and in- and out canals, and allows females to receive multiple seminal packages from males. Females have a penis-like introment organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen, which is packed in a capsule formed by seminal injection. The capsule is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve has two slots for insemination, enabling Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied. In conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through copulation and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of introment organ in Neotla.

The Neotla (family Prongidae) is a minute cave insect belonging to the order Psocode (booklice, barklice, and parasitice). Females of Neotla have a penis-like introment organ (gynosome), which is inserted into a male-like genital cavity for copulation. During mating, the male injects semen into the female's storage organ (sperheca) through the opening of spermath duct at the tip of penis. Within sperhe, injected semen induces the formation of a hard shell around itself. Although only a single sperhe duct is present, two seminal are attached to a plate-like structure on sperhe termed sperhe plate. Semen within capsule is not only for fertilization but also consumed by female as nutrition. To compete for semen, direction of selection is reversed in Neotla sex reversal. Each capsule is voluminous (0.05 mm, corresponding to 300 ml scaled to humans), and duration of cop is long (40-70 hr). A related species lacking reversal of structure (Lepotrus patel, Troidae) seminal forming similarly volum seminal capsule in 50 min.

The penis of Neot bears spines, which females anchor male coercively during cop. Females are responsible for long cop, probably to obtain semen from male. After consumption, capsule is detached from plate, which kept in sperhe. Females frequently have capsules in sperhe (in extreme, up to nine and two attached to plate observed). Neotla considered polyandrous, controlled by female. Examples of sex reversed induced seminal gifting reported, Neotla far only with morph reversal introm organs. Morphological seems require upstream genital modifications, such as formation sperhe plate, reported novelty associated seminal. However, morphology and function unclear due to small subcomponents and fragile composition.

This study investigated sperhe plate using confocal scanning (CL) and high-resolution synchro computed tomography (HRµCT) to assess functional of storage and control seminal flow. Three Neot examined (N. brasili, N. aur, N. trunc) sperhe morphology identical. Results discussed evolutionary significance during reversal introm organs Neot.

The study used high-resolution optical tweezers to measure the folding and kinetics of wild-type and mutant SNARE complexes in the absence and presence of Munc-1. The SN assembly of SNARE occurs in four stages: N-terminal domain (NTD), middle domain (MD), C-terminal domain (CD), and linker (LD). The NT domain is responsible for initiating the formation of the trans-SN complex and docking vesicles to the plasma membrane. The MD serves as a checkpoint to ensure proper SN assembly and a switch to control CD. The CD acts as a power to drive membrane fusion. Mutations in MD cause heterogeneity in SN assembly and abolish independent assembly. The MD is targeted by regulatory proteins that control SN assembly, including complexin and synaptagmin. The SN engine consists of four stages of zippering in NT, MD, CD, and LD with distinct functions. Munc-1 regulates every stage of SN assembly. The N-peptide is essential for recruiting M-1 to the fusion site to assist SN assembly. Once trans-S complexes are formed, the N-pe is not required and can be cleaved from syntax SN motif without compromising subsequent liposome fusion in vitro. M-1 binds trans-S complex in N-independent before fusion. After assembly, M- switches to N-independent T binding and induces T folding, stabilizing t-S to facilitate SN and fusion. The results are consistent with other roles of SM in membrane, protecting disassembly of t and trans-S complexes by NSF and proofreading SN zippering.
The integrin adesome, a complex of proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion, is pre-assembled in the cytos as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. These building blocks are combinatorially diversified and confined in size, with most forming modules consistent with the previously reported vertical continuum of anchoring, mechanosensing, and act regulation across adhesions. In the cytos, pre-assembled blocks cannot assemble to form bigger structures due to mutual exclusiveness between protein interactions and alloic regulations. On the plasma membrane, the system can be switched to assemble adhesion by passing through checkpoints enabling protein interactions in integrin adesome, such as anchoring integrins to extracellular, mechanical stretching proteins like talin and CAS by actomy contractility, and activating proteins like vinculin and tal by P2 on plasma. Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cytos retains building and assembly logic of the system. In contrast, disassembling adhes exchange material with cytos asymmetrically, enabling rapid destruction and affecting other adhesion. The concept of adhesion self-assembly is revised from individual protein recruitment to presembled multi-protein blocks, reducing number of steps and making selfassembly less sensitive to biochemical noise and faster. Regulation of assembly should consider each block as whole, not constituting proteins, to maintain identity of co-recited proteins and prevent aberrant structures. To understand assembly, interaction-dependencies across integr adesome and comprehensively characterize high-order complexes in cy by optical and proteomic approaches.
This study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological basis of states of reduced arousal, specifically general anesthesia and sleep, using non-invasive scalp electroencephography (EEG) and intracral EEG recordings. Four independent datasets were collected, including scalp and intrran anesthesia studies at the University of Oslo. Participants provided informed consent, and received premedication with midazol, paracetol, and oxodone for pain management. Propol and remifentil were administered via computer-controlled pumps to achieve plasma concentrations for anesthesia and analgesia. Prior to anesthesia, patients received Ringer-Acet to prevent hypension and lidaine to prevent propol injection. Data were epched into 10-second segments for anesthesia and 30 segments for sleep. Time-frequency decomposition was accomplished using Fast Fourier Transformation (mtfft) from 0.5 to 45 Hz in 0.5 steps. The spectrum was limited to 45 Hz due to noise at 50 Hz in Oslo recordings. To obtain reliable estimates, a Multaper approach was used based on discrete pro sleian sequences (dp) with 9 tapers for 10 segments, no overlap, frequency of ±0.5 Hz for anesthesia, and 29 tapers for 30 segments, no, overlap of ±0.5 Hz for sleep. Power of each state was averaged over all samples of the state and channels. For comparison, the effect was visualized at scalp level. Study 2 simultaneous recordings were not available. The analysis of influence of segment and tapers on spectral estimate was done by epching EEG into 30 segments and sleep into 10 segments. Time decomposition was done with fft with frequency of ±0.5 and dp tapers in 29 for anesthesia and 9 for sleep. The number of tapers was a result of choice segment and frequency. For comparison of signal-no ratios, Multaper decomposition was calculated as above. All computations were epched into 30 segments. Singleaper power was calculated using fft with no overlap and Hanning. Spectral estimates were between 0.5 and 45 in 0.5 steps. Periodogram used MATLAB's periodogram with rectangular window and points defined by sampling. Welch's method used 30 window no overlap with Hamming and points defined by sampling. Frequencies closest to Multi and Singleaper were chosen for analysis. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated by dividing power by standard deviation. Spectral slope was fitted by linear regression in log space between 30 and 45, excluding low frequencies with oscillatory and over 50 Hz. Time-resolved slope was calculated by best fit 10 or 30 segments in log space using polynomial fitting. One subject had excessive noise during wake, excluded from wake comparisons. Evaluation of center frequencies was done using intrran sleep as function different frequencies ±10 around 20 to 150 and fit lengths 30 to 100. Spectral was estimated low in 1 to 40 for anesthesia and 1 to 5 for sleep with irregular sampling. Two algorithms, FOF and eOSC, were used in 30 to 45 range. Mutual Information (MI) was calculated between hypogram and time-res slope, discretized into five bins Wake, REM, N1, N, N. Cortical sources were reconstructed using LCM beamforming with standard T MRI and BEM head model. Regions-of-interest (ROI) approach focused on prefrontal cortex (P) subregions. Linear discriminant analysis (DA) was used to assess slow power and spectral as predictors of wake and sleep. Leave-one-exempl-out cross-validation was repeated 50 times with equal sleep and REM samples. DA was trained on remaining and tested on held-out sample. Performance was percent correct. Two sleep participants excluded due to insufficient wake. DA was log-transformed and averaged across channels. General linear model used z-scored slow and spectral to model main effects and
This study investigates the role of microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) in the formation and dynamics of stromules, which are tubular structures that extend from chloroplasts in plant cells. The researchers used transgenic Nicotiana bentiana plants expressing fluorescent markers for MTs, AF, and stromules, and chloroplasts to observe their interactions and dynamics. They found that stromules extend along MTs, not AFs, and that MTs are required for strom formation and dynamics, and that AFs provide anchor points for stromules. The study also showed that MTs facilitate stromule extension and AF anchoring during effector-triggered immunity, leading to perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts. The researchers used inhibitors to depolymerize or stabilize MTs, and observed changes in strom dynamics and frequency, length, and velocity. They found that MT depolymerization reduced strom frequency and length, while stabilization increased frequency and length. The study also showed that AFs are required for strom anchoring, and that MTs facilitate strom extension and anchoring during effector-trigger immunity. The results suggest a model where MTs facilitate strom extension and AF anchoring during effector immunity, leading to perin clustering of chloroplast. The study provides insights into the role of MT and AF in strom formation and dynamics, and their importance in effector immunity.
Researchers have developed a method to predict residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. They found that amino acid identities of residues that make contact across interfaces covary during evolution and can be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes. Using a pseudo-likelihood method, they identified residue pairs that covary across protein-protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures and found that these pairs are almost always in contact in the complex, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average of the two proteins. They applied this method to predict subunit contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures and presented models for four complexes, including the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methion ABC transporter.

The study demonstrates that there is selective pressure at protein-protein interfaces beyond residue conservation and co-evolving pairs are nearly in contact in the complex. Not all contacting residues across interfaces co-evolve nor all protein-protein interfaces, but there is sufficient coevolution signal to constrain models of many complexes. Intra-monom and intersunit predicted contacts differ in utility for modeling, with more useful for proteinprotein complexes due to poorer representation in PDB. The approach constructs a global statistical model from paired alignments, applicable to any taxa, but focuses on prokary and mitochondria to avoid paralog problem.

Multiple sequence alignments were generated for 430 E. coli genes using HHbl and HHfilter in HHsuite. Redundancy was reduced by constructing HMs from MSA and clustering based on HH similarity. The benchmark set included 50 ribosome, NAD dehydrogen, and GatABotransfer complex. Alignments were realigned using clust omega1.2. Residues not present in query were dropped. Paired alignments were constructed from sequences with conserved intergenic distances and filtered to 90% identity and 75 gaps. HMMs were constructed for E. coli proteins and scanned PDB sequences in S2 database. Hits with e-value less 1-10 were considered.

GREIN constructs a statistical model from paired alignment, assigning probability to amino-acid sequence. Parameters were obtained by maximizing regularized pseudo-likelihood of alignment. Optimization was done using convex techniques. Normalized coupling strength was computed by vector 2-norm and corrected for variability. A model was constructed to estimate contact probability based on 50 ribosomal data. Coupling strengths were converted to residue-specific distance restraints and included in Rosetta prediction. Comparative models were built using Rosetta with co-evolution restraints for missing regions. Ros abio protocol consisted of centroid and fullatom stages. IAM was modeled with Ros membrane function and transmembrane regions predicted by MSA. 100,000 models were generated and 20 converged to cluster. Subset of 18 complexes were docked using Patch and Ros.
Active sensing in categorization of visual patterns involves accumulating information from multiple locations in a scene. A gaze-conting paradigm in a visual categorization task shows that participants' scan follows an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of the scene and statistical structure of patterns. Categorization performance improves with the number of revealings, indicating successful integration of information across fixations. The task requires multiple locations to be visited to extract abstract categories, unlike search tasks where a single location has the necessary information. Participants' eye movements depend on the underlying patterns, with positively correlated for same and negatively for different types. A Bayesian active sensor (BAS) algorithm, optimal in minimizing categorization with each revealing, was developed to assess participants' strategy. The BAS chooses the next fixation to maximize the reduction in entropy of the distribution over categories. Participants' eye movements were more efficient than heuristic strategies that employed a subset of elements of a closed-loop sensing, and about 70% as efficient as the AS with their prior, perception, and sacc inaccuracies. The inefficiency may be due to unmodeled constraints in human movement, such as biases for cardinal directions or fixating the center. Results contrast with studies suggesting eye movements do not follow an active strategy. Participants used prior knowledge and accumulated evidence to guide movements, unlike simple localization and search tasks. The task was more naturalistic, involving extraction of latent features, typical of sensorimotor processing. The gazeing display involved small patches, unlike natural vision's full field, with decreasing acuity away from the fovea. Participants' process was aware and optimized for the changed field. Basic statistics of macro-saccades were similar to natural, and no adaptation over days. The task focused on voluntary movements, scan of fixations, not involuntary microacc and drift. Stimuli had strictly stationary statistics, unlike natural's local nonstationarities. Time was limited, unlike natural's temporal aspects. A control showed additional time for rescanning did not affect initial strategy. The approach isolates top-down strategies, complementing low-level features and salience on movement. It focuses integrating low-level into abstract, complementing target value and cognitive tasks. The task ensured no single location was especially informative, requiring integration of multiple locations. A closed strategy was necessary for efficient solving. The interplay between information and fixation is characteristic of natural active sensing, most informative ever-changing dependent on history. The formal extends to tasks with arbitrary features, not spatial, such as categories. It provides fixation-fixation analysis under eye movements, matching observer to participants' performance. The first dissociates contributions of eye-movement from percept, motor, and processes, predominant sources of suboptim in sensing, and efficiency of each fixation throughout a scene. Three participants aged 25-35, neurologically healthy, normal or corrected vision, gave informed consent. The study was approved by ethics. Each took 12 hours, 6 days, 2 hours. Participants sat 42 in front of a 17" monitor. EyeLink 100 tracker tracked eye at 100Hz. Chin and forehead stabilized head. Stimuli generated from a two-dimensional process with mean and covariance. The function was squared-exponential, parameterized by horizontal and vertical length, with variance unity. Patterns were patchy, stripy horizontal, and stripy vertical, with hyperparameters 1.39, 1, 4.63, 0.91, and 0.91, respectively. Values -4 to 4 were mapped to RGB. Functions outside -4 were discarded, new generated. Images sampled 77 locations, supersampled 2Dines to 770. On trial, a category patchy or stripy was chosen with equal, stripy horizontal or vertical with equal. The task was to determine patch or stri, irrespective of horizontal or vertical. Four conditions: training, freecan, familiar, free, and passive. A control with no resc was performed. The ideal maintains
The study investigates the transport of large cargoes through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in eukaryotic cells, focusing on the requirements for nuclear import and the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors (NTR) via nuclear localization sequences (NLS). The researchers developed a set of model cargoes based on caps-like structures with tunable size and number of Ns, allowing for quantitative analysis of import in permeabilized cells. The results show that requirements for transport scale non-linearly with size and can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model correlating import to energetic requirements. For small cargoes, biochemical and physico properties influence transport, but for large cargoes, binding multiple Import complexes mask surface properties. The study expands the range of sizes and Ns characterised for nuclear import, highlighting the importance of shape, mechanical stability, and rigidity in transport. The biophysical model explains data well with two fitting parameters per caps (FR and ϵ) but raises questions about mechanisms facilitating large transport, such as NPC dilation and scaffold heterogeneity of FG distribution. The study provides a framework for understanding export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and RNA complexes.
CD28 is a co-stimulatory molecule essential for CD4 T cell priming and differentiation into effector cell subsets, and this study demonstrates a previously undescribed role for CD28 following cell activation. CD28 expression is required for the expansion of Th1 cells and differentiation and maintenance of Tfh after cell priming. Maintained CD28 is also required for clearance of enteropathic bacteria Citrobacter rodium after oral infection. Data show that even maintained CD28 is required for Th1 and Tfh, downstream effects of CD are different for each type. Impaired Th at day 7 but not earlier response likely due to reduced proliferation of CD+ cells, IL-2 driven at this time in response. T-prec from Cd28lox/flox40/+ mice have comparable proliferation to controls, but reduced in number, most pronounced in cells lost CD. CD:80 interactions important for T differentiation during T:B interactions. CD28 also required for maintenance of Tfh in germinal, preventing apoptosis. CTL-4 plays dominant role suppressing GC, CD supporting response via Tfh maintenance. CD interaction with CD80 important maintaining Tfh, CD86 dominant in formation T cells. IL-21 produced by Tfh induces CD upregulation on B cells, reciprocal dialogue between Tfh and B supports germinal response. CD is critical for formation regulatory cells and suppressive function periphery, also required presence Tfr and T subsets. Reduced expression IC and B-X in CDfh, PD and CTL- in Fox3 T examples changes. Reducing IC or B-X alone not sufficient recapitulate reduction T cell seen Cdlox/flox/+ mice. Loss CD on activated cells impair response foreign, implications accumulation CD-negative CD+ with age, HIV, disorders. Therapeutic targeting CD dampen established responses, interfering priming, especially autoimmunity.
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach and causes ulcers and gastric cancers. Its helical shape is necessary for efficient colonization, but the mechanisms behind its helical shape remain unclear. H. pylori is a model organism for studying helical cell shape due to its genetic tractability and compact genome. Non-redund non-essential contributors to shape have been identified, but the question of how it enables H. pyl to be helical remains largely unsolved. The peptoglycan (PG) cell wall sac is responsible for shape, purified cell walls maintain helical. PG is a polymer of alternating N-acetylglucamine (GlcNA) and N-acetyluric acid (NA) with attached peptide that can crosslink to adjacent strands. Cross-linked strands form the wall, a mesh-like molecule surrounding the cell and counteracting turg pressure. PG is synthesized in the cytoplasm and flipped across the inner membrane and incorporated into existing PG by glycosylase activities of penillin proteins (PB) and shape, elongation, division, and sporulation (ED) proteins, and transpeptase activities of PB. Helical shape in H. pyl requires a suite of PG-modifying enzymes C1, C3dp, C4, and C6 to remodel the wall and non-enzym proteins C2, C5, C, and C7 that act as scaffolds or other roles. One non-enzym protein is putative bactin C. Bactins are cytoskeletal proteins with diverse functions, playing a role in elongation in Caulobacter cresus and helical modulation Leptira biflex. C in H pyl, C loss results in rod-shaped cells with minimal sidew curvature. C has been shown to self-oligomer and co-pur with C5 and PG biosynthetic MurF. Patterning has been shown important for shape in model organisms. In E. coli, PG is directed preferentially synthesized to sites or below zero Gaussian curvature to promote rod shape by accelerating growth at dents and restricting growth at bulges along the sidew, enforcing diameter control. Bacillus subtilis PG filaments have been shown to move in paths approximately perpendicular to the long of rod-shaped cells, with orientations decreasing with increasing diameter. In H. pyl, we used metabolic probes to label sugar (NA-alk) and peptide (DA-alk) portions of PG. Both indicate synthesis at major and minor helical relative to rest sidew, with differences in peak magnitudes between NA- and DA probes. DA is thought to be incorporated through synthesis-associated D-transptases and wall-modifying D-transptases, complicating interpretation. H. pyl has no functional D-transptases and detectable 3-cross, hallmark D-transptase activity. Signal from DA likely reports D-trans activity. Only DA incorporation at penta observed. H pyl has pentape-rich wall and unclear if actively trimming. C3dp has shown weakape carypeptase in vitro. Trimming may contribute to helical shape. C dynamics may influence ability to promote shape. C does not require nucleotide cofactor polymerization but may mobile with motion PG machinery. In organisms, filaments travel circumferentially around cell, expected in H. pyl. Loss C results in cells with diminished curvature without helical twist. Promote by localized PG synthesis, C may also generate twist. Observed helical filaments in vitro are longer than foci seen immunofluorescence, but within cell may consist twisted bundles or skewed latt. C point variants show altered or polymer structures under various buffers in vitro and fail localize envelope in vivo. It unclear which structures relevant or disrupting C localization. Overall, results support a model where M-patterned rod is default for H. pyl and helical shape facilitated by major
Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaper, regulates mitochondrial dynamics by orchestrating the function of E3 ligases and deubiquases (DUBs). The study identifies a new role of C48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Ds Ubp and U2 exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on mitofus F1. C48 integrates activities of these Ds, which are themselves ubiquylated. First, C48 promotes proteolysis of U12, stabilizing pro-f ubiqulation on F1. Second, loss of U12 stabilizes U2, facilitating removal of ubiqu chains on F inhibiting fusion. Thus, C48 synergistically regulates ubiqulation of F, allowing balance between activation or repression of fusion. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles undergoing fusion and fission, modulated by various post-translational modifiers, including ubiquitin. Mitochondrial fusion is abolished in absence of F1 ubiqulation. C48 is essential for mitochondrial morphology, and the underlying mechanism is unclear. C48 is an AAA-ATase and one of the most abundant proteins in the cell, recognizing ubiqulated substrates and involved in myriad biological processes. C48 segregates ubiqulated substrates from complexes or membranes, allowing proteol by the proteome. C48 is required for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), modulates turnover of mitochondrial membrane (OM) proteins, participates in apoptosis, and mediates clearance of damaged lysosomes by autophagy. C48 binds E3 ubiquases and Ds, regulating ubiqulation. Ds are proteases catalyzing reversion of ubiqulation, contributing to ubiqu homeasis. Ds are associated with human diseases and represent drug targets, whose mechanism of action needs to be explored. Two deubiquases, U2 and U12, have opposite effects on mitochondrial morphology. U chains on F1 are recognized and cleaved by U, activating fusion. In contrast, chains on F are recognized and cleaved by U, targeting F for proteomal degradation and inhibiting fusion. C48 regulates U12, which regulates U2, explaining opposite effects of Ds on targets and ubiquasis. C48 maintains F1 ubiqulation, allowing balance between activation or repression of fusion. The study unravels a cascade of ubiqulation events comprising C48 and Ds fine-tuning fusogenic activity of F1.
This study investigated the representation of sound categories in the ventral occipital-temporal cortex (VOT) of early blind and sighted individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Twenty-four sounds from eight categories were presented to 34 early blind (EB) and 17 sighted (SC) participants, and 16 additional sight participants performed a visual version of the experiment. The results showed that VOT reliably encodes categorical information in both groups, with a similar topographical and representational structure. The top selectivity maps of the two groups were highly correlated, and the Jacc similarity was significant within and between groups. The number of voxels selective for each category was also similar between groups. Binary classification using support vector machine (SVM) showed that VOT can distinguish between categories in both groups. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) showed that the dissimilarity matrices (DSM) of the two groups were correlated. Representational connectivity between ROIs in VOT and the rest of the brain was also similar between groups. Permutation tests were used to assess statistical differences due to non-independence of data. The study suggests that VOT represents categorical information in a format similar way in early and sight individuals, and that cross-modal plasticity is constrained by intrinsic structure.
Entomophthora muscae, a fungal pathogen, infects Drosophila melanogaster, causing behavioral changes in the fly's final days of life. The fungus manipulates the fly's behavior, causing it to climb to a high location, extend its proboscis, and raise its wings, and die. The fungus grows inside the fly's body, producing conidiophores and conidia, which are ejected into the environment. The fungus infects the fly's nervous system, brain, and ventral nerve cord, and grows throughout the body. The fly's immune system responds to the fungus, but the fungus evades the response by growing protoplastically, without a cell wall. The fungus does not generate toxins, as it has no incentive to do so in the absence of host attack. The fungus manipulates the fly's behavior by secreting compounds into the hemolymph, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, altering neuronal activity. The fungus does not need to invade the CNS to affect behavior, it can secrete compounds into the hemol, changing the fly's internal state, leading to end-life behaviors.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome-wide binding of 30 RNA degradation factors in Saccharomy cerevisiae, a yeast. The researchers used photoactivatable ribonucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PARCLIP) to map the binding sites of 30 RNA degradation factors, including deadenylation, decapping, exosome, and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) factors. The results show that factors vary in their binding specificities for different classes of RNAs and locations on transcripts. Global comparisons with published profiles of other RNA-binding factors reveal clusters of co-occupying RNAs and co-localizing RN. The data are consistent with a large body of published results and extend to a global scale, revealing several novel findings. The Pan/Pan deadeny complex and C4/Not subunits preferentially bind to the p site, reflecting poly tail shortening at early stages of RNA degradation, while C4 bound strongly in the 5 region. Decapping factors show cross-link near the 3 end, consistent with previous binding near the p site. Profiles resemble those of 5 exonuclease X1, suggesting a complex formation with X1. The localization of 5 decapping and 3 deadlation near the 3 and 5 end, respectively, seems counterintuitive but may be explained by mRNA-loop formation where 5 and 3 ends are in proximity. Mature mRNPs may carry decapping near 3, and upon tailing decapping is activated, leading to decapping and RNA from 5. Decapping opens the loop, providing access for exonucleases and rapid removal. Decapping factors are enriched on non-optimal cods, agreeing with a link between translation and RNA from 5 through dec enhancer D1. Comparison with nuclear factors N1 and 3 reveals many show similar binding aberrant noncoding RN, particularly antisense upstream known, suggesting part of surveillance. N1/3 recognizes aberrant antisense, then adenylated by TR4, targeting degradation by exosome. Degradation of introns and ncRN upstream m on same, annotated Ns and CUTs, likely use same mechanism bound factors. Exosome involved 5 cytoplasm mRNA, processing and degradation long transcripts tRN, r, snRN. Differences in co-factor to RNA support specificity processing and degradation various species. Co-factor Ski shows 3 end mRN, mRN may targeted TR5 exosomal. Catalytic subunits R44 R6 and core near 5 end, exosome moves 3 5, then slows causing cross. The study provides a resource for testing hypotheses and understanding RNA degradation mechanisms.
A novel bivalent chromatin associated with rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis in response to pathogen in Arabidopsis was identified by combining publicly available epigen data with in vivo chromatin mapping. Camalex is an indole alkaloid derived from tryptan that can be rapidly induced by biotic and abiotic stimuli in Arabid. The biosynthetic enzymes belong to cyto P family, including CYPB, C71A13, and PHYALEIN DEFICIENT 3 (PAD). Expression of these genes can be induced by various abiotic biotic stresses and path-derived substances such as flagellin 22 (FL22) and oligogalactides. Previous studies revealed complex transcriptional and translational control of camalex biosynthesis. Transcription factors from MYB family, including MY34, MY51, and MY122, promote camalex biosynthesis in response Pseudas syring infection. WRKY functions as activator and binds to promoters of camalex biosynthesis. Besides factors, CALUMDEPENDENT PROTEIN KIN (CP)5/6 and MAP3/6 can phosphorylate WRKY to enhance promoter and activation. At translational, ribosome footprint showed genes involved camin bios, CYPB and C79, increased translational efficiency under triggered immunity. Despite knowledge of upstream regulators, rapid induction upon path signal remains unknown. Accessibility of gene to transcription is determined by dynamics of chrom states in eukotic cells. Chrom states controlled by epigen modifications that influence nucleosome. Epigen modifications constitute coval decoration of chemical to histones and DNA, associated promoting or repressing gene by altering chrom accessibility to factors. Trimylation of lysine 27 of hist 3 (HK27me) represses gene by increasing chromensation and limiting recruitment factors. Epigen marks play opposite roles on gene can co-localize at same regions forming bivalent chromat. Bivalent chromatins were observed in mammalian cell types, including H27me and H4me. In Arabid, H27-H4 bivalent was observed at FLOW LOCUS (FL) and associated cold stress in potato. A novel bivalent formed H27 and H1 was identified in Brassica. Bivalent can be formed by pairs of epigen marks. The function of bivalent has been proposed to poise expression developmental genes for rapid activation. However, this has been tested only in mammalian stem and cancer cells. This study examined the role of H27-H bivalent on camin biosynthesis in Arab. Epigen marks were enriched in camin biosynthesis using omics-driven approach integrating 16 available epigen profiles with Arab genome metabolic annotation. High-resolution ep profiles including hist variants, DNA methylation, and hist modifications were obtained from seedlings grown under similar conditions. Ep marks were mapped on metabolic domains, genes, and pathways using genome functional annotations. Enrichment analysis revealed patterns, including specialized metabolism being with repression H27 and activation H18. Correlation H27 and H18 on Arab genome was observed previously. Specialized genes contributed to correlation of these marks on metabolic. 37% of metabolic genes were marked by both H27 and H18. Several pathways, including camin and glucosinate biosynthesis, were enriched with ep marks. The nature of H-H association was examined on camin biosynthesis. Two hypotheses were proposed: H and H co-localized on same genes controlling expression or associated different cells determining specificity. SeqIP-qPCR confirmed co-localization of H27 and H on camin biosynthesis genes. Transcription kinetics of camin biosynthesis under FL treatment was examined in wild and mutant lines defective H27 or H. Induction was accelerated or delayed, respectively. Results provide evidence for ep regulation of camin at epigen level.
Distinct and separable roles of EZH2 in neurogenic astrocytes in the adult subventricular zone (SV) of the mouse and human brain were investigated. EZ2, a Polycomb repressive factor, was found to be specifically expressed in neurogenic astrocytes in the SV, but not in non-neurogenic astrocytes. Deletion of EZ2 in SV cells resulted in decreased neurogenesis, which was partially due to reduced cell proliferation. Ink4, a cell cycle inhibitor, was enriched with H3K27me and EZ2 methyltransferase, and deletion of EZ increased Ink expression. EZ2 was required for Ink repression, and BMI1 was required for subsequent transcriptional repression by PRC1. Olig2, a bHL transcription factor, was identified as a direct target of EZ2-mediated repression, and its expression was critical for neurogenesis. EZ2 was also required to prevent aberrant expression of homeomain-containing transcription factors, including those involved in embryonic development of non-OB neurons. EZ2 was not observed in mature non-neuro astrocytes, but its expression was common in high-grade gliomas, including glioblastoma multiform GB. Inhibition of EZ in GB cell lines resulted in decreased proliferation, but loss of EZ function could lead to aberrant expression of factors like OL2, driving tumorigenesis. In the human brain, EZ2 was expressed in GF+ astroia in the SV when neurogenesis was observed, but not in 18-month-old brain when SV neurogenesis was sparse. Overall, EZ2 was a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the SV and played distinct roles in neurogenesis and gliagenesis.
This study investigated the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP bacteria in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) using single-cell genomics and metagenomics. The researchers collected samples from Saichlet, a fjord on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and analyzed 315 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from 100-185 meters depth. They identified 136 SAGs affiliated with SUP or ArcticBD-19 lineages and sequenced their genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct lineages, SUP and ArcticBD-19, with SUP being more prevalent in anoxic/anoxic waters and ArcticBD-19 in oxygenated waters. Viral contigs were detected in 30 SUP SAGs, affiliated with Caudirales and Microvir families, with Caudir being more common in SUP_01 and Micro in SUP_03. Co-infection between ssDNA and ds viruses was observed, and auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) with potential to modulate electron transfer essential to SUP metabolism were identified. Viral dsC, a critical in SUP energy metabolism, was found in 7 SUP_01 contigs and similar to hydrothermal plume phages. Viral dsC was abundant in Saichlet over 3 years, peaking with blooming SUP populations. Functional characterization of viral dsC is needed to constrain roles in modulating SUP electron transfer during infection. The study used single genomics to link SUP viruses and hosts across gradients of oxygen and sulf over 3 years, revealing endemic patterns of co-infection between ss and ds viruses and occurrence of AM with potential to modulate electron reactions essential to SUP metabolism. Findings offer novel perspectives on ecology and evolution of infecting uncult bacterial populations.
In this study, researchers investigated the function of TTC26/DY13, a protein involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT) in Chlamdomonas reinhardtii and zebrafish. They found that TTC26/DY13 is an IFT B protein, part of the IFT complex, and undergoes I at the same speed as other I proteins, but is not necessary for I assembly or movement of I complexes. Instead, TTC/DY13 is important for assembling full-length cilia/flagella in both zraf and C. reinii. Knockdown of TTC in zraf embryos and C reinii dy13 mutant showed motility defects, caused by lack of inner dyne arm components in c/flagella. Analysis of suppressor mutant if46 revealed that I46 is required for transport of outerne arms into flagella, while TTC/D13 is for innerne arms. The researchers also found that TTC/D13 transports other flag proteins into flagella, including those related to motility, such as F59, Enase, R72, PF2, and centrin. LIS, a dyin regulatory factor, accumulated in dy13 flagella, suggesting a secondary effect of motility defects. Proteomic analysis identified 16 proteins reduced in dy13 flagella, most related to motility, including F59, En, R72, PF, and centrin. The study suggests TTC/D13 plays a role in transporting mot-related cargoes and assembling full c/flag.
Lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) play a crucial role in the metastasis of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Researchers investigated the interaction between LEC and melanoma cells in 2D and 3D co-cultures. They found that LEC contact with metastatic melanoma cells triggered changes in the localization of matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14), a protease involved in cancer invasion, leading to expression and activation of Notch and β-integrin, resulting in a change in 3D growth of melanoma. This interaction did not induce metastasis or change 3D growth in nonmetastatic Bow cells. Ectopic expression of MP14 or NIC3 did not induce change 3 growth in nonmetatic cells. However, ectopic expression of NIC3 in WM793 cells, a nonmetast cell line, induced invas sprouting phenotype dependent on β-integr. WM cells with intrinsic expansive growth capacity switched to invas sprouting after L-mediated activation of MP-Not3-β-int axis, resulting in MP and Not3-dependent metastasis in vivo. LEC also switched metast WM165 cells to invas spr via MP-Not-3-β axis. WM793 and Bow cells did not respond to L contact by activating key effectors for metast phenotype. Melanoma invasion is associated with changes in tissue degrading proteases, including MMPs. LEC increased MP14 on melanoma plasma and cell contacts in metastatic melanoma lines, accompanied by MP-dependent Not3 upregulation. MP interacts with Not1 at melanoma cell membrane, supporting growth. Not receptors 1 and 3 are activated in melan with pro-torig functions, but Not-activating mutations in melan. MP-dependent Not3 upreg may be important in metast melan progression. LEC induced β-integr activation in metast WM and WM165, required for 3 sprouting WM. β-int dependent on MP as depletion abolished β-int and slightly reduced total-int. Previous studies demonstrated MP incorporation into β-int adhesion complexes and MP binding β upon mammary morphogenesis. Melan metastases express activated β-int more than primary tumors. Current results add to concept of stromatic contribution to melan metastasis via β-int activation. Negative regulator β-int, IC-1, restricts angiogenesis by upregulating Not ligands and downstream factors in endothelial cells, but not involved in Not-dependent sprouting metast melanoma. MP, Not3, and β-int are linked to epithelial-mesymal transition in carcinoma metastasis, suggesting metast WM and WM have undergone transition to mesymal state for hematogenous dissemination. However, Bow cells with MP did not metastas, MP activity not enough for efficient colonization. Capacity for transient 3 invasive sprouting and expansive behavior required for melanoma to enter blood and colonize distant organs. Melan progression is driven by reversible phenotypic plasticity, changes in tumor microenvironment direct phenotype-switch, but mechanisms unknown. Results support role of reversible-switch in melan progression and stromatic endothelium as trigger for hematogenous and tissue colonization.
This study investigates the role of microRNA-9 (miR-9) in dendritic development and synaptic plasticity in the brain. The researchers generated a transgenic mouse model that allows for conditional inactivation of miR-9 in a spatio-temporally controlled manner, allowing them to study its function in vivo. They found that mi-9 is highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes, but not in microglial cells. Overexpression of mi-9 promotes dendritic growth and synaptic plasticity, while inhibition of mi-9 leads to reduced dendritic growth and impaired synaptic transmission. The study also found that mi-9 regulates the expression of the transcriptional repressor REST, which is involved in neuronal differentiation. Overexpression of REST leads to reduced dendritic growth and complexity, while downregulation of REST rescues the dendritic defects caused by mi- inhibition. The study suggests that mi- plays a key role in regulating dendritic development and synaptic plasticity through REST.
This study investigated the neural basis of social engagement in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in toddlers aged 12-48 months. The researchers found that the default mode network (DM), a brain circuit involved in social cognition and social communication, was functionally disconnected from lower-level visual networks in ASD toddlers, but not in typically developing (TD) toddlers. The DM-occipital cortex (DM-OT) connectivity was specifically reduced in the Geo ASD subtype, characterized by a lack of social engagement, but not in non-ASD groups. Individual variation in DMOT connectivity was associated with social-communication difficulties in Geo ASD. The Geo subtype was identified using a simple eye-tracking test of social vs. non-social preferences in early development. The study controlled for sex and age at scanning as covari. The sample size of Geo ASD was relatively small (n=16), so a power analysis was conducted to determine the minimum effect size to detect the null hypothesis with 80% power. The effect size to achieve 80 power was d=0.51. The eye-tracking data has been reported in prior studies (Pierce et al., 2011; Pierce et al., 2016). The eye-tracking test consisted of a movie with dynamic geometric or social stimuli on either side of the screen. The dynamic stimulus was from animated screen programs, and social from children doing yoga. The stimulus was composed of 2 areas of interest (AOIs) horizontally containing geometric or social and changed simultaneously. The side of presentation was randomly assigned subject and fixation within AO calculated. The movie contained 28 scenes with single-scene duration 2-4s for total time 60 at 24 frames per second. To examine behavioral on clinical measures (ADOS, Mullen, Vineland), the largest Geo ASD sample was used. An additional 44 Geo ASD had eye and clinical data but not fMRI were included. Linear-effect analyses were used to model within-individual and group trajectories. The variables were ADOS, Mullen, Vineland subscores, while independent age, group, and age*group. The linear model provided a better fit. Imaging was collected on 1.5 Tesla scanner during sleep; no sedation was used. High-resolution anatomical scans were for warping into atlas. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was measured with echoplan imaging (TE=30, TR=250, flip=90, bandwidth=70, field view=25.6, in-plane=4, slice=4, 31). The resting session 6:25 resulting 154 volumes. Within preprocessing discarded first 4 for T-stabilization, leaving 150 for analysis. Core preprocessing included slice correction, rigid head correction, obity, affine registration, warping MNI, spatial smoothing, and intensity normalization. Denising included wavelet despiking and confound regression. Wavelet denising mitigated spatial and temporal heterogeneity motion artifact. The 13-parameter regression motion and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal was used. Framewise displacement and DVARS were similar across groups before and after denising. To assess connectivity, independent component analysis (ICA) was used to group and dual regression back-project spatial and time for each subject. Group-ICA dimension was fixed 30. Time for subject and component used model-component. Partial correlations were used to estimate connection strengths. General linear models (GL) tested between-group differences partial correlations. The primary variable was group. The case model was ASD and non-AS labels. The controls were non-AS groups TD, LD, and ASDib. The strat model used Geo and nonASD subtypes. The models computed each pair and threshold FDR q<0.05. If pairs survived FDR, further pairwise-comparisons were with FDR q<0.05. Effect sizes estimated Cohen's d.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces plasocytes and crystal cells that are released upon pupation. However, throughout larval development, both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasocytes can proliferate, but it is unknown if crystal cells increase by self-renewal or de novo. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent plasocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in sessile clusters and is contingent on the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling to blood homeostasis creates a new paradigm for addressing questions in Dophila hematopoies and establishing parallels with vertebrate systems. Insects have diverse hemocyte functions, including phagocytosis, extracellular matrix production, encapsulation, and melanization, similar to vertebrates. Hemocyte types are compartmentalized into different cell types, with mature cells retaining the ability to divide in circulation, but most proliferation and differentiation occur in hematopoiet organs. In Dophila, embryonic hematopois produces plas and crystal cells, with plasocytes being phagocytic and crystal nonagytic. Hemocytes in larva are found in circulation but mostly attached to the cuticle as sessile, forming clusters in every segment. Hemocytes in clusters are not randomly dispersed but stereotypical, indicating signal must direct them to locations. Nervous system (P) neurons attract hemocytes and provide trophic molecules for survival. The lar also has a hematopoiet organ, the lymph, where plas and crystal differentiate from proocytes. Proocytes in the medullary zone are instructed by the posterior signaling center (PSC) to maintain quiescence or differentiate into plas or crystal cells. Hemocytes in the lymph do not disperse until pupation or injury. In homeost conditions, differentiated hem in lymph do not contribute to circulating and sess hem population. However, hem population expands throughout lar development. Plas are mitotically active, expanding larval by renewal, while crystal do not divide during lar stages, although proliferate during embryogenesis. We show that crystal cells increase in third instar by novo differentiation from plas. Not signaling is necessary for crystal formation, with Serr as the ligand. Serr is expressed in hemocytes, which induce crystal development. Contact between hemocytes is necessary for Not activation. Hem clusters are necessary for crystal differentiation, as disrupting them reduces H+L+ cells. Hem clusters are dynamic, with cells entering and leaving circulation, and have higher division rate than circulating counterparts.
This study investigates how yeast cells tolerate gene duplication and evolve new phenotypes. Researchers found that up to 40% of amplified genes in aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. Reduced expression is due to heritable polymorphisms that downregulate amplified genes, some selected during adaptation to anupidy. Reduced expression in other amplified genes, 30-36 in some strains, appears to be actively regulated proportion to increased dosage. Dosage compensation is prevalent, likely in other species, explaining lack of expression noted for autosomal genes in Drosila and humans. Specific functional classes, including RP and mitochondrial proteins, point to targeted processes. Dosage-compensated genes include multi-sub protein complexes and pathways, but balance hypothesis not supported. RP dosage likely via feedback to modulate mRNA. Feedback known for RP, including unas L32, binds stem structure and inhibits intron splicing, triggering mRNA degradation. Results imply feedback pertains to other RP, including R15, lacking intron. Mitochondrial dosage less clear; proteins regulate translation or stability shared transcripts. Dosage at transcript level provides additional regulation to stoichiometry. Natural isolates generally tolerant anupidy, or had time adapt extra chromosome. Common response in aneup strains, upreg oxidoreduct and down mitochondrial respiration. Respiratory capacity not defect in anup yeast, implications unclear. Human variability in DS sensitivity, genetic effects pathologies. Strain-specific responses Chr amplification, dosage vs heritable expression. Some Classa genes misclassified, possibility genetic variation dosage. Expression-compens genes controlled proportion copy, many escape dosage response anidy, contribute phenotyp variation. Whole partial amplification common laboratory experiments, prevalent mutants fitness. Saccharomot stable, eight or sixteen chromosomes. Anupidy transient, generated readily lost selective pressures. Selection for stress produced anup strains, solutions persisted. Anupidy frequent nature, route natural variation.
The article discusses the discovery of a new type of photoreceptor, called xenops, in the flatworm Marigella croi. Xenops is a subtype of opsin, a protein responsible for light-dependent reactions in photoreceptors, and is found in the ciliary cells of the larval epider eye and cerebral eye, as well as in extraocular cells in the adult. The study shows that xenin is expressed in different types of ciliary cells with distinct ciliary arrangements, including modified cilia in the larval epider eye, unmodified cilia in the cerebral eye, and unmodified cilia enclosed in phaosomes in extraocular cells in adult. Xenin expression in the ciliary of lar eyes is similar to other lophrozoa, but the cerebral eye of polad lar consists of distinct rhaberic and ciliary cells. The morphology of xenin+ cells in adult is unique, with ciliary membranes enclosed within their own plasma membrane, like gnost rods and some invertebrate pha. The number of cilia in pha is striking and may be a feature of Marig and other flatworms. The study provides evidence that xenin forms a photopment with 9-c retinal and drives light-dependent decrease in cAMP, blocked by pertuss toxin, indicating it signals via Gi transduction. Xenin also drives transient increase intracellular Ca+ but this response is blocked by pertuss toxin, reflecting cros with Gi signaling, not Gq. Data indicate xenin capable of promuous signaling, specifically when Gi is inactivated by pertuss toxin, xen acts increase c in response to light, revealing coupling to Gs or another undefined toxin-insensitive pathway. In unpert HEK cells, xenin suppresses c through Gi coupling is primary effect. Compared to rodopsin, xenin is irrevers activated by light in assay, with no change over tens minutes. This may reflect incompatibility with G kinases and arrest or thermally stable state. Several aspects of xenin signaling must be explored, including relevant messengers, kinetics in native cells, G subunits expressed, spectral sensitivity, efficiency, and cofactors. The study adds to diversity of animal photore and phototransduction being discovered as species are studied.
The study investigates how spatial and temporal factors integrate to specify neuronal diversity in Drosila neuroblasts. Spatial patterning generates 30 neuroblast identities, but is insufficient to account for neuronal diversity in the nervous system. Temporal patterning, regulated by transcription factors (TFs), is required to generate distinct neurons and glia within each neuroblast. The study uses Targeted Dam (Ta) to map Hunch (H) binding in NB-6 and NB-4 neuroblasts, which produce distinct neurons. H has different targets in each lineage, ruling out the independent specification model where H binds identically in neuroblasts. Chromatin accessibility by Dam (CaDa) shows global differences between NB-6 and NB-4 lineages. H-bound loci in NB-6 are enriched for open chromatin in NB-6, while H-bound loc in NB-4 are enriched for open chrom in NB-4. Gsb, a spatial transcription factor, is enriched at open chrom in NB-6 but not NB-4, supporting the sequential model where STFs generate lineage-specific chrom landscapes. H-bound loc in NB-6 are enriched for G occupancy, suggesting H binds where chrom is open or H opens chrom. The study pushes the limits of Ta by analyzing the smallest number of cells to date, 8-12 cells per hemisegment, and shortest expression time, 5 hr. The results support the sequential model where STFs generate lineage-specific chrom landscapes, leading to lineage-specific TF binding and neuronal specification. The study provides new insights into how spatial and temporal factors integrate to generate neuronal diversity in Dila neuroblasts and has implications for understanding vertebrate neurogenesis.
A study used photo-switch tweez to investigate the function of a trimer ion channel P2 receptors. The photo-switch tweez were used to probe large-scale motions of the protein in physiological conditions. The study found that a decrease in the distance between the inner and outer ends of pore-lining TM helices is essential for activation of the P2 receptor. The photo-switch twe were used as molecular rulers to measure structural changes in the protein. The study showed that photo-switch twe can be used to investigate alloster mechanisms of membrane proteins. The P2 receptors are trimeric ion channels that rapidly switch between closed and open conformations in response to extracellular ATP.

This study investigates the mechanisms of cell-type variation in cytokinesis in the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Cytokinesis is the physical division of one cell into two, powered by constriction of an actomy contractile ring. It has been assumed that animal cells divide similarly, but evidence suggests cell-type variation in regulation. The study used thermetics, drug treatment, and embryo dissection to probe mechanisms of cell-type variation among blastomeres in the four-cell embryo. Cell-type differences were found in functional and temporal levels of formin-1 activity, but not myosin activity during cytokinesis. Formin-1 inhibition resulted in cytokinesis in AB and AB blasteres, but EMS and P blasteres were protected against cytokinesis and divided successfully. Isolated blasteres showed that P is protected against cytokinesis due to cell-intrinsic regulation, independent of contact with other blasteres. In contrast, EMS was protected by extrinsic due to cell contact with P and Src-mediated cell signaling. The study established the C elegans four-cell as a system to study cytoketic diversity and suggests that cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cell-type cytoketic. The advantages of protecting specific lineages against cytokinesis are unclear, but may ensure representation of all lineages in the developing worm. The study provides insights into mechanisms of cell-type cytokinesis and its importance in development and disease.
A study on the symbiosis between Vibrio fischer and the Hawaiian bobtail squid reveals a new role for the flagellar sheath in mediating the release of immunogenic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both V. fischer and its pathogen Vibrio cholera. The flagellar sheath has been difficult to study due to a lack of mutations that result in loss of she in sheathed flagella. A Vibrio species, including human pathogen Vibrio parahemolytic, encode two flagellar structures: one sheathed and unshe flagella. However, pleiotropic effects of mutations and technical limitations make direct comparison of unsathed and sheathed flagella difficult. The role of she, as it relates to motility, remains poorly characterized, and observation of this phenomenon for flagellar sheath furthers understanding of this enigmatic structure and contribution to virulence. Flagellar rotation in V. fischer promotes release of immunogenic LPS, required for normal induction of apoptotic development in squid. The flag she may serve to promote recognition by host immune system, suggesting context-dependent mutualism or pathogenesis of behavior. Masking immunostimulatory molecule (e.g., flagellin) with another (e.g., L) can modulate rather than avoid detection by host system. The flA and mot1 mutants still release L in culture, albeit reduced, observed attenuation of apoptotic induction suggests threshold of L sensed by host exquisitely calibrated to amount L shed by V. fischer; V. fischer cells not dividing during symbiotic, flag-mediated L release predominant source L to host exposed; or L released by V. fischer somehow presented immunically active than flA orB mutant. This emphasizes heterogeneity of L made by V. fischer and insolubility in aqueous solution and toxicity of medium to squid makes comparing chemical or activity between culture and symbiotic settings problematic. The study used V. fischer strains: wild-type, flA, mot1, andX; V. cholera O3951 and motAB; E. coli RP and motAB. Strains grown in Luria-Bert, SWT, and tryone media. Growth, soft-agar motility, and flagellar structures examined by TEM. mot1 open frame amplified by PCR and cloned into pSV. Complementation construct and control conjugated into V. fischer and mot1. Cell-free supernatants serially diluted and reactogenic L detected by Toxin Chromogenic LAL assay. LPS in uninoculated media serially diluted pyrogen water determined fewer than 50 units/ml. Data presented mean and standard of mean for at least biological replicates. Statistical repeated-measures ANVA and paired t-test used to normalize variability basal L released wild-type across experiments.
Catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants is a phenomenon associated with mitotic errors and can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty. This study describes extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in Arabidopsis plants expressing centromere histone H3. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lagg chromosome compartmental within micronus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring genomic novelty. The study provides a tractable natural system investigating causes and mechanisms of genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

The study used GFP-tswap haploid inducer in the Col- background carries a homozygous CEN3 mutation complemented by chimer CEN3 with N-terminal GFP fused to H3.3. The strain was crossed to polym accession gl-1 to track haplotypes in F1 progeny and obtained expected haploid frequency. Dosage and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of diploids found 100% were diploid with 50% Col and Ler genomes. Anuploids exhibited pleiotropic morph defects, except when GL locus was lost. Five primary tris phenotypes were recognized: Chr tris have green serrated and dwarf leaves, Chr exhibit round and late flowering, Chr have narrow green, Chr display smaller, and flat, and Chr light and narrow. Anup plants with severe or unusual phenotypes were observed, suggesting other chromosomal combinations or aberrations.

Chromosome analysis distinguished three types anup: numerical, truncated, and shattered. Numerical anupids display whole anup such as primary tris. Primary tris account 75% of numerical class. Double tris, tripleis, and quadruple tris were also observed. Disomic haploids and monomic haplo were found at 4% frequency. Anup resulting from mit failure do not have meiotic constraints.

The shattered class was found in 22% anup population. Truncated class was found in 22% anup. Some anupids exhibited combination of numerical and shattered types. Dosage alteration for Chr, 2, and 3 were similar based on average copy alteration all chromosomes. Chr 4 and 5 were over- and under-represent, respectively. This may be due to uneven distribution of dosage-sensitive genes. Truncations have been reported in self tris.

Assessing whether truncated and shattered anup types were from meiotic misse, sequenced 96 produced by self Col- triploid. Most were anup. Dos analysis revealed all anup. Assessing whether trunc and shattering were from GFP-tswap defects, sequenced 96 from GFPswap and observed 98% were dip, two carried primaryis Chr and Chr. Based on results, believe truncated and shattered classes reflect genomic instability with mit errors in embryo.

Shattered chromosomes can be from five Arabid chromosomes. In some cases, sh appears to extend two chromosomes because GFPswap carries reciprocal Chr/Chr trans. SNP demonstrates duplicated and triplicated originated from GFPswap. Single regions displaying loss heterozyg carry Ler alleles, consistent with loss GFP haplotype.

To reconstruct junctions, sequenced FR000 to 100 coverage, extracted pairs ends duplicated and triplicated, and de novo assembled 38 junctions. A subset 12 were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. All junctions were consistent NHE with microhomology, blunt fusions, or unidentified insertions. Inversions were observed in 47% junctions. Size of microology and insertions are shown.

Duplicated and triplicated sizes FR000 were
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widespread human pathogen that causes various cancers, including lymphomas and epithelial malignancies. EBV expresses six latent genes, including Epstein-B Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA) and Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP), which promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. EBV-infected B cells are resistant to apoptosis, but the mechanism is unclear. BH profiling was used to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis before and after EB infection in primary human B cells. Mature B cells depend on BCL-2 for survival, while EB infection suppresses apoptosis by upregulating M-1 and B-1. EBNA3 regulates M-1 localization and B-1 transcription, promoting resistance to B-antagonist AB-737. EB3 regulates chromatin through an enhancer facilitating NF- activation of B- transcription. This study highlights a cooperative role among EB3, EB2, and L1 in EB-immortal cell survival, supporting the germinal center model of EB infection. EB-infected cells promote M-1, similar to GC cells in mice, and M- copy gains are found in lymphomas. EB recombinant lacking L1 forms tumors in humanized mice, suggesting survival depends on EB3 and M-1. BH profiling is a predictive tool for chemotherapeutic responses in leukemias, suggesting its potential for EB-associated malignancies.
This study investigated the genetic, environmental, and demographic factors that shape the variation in aliphatic glucosinolates (GSLs) in Arabidopsis thalian across Europe. A collection of 797 accessions from the 100 Genomes catalog were analyzed, and GSLs were measured in seeds. The results showed that environmental conditions, together with geography, affect the presence and distribution of chemotypes within accessions. Specific traits were associated with specific environmental conditions, and this association shifted across the continent. Comparing associations of traits to specific conditions in Central Europe versus south revealed different behaviors, demonstrating chemotypic variation across Europe created by a blend of processes that differ at individual loci. This implies simultaneous analysis of genotype and phenotype is required to interpret processes and relationships. Abiotic factors, such as climate, may indirectly influence GSL through biotic factors like herbivores. Aliph GSLs were mechanistically linked to drought resistance in Arabid, suggesting potential for abiotic influence on diversity. Three major GSL loci display allelic heterogeneity, shaped by parallel or convergent evolution. GS-O provided evidence of parallel evolution, where a functional haplotype gave four LO alleles with similar phenotypic consequence. GSOP showed potential convergent-style events leading to MS chemotype from LO events. Epistasis shapes allelic heterogeneity at loci and evolutionary. Epistatic contingency exists between GSOP and GS-E loci. Epist also exists between A3 alleles GSOP and GS-E. Within-loc epist in GS-E locus, functional M1 creates C GSL regardless M2 state. Alleles do not have equal evolutionary potential, e.g., clade 4 can mutate to C or C chem, while cl3 lost M1 prevents C creation. Evolutionary trajectory of haplotype at one locus epastically conditioned by alle state all loc within lineage. Allelic diversity raises question how pathways pass speciation boundaries. Brassica sp. have variation GS-E and GSOP creating same chemotyp found in Arabid. Within-spec GSOP and between-spec GSOP GS-E variation in A. lyr, A. petea, and A. haller, independent at A and M loci. This suggests variation recreated in species, possibility of class loci repeatedly sampled pangen variation. Other biotic genes, like R-gene loc, have moderate ancient alleles creating phenotyp variation. GSL loc have blend structural and SNP variation, young alleles. Work needed to assess range allelic in adaptive loc. Allelic at GSL illustrates tracking phenotype and genotype to understand distribution variation. Iber and Mediterranean had low aliph chemotypes, strong geographic structure, while Central/North had high aliph diversity, overlapping distributions. GSOP fixed Alyl in Iber/Mediterranean, alternative GSOP in Central. Chemotyp divergence genomic expectations driven GSOP. Chem in one region created combination alleles, gene flow, generation, local pressures.
The study investigates the role of caspases in the neoplastic behavior of scrib− Ras12 mutant cells in Drosila. Caspases are traditionally considered tumor suppressors, but recent work suggests they can also have tumor-promoting functions. The study shows that oncogenic Ras12 switches the apoptotic activity of casases to tumor-promoting in scrib− Ras12 cells, maintaining them in an 'ead-like state. Casases induce apoptosis in few cells but promote intra- and extracellular ROS, required for growth and invasion of neop cells. Casases are activated in scri− Ras12 clones, as shown by cleaved casase-3 labeling, but do not trigger significant apoptosis. ROS are essential for recruitment and activation of hemocytes, which release Eiger, stimulating J signaling in scri− Ras cells. The study proposes an amplification loop of J, casases, ROS, and hemocytes in scri− Ras12, necessary for tumor initiation. This contrasts with scri− cells, where J signaling triggers casase activation and apoptosis. The ampl loop ensures persistent oncogenic signaling in scri− Ras cells, promoting growth and invasion.
A study investigated the effect of social interaction on subjective duration and its relationship with social proficiency. Participants were shown point-light displays of agents engaging in communicative and non-communicative interactions, and asked to report which sequence appeared longer in duration. Results showed that communicative sequences were perceived as shorter than non-communicative, with a significant difference of 69.3 ms in the upright condition and 0 ms in the inverted condition. This effect was not due to low-level visual features or spatial-temporal correlations between agents. Experiments 2 and 3 manipulated temporal delay and spatial swap of stimuli, but the effect remained. The effect was also not due to inference of causality or contingency between entities' movements. Experiments 4 and 5 showed that socially proficient individuals were more susceptible to the effect than less proficient, with a negative correlation between autistic tendency and effect. Ex 5 found that oxytocin administration increased the effect in less proficient, while atiban decreased it in proficient. Ex 6 found atiban decreased the effect in proficient. The study suggests that subjective time is idiosyncratic and ingrained with social traits, and oxyin plays a role in mediating perception of social interactions.
The study investigated the effects of common mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE) on their binding affinity and kinetics. The researchers analyzed five RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE mutations (S19 and K26) using surface plas resonance (SPR) at 37°C, avoiding common pitfalls such as protein aggregation, mass-transfer limitations, and rebinding. The wild-type R/ACE interaction had a dissociation constant (KD) of 74 nM and association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rates of 0.9 μM-1s-1 and 0.067 s-1, respectively. The R mutations N501, E484, and S477 increased the affinity by 10, 1.5, and 1.5-fold, respectively, while K417 and K417 decreased it by 2 and 4-fold, respectively. The combination of N501 and E484 in VOC-102-02 increased the affinity by 15-fold. The ACE mutations S19 and K26 increased the affinity of wild-type RBD by 3.7 and 2.4-fold, respectively. The effects of ACE mutations on R variants were largely independent, except for the combination of S19 and S477, which had a lower affinity than predicted. The study suggests that the N501, E484, and S477 mutations enhance transmission by increasing affinity, while K417 and K417 facilitate immune escape.
A map of genetic interactions in metazoan cells was generated by combinatorial RNA interference and single-cell phenotyping. 136 genes implicated in biological processes such as signalling, chromatin biology, and cell cycle regulation were tested in pairwise combinations with 72 query genes. 21 phenotypic features were extracted from imaged cells, and genetic interactions were calculated using a multiplicative model. 61 gene pairs showed significant genetic interactions at FDR 0.01, and interactions were non-reduant for each feature. Directional interactions were identified by testing the 21-dimensional interaction vectors against the single effects of each gene.134 pairs showed directional interactions, with 104 alleviating and 304 aggravating. The map revealed relationships between genes and complexes, such as the SWI/S chrom remodelling complex and Ras signalling. SW/SNF members alleviated the knockdown of Ras1, while Ras1 aggravated it. Knockdown of SW/S members compensated the RasAP-dependent proliferation. Mutations in SW/S members rescued the rough eye phenotype caused by constitutively active Ras in vivo. In human colon cancer cells, SW/S members interacted with constitutively KRAS. Recurrently mutated genes in cancer, such as PTEN and TSC2, showed alleviating interactions. ARP3, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, aggravated the phenotype of Sos. Myb, a member of the DREAM complex, was regulated by mip and mip. The phenotype of spEN was aggravated by non, involved in nonsense-mediated decay. jumu and N75 formed an epatic network with alleviating and aggravating interactions. The study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale, automated discovery of directional epist interactions and provides a resource for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships. The approach can be extended to detect mixed relationships and combined with Bayesian modelling to improve inference networks.
Heterostly is a widespread adaptation that promotes outbreeding, but its genetic and evolutionary origins are poorly understood. In Primula (primes), heterly is controlled by the Slocus supergene that determines reciprocal reproductive organ and incompatibility between morphs. The identities of the component genes remain unknown. This study identifies Prim CYP50, a putative brassoster-degrading enzyme, as the locus that determines style dimorphism. C50 is present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-m styles, and loss leads to long styles. The gene arose by duplication specific to Primaceae and shows accelerated molecular evolution. Results provide a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and shed light on the evolution of Sloc as a model for complex supergene. Heterly evolved once in genus Primula, so the causal should co-segregate with phenotypes in heterylous Prim species. To test C50, sequenced transcriptomes of distantly P and-m. The C50 homologue was exclusively expressed in S, but not-m styles. Each of five exons was amplified from S-m, but not-m. Genome sequencing detected no C-specific reads in-m, and coverage in-m was half of a related. Presence/absence polymorphism has been maintained as trans in linkage with G over 20 million years, indicating strong selection as for causal locus. The hypothesis C50 represents G and limits expansion by degrading brassoster makes testable predictions: loss of C50 activity lengthens styles, S-m styles contain less brassoster than-m, and expansion of-m styles is rescued by brassoster. Assayed C genotype in seven longyles with independent origins. Classic predict longyles via recombination in S affecting G and linked female-compatibility, hence self-compatible, but self-in longyles only G affected or recombination. Indeed, Primula Aleitia C50 present in S, not-m of heteryl P frond and P farosa, and not long Pscica and Paller. In Primula Prim C50 present S, not-m of heter P elior and jul, and not Pgrand. Naturally longyles P vulgar contained C50, but not-m. Quantitative PCR on RNA styles indicated reduced C expression in longyles compared S-m. Newly longyles P vulgar and P xuhiana contained exon-deletion of C50. Virus-induced silencing downregulated C in P, resulting in longer styles. Overexpressing C in tobacco reduced growth, likely due to sequence divergence. Combined evidence indicates C50 represents G in Prim heterly super, expression in-m causes brassoster degradation, limiting expansion, and elongation. Evolutionary C50 arose specific duplication and gain expression in ancestor Primaceae likely dominant-short mutation.
High-frequency stimulation of Kiss1 neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (AR) releases neurokinin B (NKB) that depolarizes and recruits other Kiss1 neurons. Dynorphin is co-released and acts presynaptically to modulate (inhibit) the release of N. Together, the two peptides govern synchronous activity of Kiss1 neurons and promote kisspein release that stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the median eminence. Kiss1 neurons also communicate with the anteroventralivular and periventric preoptic (AV/Pe) neurons via the neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing AVPe neurons. Activation of rostral AVPe releases kisspein to robustly excite Gn neurons via the G54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating release at the time of preovulatory. Kisspein, G54, N, KB, Tac3, and RH are required for normal fertility.

The study used primarily female mice, with a few male mice used for pharmacological analysis. All procedures were conducted at Oregon Health Science University (OHS) according to the National Institutes Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals with approval from OHS Animal and Use Committee. Kiss-CG mice were used for viral expression of Ch2 in AR or AV/Pe neurons, crossed with heterozygous Ai mice carrying the Ch2 (134)EY gene in Gt ROS locus. The gene was separated from C promoter by lox-flanked transcription cassette, allowing expression in Cre-dependent. Kiss-C mice expressed Ch2 ectopically in many cells, not used for experiments. Other Ai mice exhibited EFP in expected locations AR and AV/Pe, used for experiments. Some Kiss-C::Gn-EG, Ag-C, and PC mice were produced by breeding Kiss-CG with Gn-EG transgenic and Ag or PC mice with Ai, respectively. Fourteen to twenty days prior experiments, Kiss-CG or Kiss::nEG mice received bilateral or unilateral AR or AV injections of Cre-dependent adeno viral vector encoding Ch-merry, Ch-Y, or Y alone. Anesthetized mice received medial incision to expose skull, pipette filled with oil, loaded with aliquot A using Nanoject. AR coordinates were anteroposterior -1.20, mediateral ±0.30, dorventral -5.80; AV injection were 0.53, ±0.30, -4.70-5.10. 500 of A (2 x 101 particles) was injected 100min into each position, left for 10 post-injection, then pip removed. Skin was closed with adhesive, each received analgesia Rimyl 4mg for two post. Females used gonads or ovariectomized (OV). OV exhibit increased Gn and pulsatile secretion with expression neurope, including kissin, N, and dynin AR1. Since interested in mechanism AR synchronize pulsatile Gn and LH, used OV females. Also used intact females different estrous stages to compare high-frequency response to OV. For AV/Pe and Gn neurons, used OV treated E as model proest stage. Seven prior oectomies performed under inhal isoforane. Caren Rimyl given after surgery 4mg for post.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and favoring mesodermal differentiation over neural differentiation in pluripotent cells. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Research has shown that BMP maintains pluripotency by upregulating Inhibitor of Differentiation (Id) factors, which act as dominant inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) transcription factors, preventing neural differentiation. Id is expressed in the pluripotent epib and not restricted to the primitive streak or differentiating meserm. BMP also upregulates the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin (Cdh) in pluripotent cells, which is downregulated during early neural differentiation. Downregulation of Cdh is associated with epithelial-mesym transition (EMT) and the formation of meserm at the primitive streak and emergence of neural cells from the neural tube. The formation of the neural from epib does not bear the hallmarks of classical EM, but is accompanied by loss of Cdh and gain of N-cadher (dh) and viment. Research has shown that EM is required for overtod differentiation, and downregulation of Cdh is a limiting for neural differentiation. BMP signaling contributes to maintenance of plurotency, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. It is proposed that BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining Cdh expression. Suppression of Cdh is sufficient to rescue the BMP-imposed block to multiline differentiation. Id, the target of BMP, imposes a posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards meserm. The ability of Id to block differentiation is unlikely explained by inhibition of a neural-inducing factor or activation of mesermal differentiation, but a shift in positional of plurotent cells. This may explain why no Id-regulated-neural bHL transcription has been found. Id null cells have a defect in maintenance plurot, consistent with finding Id delays an epib-like state. The effects of BMP, maintaining C and imposing posterior, can be uncoupled by varying dose. Lower doses maintain C and suppress fate, but insufficient impose stable identity. Suppression C at lower doses is sufficient to rescue differentiation, indicating primary mechanism inhibiting neural in this context is controlling Cadher activity. This highlights importance of adhesion and tissue in receptivity to differentiation cues. Cdh influences factor recept of ES and stabilizes plurotent states. BMP maintains Cdh expression during differentiation. Id is excluded anterior in vivo, may play role regulating EM in early. BMP signals from ectoderm block neural and required for meserm formation, but also necessary maintenance plurot. Embryos in BMP overactivated have impairment mes differentiation, not explained by models driving meserm. This unites observations showing BMP prime mes fate by imposing posterior, restrain from overtod by EM. Antagonism BMP induces anterior-posterior axis, proposed stimulating mediol intercal caud progenitors, preserving reservoir throughout elongation. Similar mechanism during plurotent cells, preserving undifferentiated by preventing loss C. Mechanism controlling EM will be interesting study, connected antagon Nodal, required EM at primitive.

A novel centriole-associated protein, C120, plays a critical role in regulating centri maturation in quiescent cells. Depletion of C120 in mouse and human cells leads to accumulation of pericentri material, including pericentr, C5ap2, nine, and C170, and increased microtub nucleation at the centros. This results in aberrant dyin-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centri satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. C120 helps maintain centros homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centole. Loss of C120 is associated with ciliopathies such as Jeune Thoracic Dystrophy and Joub syndrome. The centros is the major microtub-organizing center in animal cells, regulating the assembly of the inter microtub array and mitotic spindle. In qucent cells, the cent is composed of a pair of centoles surrounded by perentri material, involved in microub nucleation and anchoring. The two centoles differ in age and structure, with the older one assembled two cycles ago called the mother centole and the younger one assembled in the previous cycle the daughter centole. Most activities at the cent are regulated by the motherole. C120 is a centomal protein preferentially enriched on the daughterole, and its localization is coincident with procentole assembly in S-phase. Depletion of C120 disrupts procentole formation in S-phase cycling and nascent assembly multicells. Subsequent studies defined the role of C in molecular pathways regulating procentole assembly. Mutations in C were identified in patients with cili phenotypes, highlighting its critical role in centri-centomeilia biology. To address the question of C enrichment on the daughterole in qucence, an assay was established to deplete C while arresting cells in G0 and maintaining quence. Loss of C disrupts procentole in S, resulting in cells lacking centoles after few divisions. To overcome this, siRNA oligos were used to specifically deplete C. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were seeded at high density, transfected with control or C-specific siRNA, and incubated in low-medium for 24-48 to arrest in G0. Immunob analysis of whole lysates showed near depletion of C. Consistent with this, endogenous C signal was lost from the daughterole, evidenced by immunofluorescence. The proportion of cells in each phase of the cycle was analyzed by FACS to ensure C-depleted cells were in G0. Both control and C-de M showed an increase in G-G population upon serum-starvation, with no difference in cycle profiles. Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was lost in both control and C-de cells upon serum removal. Cells were immunostained for Ki-67, and the fraction of positive cells determined. The results indicate C-de cells are arrested in G. The abundance of asymmetrically localized proteins at the centome was measured using single-cell immunofluorescence microscopy. Perentr is a scaffolding that attaches the centolar microtules and forms the foundation for other components to assemble. In control cells, perentr was preferentially on the motherole. Depletion of C resulted in a 2.5-fold increase total centomal perentr, with most on the daughterole. C5ap is recruited by perentr to form the matrix, and was enriched on the mother. Loss C caused a 6-fold increase total C5ap levels, with most on the daughter. Nine is PCM that localizes to proximal centoles and subdist appendages of the mother, and was enriched on the. Depletion resulted in greater than 4-fold centomal nine, with increase on the daughter. C170 is PCM that localizes to proximal centoles and subdist append of the mother, and
In this study, researchers investigated the communication between neurons and Müller glial cells (MC) in the developing retina. They found that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MC, demonstrating spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. Physiological results indicate MCs express multiple neurotransmitter types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC to be sustained as synchronization from cholinergic to glutamgic signaling. The proportion of MC that responded waves decreased significantly from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves. Age-dependent decline MC during ret waves caused by glutamate expression increase, restricting spillo from nearby synapses activation of AMPAR. Data indicate MCs in retina use multiple pathways participate in spontaneous, correlated with neurons during crucial ret development. Different mechanisms have been implicated inducing trans in astrocytes throughout peripheral and central nervous system. Robust mechanisms vary, even synapses, age, preparation, and arousal. Data indicate MC prior eye capable responding different neurotrans increases intracellular. Neurotrans-evoked trans observed stalks lateral MC during synaptogenesis.

A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using microbial communities to estimate postmortem interval (PM) in a mouse model. Mice were allowed to decompose on soil in a controlled environment, and samples were destructively sampled at eight time points over 48 days. Microbial communities were characterized using high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18 rRNA genes. Results showed significant changes in bacterial and eukotic communities over time, with shifts in abundance of specific taxa corresponding to stages of decomposition. Bacterial communities became more aerobic after rupture, while eukotic communities became dominated by nemat Osche tipula. Regression analysis using Random Forest model estimated PMI with an average absolute error of 3.30 ± 2.52 days. Combining 16 and 18 datasets resulted in best estimates of PM, although improvement was not significant. Taxa in Rhobiales and Osche were most predictive for bacterial and eukotic communities, respectively. Analysis using small numbers of highly predictive taxa showed 5-10 taxa provided similar accuracy to models with all taxa. The study demonstrated potential for microbial ecology of decomposing corpses to be a complementary forensic tool for estimating PM, with advantages of rapid DNA sequencing and ease of sampling. However, factors such as environmental conditions, edaphic variation, and human microbiome differences remain to be established. Future studies are crucial to understand relationship between decomposition, postmort microbial communities, and environmental parameters such as temperature, moisture, soil type, and texture.
Molecular insights into the origin of the Hox patterning system in bilaterian animals reveal that the Hox genes, which define the anterior-posterior axis, interact with TALE (Three Amino acid loop extension) proteins. Hox and TALE are present in bilater phyla, but not in all non-bilater phyla, raising the question of how H-T interactions evolved to provide positional information. Using unicellular and multicellular lineages, it is shown that H-T networks emerged from an ancestral motif present in Hox and related proteins. H-T networks experienced additional innovations crucial for differentiating H functions along body plans. The study highlights how homeobox families evolved during eukary evolution to constitute a pattering system in metazoans.

The Hox genes are highly conserved in bilater animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. However, their role is ambiguous outside Bilateria, particularly in the Cnidaria group. Cnidarians contain H genes, but have a wide morphological radiation evolution, and H genes do not have clear collinear conserved profile along primary oralabor axis. The role of H in Cnid is difficult to assign, especially for posterior-anterior H genes. Cnid is the only nonilater phylum with a bonaide H repertoire, while others lack H genes. This raises the question of how H acquired axial patter functions during metazo evolution.

Bilateria H patter relies on P and Me proteins, which are present in unicellular Ambozo and metazo. Analysis of Nostella, a cnid species, shows H and T proteins form networks similar to bilater counterparts. Nost H and T display anterior or central DNA-binding preferences, and rescue Drosila H-mut tricereum structure. In-silico data and expression of H and T in Nost embryo suggest H-T interaction regulates gene expression in enderm, specifying mesies along directive axis. Homology between Cnid and bilian axes is controversial, with oralabor Nost possibly orthologous to bilian AP axis. Expression of H genes in Nost corresponds to individual and positional functions, not patterning. Other determinants play patter roles, such as Six factors in aboral specification.

The H-T system is an ancestral module co-opted by various contexts in eumazo phyla for patterning, illustrating adaptability throughout evolution. T proteins are present in plants, fungi, and metazoa, interacting with each other or other and other families. H-T interaction is an ancient feature in eary, present in Eumaz ancestor before CnidBil split. Ac, a unicellular organism, shows no interaction between T or with H proteins, highlighting P-Me partnership critical for H-T networks. H is conserved in H, NK, and extendedox, but role and importance may differ. H, NK, and extendedox have sub-specializations, possibly from divergent interaction T cofactors. Me reveals specific P motifs in H, distinguishing functions between paralog.
Super-resolution microscopy was used to study the dynamics of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at synapses in cultured hippocamp neurons. AMPARs were labeled with fluorescent probes of different sizes, including quantum dots (QDs) and organic dyes. The results showed that most AMPs were localized to synapses, with a small pool of extrasynaptic AMPs. Previous studies using bD-tagged AMPs suggested a large pool of extrasyn AMPs due to limited slots in PSDs, but this was not observed with smaller probes. The number of AMPs in PSD was not limited by slots, but by exocyt rate, endyt rate, or extracellular matrix (ECM) regulating membrane diffusion. Chromatic aberration was corrected using a nanohole pattern on a silver-coated coverslip, with an error of 2 nm. Fiduci markers were used to correct stage drift, with an error of 1 nm in x and 15 nm z. Hippocamp cultures were prepared from E18 rats, co-transfected with Homer1-mos and Glu2-AP, and imaged at 12-13 DIV. ECM was removed using hyuronase, and AMPs labeled with Alexa NHS-conjugated anti-Glu2. Streptavidin homologs were engineered to improve dissociation kinetics by blocking solvent entry into the binding pocket, with a 37-fold decrease in dissociation rate. SA-qdots were tested for cross-linking, with normal streptin conjugating multiple biotins, while moneric strein did not. The run of kines of SA-q was the same as single kines, indicating no cross-linking. PALM and STORM were used for super-resolution of postyn density and AMP/NMD receptor tracking, with a localization precision of 11-21 nm for organicyes and 9.6 nm for Qdots. Trajectories were calculated using Matlab, with a maximum displacement of 1 μm, and diffusion coefficients calculated by fitting the first 4 points of mean-displacement curve. Synaptic trajectories were identified within 2 μ of synapses, with an average distance smaller than 0.55 μ. Visualizations were created using VMD 1.9.2.
SUMylation of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na1.2 (NaV1.2) at the plasma membrane underlies the increase in sodium current (IN) in response to acute hypoxia in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. SUMylation of Na1.2 channels is mediated by the small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO) enzyme, which conjugates to the epsilon-amino group of lysine 38 (Lys38) on the Na1.2 subunit. SUMylation of Na1.2 channels increases IN by shifting the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation, allowing depolarizing steps to evoke larger sodium currents. The SUMylation of Na1.2 is rapid, occurring within 40 seconds, and is prevented by mutation of Lys38 to glutamine (L38Q) or application of the deSUMylating enzyme SENP1. The SUMylation of Na1.2 is specific to L38, as other lysines on the Na.1 subunit or beta subunit are not SUMylated. SUMylation of Na.2 is not observed in cells expressing Na1.2-L38Q channels or in the presence of SENP. The time course of SUMylation of L38 matches the increase in Na. current observed in CHO cells subjected to hypia. SUMylation of Na.2 is observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TX), indicating Na+ flux is not required for channel SUMylation. The SUMylation of Na. is a potential therapeutic target for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons.
Researchers developed a mechanistic model for the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), a mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to understand the role of temperature in disease dynamics and responses to climate change. They found that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines at high and low temperatures, with thermal optima and limits unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. The model accurately predicts year-round transmission in the tropics and seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in nationwide seasonal peaks in human cases. Climate warming will increase transmission in temperate areas where most Australians live but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are near the thermal optimum.

The history of RRV is complex, with transmission across various climates, habitats, and vertebrate reservoirs, and vectors. Mars are critical for maintaining the virus between outbreaks, but recent work suggests placental and birds may be important in some locations. The virus has been isolated in over 40 mosquito species, with four responsible for transmission to humans: Culex annirostr, Aedes vigil, Ae notscript, and Ae camorhynch, and two implicated in outbreaks. Vectors differ in climate and habitats, leading to geographic variation in associations.

The researchers assembled records of R outbreaks attributed to different vectors and mapped them (Figure 1). Ae vigil and notscript were more implicated in tropical and subtropical, Ae camorynch in temperate, and Cxulstr in allatic. Freshwater Cxstr has been implicated in inland and coastal areas, while salt Ae vigil and camor in coastal areas affected by salin agriculture. Per-domestic Ae notscript has been implicated in urban epidemics. Vectors also differ in seasonality: camor peaks earlier in cooler temperatures than vigil, leading to seasonal succession.

The researchers built a mechanistic model (R Model) assuming temperature drives mosquito density and life trait responses. They compared it to a constant model where density does not depend on temperature. The R peaked at 26.4°C and was positive from 17.0-31.5°C. Removing temperature dependence did not affect the peak, but the range of temperatures was larger when density did not depend on temperature. The thermal constraints mosquito imposes are important, as traits vary with temperature in laboratory but many models assume not.

The optimal temperature for RRV (26-27°C) fits the range found for other diseases: malaria by Anophe spp at 25°C and deng and viruses by Ae aegi and albict at 29 and 26. The upper limit was constrained by fecity and adult, while the lower by fecity, larval, survival, and egg viability. The thermal responses were limited by traits with data, with priors used to represent uncertainty. Sensitivity analyses showed the impact of traits on thermal responses and partial derivatives of R with respect to traits.

The researchers applied the model to Australia, using monthly temperatures from Worldlim, and calculated median R for each location. They compared seasonality of population-weighted R and aggregated cases. The model predicted a two-month lag between temperature and cases. The mapped R across Australia, showing months for R >0 and >0.5 for the median, 2.5, and 97.5% bounds. The results illustrate the importance of temperature in R dynamics and responses to climate.
Three malehes macaques (Macaca mul) were chronically implanted with arrays of Tef-coated tungsten microw electrodes in the upper arm of primary cortex (M) and dorsal premotor (PM) to record local field potentials (LFP) and single-unit activity. They performed center-out (CO) and neuro-reaching (NR) tasks. In CO, they moved their hand from a central target to a peripheral target over a 13 cm circle. In NR, they performed neurofeedback followed by an arm to a target. A beta cursor represented motor power and four targets appeared on the screen. Subjects modulated endogenous signals to make the cursor hover the target for 450 ms to end the neuroepoch. The cursor and target disappeared, and a peripheral target appeared 6.5 cm away. The cursor was designed to reflect endogenous oscillatory events. LFP from three channels were selected for each subject, with minimal artifacts and strong oscillatory activity during reaching. Channels were consistent throughout NR tasks. Beta and broadband power were estimated using the multi-taper method with five tapers. Normalized beta was computed by dividing beta power by broadband. A subject-specific transform mapped beta to a vertical position. A two-step moving average filter smoothed the cursor position. Normalized values to modulate the middle of each target were finalized after ~ week training. Monkey performed a variant with 1-10 power in addition to beta. Four targets were in the same locations. The task required producing correct power without extreme 1-10 modulations. Subjects practiced with lenient requirements, which were made harder until performance plateaued. The values 1-10 power must within 0.74-0.95 for each session, lasting 10-40 min. A target-shuffled simulation assessed performance during the neuroepoch. The simulation had an average-reaching, constant time, and inter-trial interval. Mean and standard deviation were calculated, and z-scored actual trials. Resultant z-scores were plotted for each session. Movement onset was computed by projecting cursor velocity onto a unit from center to peripheral. The norm yielded a time series of speed. The index of maximum speed was computed, and scanned backwards until below 20% of peak speed. Time was called movement onset. Cuz's test assessed ordering of metrics according to four target. A statistic was calculated for the hypothesis groups follow ordering. Z follows a standard distribution, so p-value calculated. Trials were relabeled spectral to simulate onset analysis. Subplots contained all trials, assigned labels according to quartile power. Cuz's test was performed. Population analysis was conducted with monkeys G and C. Units were sorted using Plex Offline. Single and multi were included. Analyses were within day to prevent day-day instability. Units exhibited same firing during neuro-induced or naturally occurring oscillations. Spiking was binned 100 ms. Counts during NR and CO were compared. Mann-Whitney assessed differences. Percentage cells exhibited significant. Beta-to-spike mapping was estimated for each task. Rewarded and NR trials were extracted 1.5 prior to go to 1.0 after go. Spiking was binned 1 ms yielding vectors. Concatenated a matrix for each task. Beta was estimated using a fifth Butter bandpass and Hilbert. Vectors reordered by amplitude and spiking reordered. Linear was fit to ordered pairs. Intra-task and inter stability was assessed. Two non-overlapping segments were used. Slopes were plotted. Monkey had limited CO data, so a subset was used. Stable correlations were used. A logistic classifier was trained spiking to discriminate pre-movement and post-movement. Trials were extracted 1.5 prior to 1.0 go yielding 2.5-long. Spiking was binned 25 yielding a matrix for each task and day. Each unit was zd by mean and standard. Chunks were concatenated. Each was labeled pre-m
TRAF2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in TNF signaling, but its function is not fully understood. Studies have shown that loss of TR2 delays or reduces TN-induced NF-κ and JNK and protects cells from TN-induced death, but the mechanism is unclear. TR2 has a RING domain, which is atypical and unable to recruit E ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, but may require a lipid cofactor, S1, to function as an E3 ligase. However, this is problematic as SP1 is not essential for TN-induced TR2-dependent NF-κ. TR2 is required for TN signaling in some cells, such as macrophages and keratinocytes, but not in others, like macrophages. TR2 has a role in tissue homeostasis, with 3-week-old TR- mice developing colitis due to colonic epithelium death. Keratin-specific TR2 knockout mice develop epider hyperplasia and skin inflammation, with lesions around the head and submental area by 6 weeks. Loss of TR2 causes constitutive non-canonical NFκ activation in keratinocytes, which increases inflammatory cytokine production. Deletion of TN and TR2 rescues the skin in TR2KO mice, indicating TN-dependent death is a driver of inflammation. Constitutive non-can NFκ is a driver of inflammation in epithelial cells, relevant to human psoriasis as TWE/F14 is elevated in psatic lesions and induces TR2 activation. Inhibition of non-can NF may be beneficial in chronic disease with TN inhibitors.
A study investigated the mechanism of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling via bulkocytosis, a high-capacity pathway of plasma membrane internalization that predominates under intense neuronal activity. Dynamin 1 and dynamin 3, the two neuronal dynamin isoforms, were examined for their role in this process. Dynamin 1 knockout (KO) and dyn 3 knockout (KO) mice were used, as well as dyn 1 and 3 double knockout (1/3KO) mice. Neuronal cultures were stimulated with high K+ for 90 s to induce bulkocyt, and then allowed to recover in Ca2-free Tyro buffer or Tyro buffer with 1 M TTX to prevent synaptic activity. Bulkocyt was assessed with cholera toxin-horad peroxidase (CT-HRP) and soluble horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as endytic tracers. Results showed that bulkocyt was not impaired in dyn 1 KO and 3 KO synapses, but was enhanced in dyn 1 and 3 KO synapses. Conversion of bulkosomes to SVs was observed in all genotypes, but was delayed in dyn 1 and 3 syn. Clath heavy chain (CH) depletion did not further impair bulkosome conversion to SV in dyn 3 KO synapses. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis of high-frozen/freeze-substituted specimens revealed compact cytoplasm and different endytic structures induced by stimulation. Bulkosomes had electron-lcent lumens and rounded or oval profiles, with occasional buds on vacolar structures connected to the plasma membrane. CCPs were observed on plasma invaginations in dyn 3 KO synapses. Bulkosomes were tubulated and fragmented, suggesting progressive SV formation by fragmentation. Morphometric analysis showed a range of SV diameters, with a shift to larger diameters after stimulation and recovery. Beldin A and latrulin B treatments did not affect SV formation from bulkosomes. Overall, the study suggests a dyn 1 and 3-independent pathway for bulkocyt and conversion of bulkosomes to SV.
A clinical study aimed to identify biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action in humans using a randomized, crossover design with 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrinopathies. The study involved physiological GC exposure and withdrawal, and multi-omic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), adipose tissue, plasma microRNAs, and metabolites. A transcriptomic profile from PB and adipose tissues showed similar regulation under GC exposure, validated by comparison with published data from other research groups. A circulating miRNA, mi-122p, was correlated with transcriptome and metabolome, suggesting a functional role in GC action, and replicated in independent studies with different GC exposure. The study design accounted for diurnal variation in GC and food intake, minimizing confounders, and integrated multiomic layers to reduce background noise. A hypernetwork model of GC action was used to assess potential biomarkers, identifying genes, miRNAs, and metabolites differently expressed during GC exposure and withdrawal in subjects with Addison's disease. The multiomic data showed coherence, and network analysis identified transcript and metabolites correlated. A mi-122p was regulated by GC, correlated with genes and metabol regulated by GC, indicating functional relevance. Replication in independent groups increased likelihood of mi-122 as a biomarker of GC in clinical settings.
The article discusses the dynamics of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) activation in response to amino acids, specifically focusing on the spatiotemporal localization of mTOR and its dependence on amino presence. The study used RAP-GFP (green fluorescent protein) cells, which provide a tool to address this question in a near-physiological setting, showing absolute reliance on amino for mC activation and translocation to lysosomes. Translocation is a fast and transient event, peaking early and returning to baseline, while phosphorylation of substrates continues for some time. The presence of an amino analogue in lysosomal lumen induces translocation of R-GFP. The analogue, a diucine ester with fluorescent moiety, produces sustained translocation due to continuous accumulation in lysosomal lumen. This provides a dynamic view of mC activation in response to amino. Several sensors are involved, including cytosolic Sestr2, lysosomal ATPase, and macinocytosis, and topology involves cytos, lysosomal membrane, and lysosomal lumen. Import into lysosomes may depend on macinocytosis, but timing of translocation places restraint on trafficking steps. The speed of translocation eliminates potential routes of amino delivery to lysosomes. Import via canonical vesicular route is unlikely, given fluid delivery takes longer than 10 min, and translocation is within 2 min. Import into cytos via transporters or macinos may be fast, but an additional step is needed for lysosomal import. The fluorescent and diuc methyl ester argue all steps can be bypassed with activating moiety delivered to functional lysosomes. Macinocytosis activation is not seen with these compounds. An uncoupling between translocation and phosphorylation is observed, suggesting activated m may exist in cytos, not lysosomal surface. A target, 4EB-1, never accumulates on lysosomes. R, essential for m activation, localizes to ER/Gol endembrane, not lys. Disrupting Golgi localization with B has modest effect on m activity, little co-localizes with RC. This re-emphasizes lysosomal involvement in m signaling, but modifies existing model. Lysosomes may be platforms for interaction between mC and RC, but complex may come off membrane to phosphorylate substrates. Activated m free to move in cytos, consistent with known substrates ranging from cytomembrane to nuclear.
The study demonstrates that glycosylation of antigens influences antigen uptake and intracellular compartmentalization, affecting antigen presentation and immune response type and strength. Modification of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) with Le glycans directs O to the C-type lectin M1 (M1), skewing naive CD4+ T cell differentiation towards IFN-producing Th1 cells. M1-dependent cross-presentation occurs at low antigen doses, independently of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and does not involve TAP transporters or Cathepsin-S. M1 targeting antigen is routed to Rab11+AMP+ compartments, where it persists for prolonged periods, facilitating cross-presentation. The study highlights the importance of glycan composition in dictating intracellular routing, Th skewing, and immune response, suggesting its consideration in vaccine design against cancer and infectious diseases.
This study investigated the role of quorum sensing (QS) in Burkholderia thailandensis, a bacterium that uses acyl-hoser lactone-mediated QS to regulate hundreds of genes. The researchers found that QS activates cell-cell-dependent type VI (T) secretion (TSS) systems, which are involved in toxin-antitoxin immunity. They demonstrated that TSS is required to restrict the proliferation of QS mutants in cocultures of a B. thailand QS receptor mutant and its parent. However, the mutant is not constrained and outcompetes its parent in broth culture, presumably due to a metabolic cost associated with QS activation. The fitness of the wild type over the mutant during agar growth is dependent on an intact TSS apparatus. QS activates B. thailand TSS-1 growth inhibition and this serves to police QS mutants. This work defines a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control of QS mutants.

The study used RNAseq to identify genes in the B. thailand QS regulon and found that QS activates several genes encoding TSS substrates, including toxins and their cognate antitoxins. They showed that T provides the wild B. thensis with the ability to constrain QS mutants in a contact-dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that QS of toxin-antoxin systems can serve as policing to control QS among competent cells. The findings also reveal another role for T in bacteria, as it has been shown to provide interspecies or interstrain advantage and play a role in bacterial virulence.

To assess the fitness of B. th mutants in competition with its parent, the researchers cocultured the wild with signal QS mutants. They found that the mutant showed an increase from 1% to 50% of the population in broth, while the and mutants did not have a growth advantage. In agar cocultures, the mutant had no growth advantage over the parent. The researchers asked if QS controls contact-dependent growth systems and found that B. thensis contains five TSS, one of which is used for interspecies (T-1). T-1 comprises a pathway that delivers effector proteins to neighboring cells upon cell contact, some of which have been characterized as toxic. B.ensis is immune to toxins because it produces cognate proteins.

The study tested the hypothesis that QS activates T-1-mediated killing in B.ensis by competing the wild or signal mutants against a mutant lacking T1, t1, and adjacent paralogs. Consistent with previous findings, the wild outcompeted the effector and mutant. The mutant was impaired in inhibition of the eff and mutant. The and mutants showed wild-type inhibition. The researchers propose that T- mediated defect in the mutant results from inability to fully activate one or more T genes. They hypothesized that QS-activated T- effector and immunity in wild bacteria restrict proliferation of mutants upon contact in cocult. This was tested in agar experiments with T- secretion mutant and mutant. The mutant rose in frequency from 1 to 25% of population. When complemented with to restore T function, the mutant no longer conferred coc growth advantage. In coculture, the mutant showed strong advantage growth with mutant.
This study investigated the role of glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus in the emergence of prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice. The researchers selectively optogenetically manipulated glutamaterg projection in CA1 of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefront oscillatory entrainment. They found that despite stronger theta and ripples in dorsal hippocampus, prefront cortex was mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippoc by phase-locking of neuronal firing via direct axonal projections. Theta-band activation of pyram neurons in intermediate/vent but not dorsal CA1 transfected with high-efficiency channelrhopsin boosted prefront oscillations. The data causally elucidated the cellular origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain.

 The study also examined the oscillatory and firing of CA1 in dorsal and intermediatevent hippocampus in neon mice and found differences in properties and spectral structure. Theta bursts in intermediatevent had higher occurrence, larger amplitude, and shorter duration compared to dorsal. Pyramidal neurons in intermediatevent fired at higher rates than dorsal. Sharp-waves and ripples were more prominent in dorsal. The study then investigated the coupling of dorsal and intermediatevent hippocampus with prefrontal cortex and found stronger coherence and directed flow from intermediatevent to prefrontal. Firing of prefront neurons was precisely timed by phase of oscillations in intermediatevent but not dorsal.

 The researchers used optogenetic manipulation to selectively activate pyram neurons in CA1 of dorsal or intermediatevent hippoc and found that activation of intermediatevent at 8 Hz, but not 4 or 16 Hz, caused significant augmentation of oscillatory activity in prefrontal cortex. In contrast, activation of dorsal did not affect prefront activity. The study also found that silencing interneurons in intermediatevent with archerhodin reduced oscillatory activity in intermediate and prefront, while silencing interne in dorsal increased oscillatory in both. These results reveal the critical role of hippocal activity in oscillatory entrainment of prefrontal and pyram neurons in CA1 of intermediatevent but not dorsal as drivers of activation.

 The study also discussed the differences between dorsal and intermediate hippocampus in adults, with dorsal involved in spatial navigation and intermediate in non-spatial processing. The study found similar differences in oscillatory patterns between dorsal and intermediate hippoc in neonates, with dorsal having higher theta power and intermediate having more sharpaves and ripples. The study proposed that differences result from distinct innervation and intrinsic properties of hippocal neurons.
In this study, researchers investigated the post-translational modifications of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. They identified mono- and di-methylation of lysine (K) residues at position 7 (K7) of the CTD in mouse and human cells, as well as invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Mouse cell lines with K-to-S substitutions showed that multiple K residues are simultaneously methylated, including a single K residue at position 35 of the murine CTD. Conservation of C-K methylation and expansion in number of methylated K residues from vertebrates to mammals suggests functional relevance across taxa. Model organisms with K expansion, such as Plasium parasites, support studying the extent of K modifications at RNAPI C. They found that C-K methylation and acylation are associated with early stages of transcription, refractory to CD9 inhibition flavirid, and distributed in discrete foci in the nucleoplasm of cells. Genome-wide occupancy of Kme and K2 in ES cells showed they are highly enriched at promoters of active genes. C-K methylation levels correlated with promoter of unmodified serine (S), serine (S), and serine (S), but uncoupled from expression and serine (S) abundance. In contrast, they found C acylation downstream of regions into bodies and correlated with serine (S) and expression. An interesting aspect of studying C methylation and acylation is that two marks compete for available K residues at C and regulate expression. Observed ratio of Kme to Kac at active promoters inversely correlates gene expression. Genes with promoter occupancy RNAPI but have higher Kme relative Kac are less expressed than those with higher Kac Kme. This suggests balance K fine-tunes expression. Further studies are required to explore enzymatic activities that methylate and demethylate C-K residues, as well as readers of modified C-K. They performed co-immoprecipitation of Y-tagged RNAPI with wild-type C or C bearing K-S mutations, followed by mass spectrometry, but failed to identify modifiers and readers (data not shown), suggesting interactions RNAPI with C-K modifiers and/or readers may be transient in vitro approaches. Identification of modified C-K residues (Kme, Kme, Kme, Kac) expands repertoire of C interactors containing domains that recognize marks, such as PH finger, bromo, chromo, tudor, and MB-domains. Cross-talk between K modification and other C, such as phosphorylation, may regulate extent factor. Investigations of C code should consider contribution K to transcriptional regulation development and disease. Mouse ES line OS was grown on 0.1 gel-coated in GM-B21 supplemented with 10 calf serum, 2 L-glamine, 1 MEM- amino acids, 1 pyruvate, 50 β-mercaptoanol (Gibco, Invrogen;alth, MA), 100 U leuka inhibitory (Chem, Millip;Germany) and 0.1 Hygycin (Ro;Switzerland), described (Bill et al, 200; Niwa et,200). For CD9 inhibition and S phosphorylation, ES were treated 1hr with 10M flavirid prior protein (Stock et,200); 50 stock in dimethylfox (DO; a gift San-Avent, by Synthesis and Branch Development Therapeutic, Cancer Diagnosis, Bethesda, MD). For deacetyl inhibition, ES were treated 50M, 3hr; western blotting H9 confirmed deetyl inhibition (not shown). For P acetyl inhibition, ES were 3h with 30M646 (Sigma #ML2;Germany) prior protein.
Post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in maintaining the quiescent state of skeletal muscle stem cells (SCs). The T11 family of RNA-binding proteins, including Tristetrol (T), is involved in this process. T is a target of the p38/β MAPK pathway, which is activated upon muscle injury, leading to its phosphorylation and inactivation. Phospho-T no longer suppresses activation-associated transcripts, resulting in rapid SC activation. One such transcript targeted by T is Myo, which is induced due to inactivation of T by p38/β MAP concurrent with increased MyD mRNA stability by Hu and transcriptional upregulation of the MyD locus. MyD upregulates its own transcription, triggering a rapid-forward loop in MyD expression driving SC to myoblast. T may also be involved in downregulation of MyD and other T-targeted transcripts by mylast during initial qucent formation or reacquisition following injury. Gene analysis of uninjured and injured muscle SCs identified a cohort of transcripts downregulated upon activation prior cell entry, including those encoding mRNA-binding proteins involved in muscle diseases. T was the most downregulated, suggesting a critical role in postcriptional regulation of muscle homeostasis. The p/β MAP pathway is involved in SC activation, asymmetric division, and loss during aging, making it a mediator of these processes. T targets likely include positive regulators of myogenic, such as Hu, which stabilizes My and Myogen transcripts in myogenic lines. However, T does not regulate Hu during activation, and Hu is induced upon activation, suggesting multiple postcription pathways regulate myogenic factors like MyD and My5. MyD is a candidate for postcription regulation, present at low levels in freshly isolated SC, induced within 3 hours of activation, and requires p/β MAP activity. SC from aged mice commit to myogenesis with reduced selfnew, consistent with elevated pβ MAP activity. T likely regulates other mRNAs with AU-rich involved in qucence, and T11 members Br1 and Br2 are also downregulated upon activation. T knockdown in unin muscle increases My+ cells, at expense of Pax+ progenitors, accompanied by m+ myib. T breaks qucence, providing evidence for involvement in homeasis. Postcription of mRN by mi-489 maintains qucence, suggesting Dek and other mi489 regulate homeasis. The diversity within Pax+ population is possible, and experiments will resolve whether qu is coordinately regulated by multiple mechanisms or subsets uniquely responsive distinct muscle or requirements.
Macrophage dysfunction initiates colitis during weaning of infant mice lacking the interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10). IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production in both innate and adaptive immune cells. Mice deficient in IL-10 or its receptor (IL-10R) develop early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To understand the role of IL-10 in infant development, researchers studied IL-10-deficient mice and their littermate controls from birth to 14 weeks. They found no signs of inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice less than 14 days old, but IL-10 is required to prevent intestinal inflammation that emerges during the third week of life. The onset of inflammation in 3-week-old IL-10-deficient mice was associated with increased numbers of lamina propria macrophages (LPΦ) and inversion of the ratio of newly recruited P1/P2Φ and resident P3Φ populations. Resident PΦ typically exhibit an anti-inflammatory phenotype, but RNA sequencing indicated the anti-inflammatory phenotype of IL-10-def LPΦ was compromised at onset, suggesting altered Φ had a causative role in initiating inflammatory. In contrast, significant alterations in effector cell populations were not observed. Clodate-mediated depletion of Φ inhibited colitis, and lack of IL-10α on Φ led to development of colitis in 3-4-week C57/BL6 Cd1 congenic mice. Antibiotics suppressed inflammation in 3-4-week IL-10-deficient mice, but IL-10 did not regulate microbiota composition during infancy. The study suggests IL-10 signaling on Φ is pivotal in confining microbiota-driven response beginning the third of life, with alterations in LP anti-inflammatory Φ a key event initiating inflammatory.
The Tudor domain protein SIM-1 (SIM-1) plays a crucial role in the piRNA pathway in Caenorhabdis elegans. SIM-1 is required for the production of secondary siRNAs from pi-targeted mRNAs by the mutator complex. SIM-1 localizes to cytoplasmic foci near granules, granules, and Mutator foci, implicating distinct perin condensates in the regulation of mRN by the pi pathway and mut complex. The Tud domain of SIM-1 is necessary for its localization to these foci, and a mutation in the Tud domain disrupts SIM- localization. SIM-1 is not required for PR-1 localization or expression, and PR- is not required SIM- localization. SIM- and PR- function in the same pathway to mediate si biogenesis at pi-target mRN. The Tud domain of SIM- is similar to other Tudor domains in Drosophila and mammals, suggesting a conserved function. SIM- is not required for exogenous RNA, but is necessary for siRNA production at pi-target mRN. SIM- mutants are sterile at elevated temperature, but fertility recovers at 20°C. The sterility is not due to loss of siRN from loci after 10 generations. pi-target genes become depleted of smallRN after 10 generations at 25, but not in fertile pr- mutants. Mut-target genes, pi-target, and ER-1-target are reduced in mut- and pr- mutants. PR- independent mut-targets are a subset of mut-targets with unchanged or increased small in pr-. CSR- targets, AL-4, spermat, and oogen are enriched. SIM- upregulates histone genes. SIM- is not required for PR- expression or localization, and PR is not required SIM localization. SIM and PR function in same to mediate si at pi-target m. Tud of SIM is similar to Tud in Doph and mammals, suggesting conserved. SIM not for exogenous, but necessary si at pi-target. Mutants sterile elevated, fertility recovers 20. Sterility not loss si loci after 10. Pi-target depleted after 10 25, not pr. Mut-target, pi-target, ER- reduced mut, pr. PR independent mut subset of mut unchanged or increased. CSR, AL, sper, oogen enriched SIM up histone.
Title: AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic excitation drives bistability in Purkin neurons of larval zebraf

Purkin neurons are central to cerebellar function and exhibit bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia. However, the existence of bistability in awake animals is disputed. This study records intracellularly from Purkin neurons in unanesthetized larval zraf (Danio rerio) and unequivocally demonstrates bistability in these neurons. Tonic firing was seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Purkin neurons could switch between states spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NAR were not required for bursting, but activation of AMPs by climbing fibers (CFs) was sufficient to trigger. By recording Purkin neuron potential intracellular and motor spikes extracellular, initiation is correlated with increased incidence of CFEPs and depolarization. Developmentally, bistability observed soon after Purkin neuron specification and persists until late larval stages.

Purkin neurons have fascinated neuroscientists due to their elaborate dendritic arbors (Ramón Cajal, 1911) and high spontaneous activity in vitro (Lás and Sugori,1980; R and Bell,2003) and in vivo (Armstrong et al,197; Kitamura Häser,201). As the sole output of cerebellar, firing patterns of Purkin are functionally significant for motor coordination and learning (Thach,196; Medina201; Yang Lisberger,201; Hewitt,201). Mammalian Purkin exhibit bist in vitro (Lás and Sugori,198; Oldfield,201) and in vivo anesthesia (Loenstein et al,200; Schewille et al,200), but existence in awake has been debated (Schew et al,200; Yse et al,200; Eng,201). Zraf are a model for studying intracellular dynamics of Purkin using whole patch recording in vivo in simple behaviors. Cerebell of zraf has three parts: corpusbell (CC), valulacerebell (Va), and vestibulolobe subdivided into eminentia granis and lobus caudacerebell (ae et al,200; Hibi Shimizu,201). Only CC and Va show layered architecture (Hashimoto H,201). Purkin in CC receive excitatory inputs from parallel (PFs) and CFs and inhibition from stell cells (Figure 1).kin in zraf have planar dendritic arb decorated with spines (Miy and Nakasu,200) but unlike mammals, do not project deeper but to effer cells whose somata in Purkin layer or ventral (ae et,200; Take et,201). Effer cells, called euryend cells, receive axons from Pur and send outside cerebell (ae et,200; Heap et,201; Take,201). Zein (aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase) expressed in Purkin zraf (Miy Nakasu200; ae,200) but in mammals only subset (Dor et,199; Chu et,199; Leerc et,199; Sito et,200) and birds (P et,200; I et,200; Cor et,201; Vibase et,201).

The study recorded Purkin neurons in lar zraf from 4 to 19 days postfertilization (dp). At 4dp, spontaneous activity indistinguishable from 7dp, both bursting and tonic Purkin present. CFEPs, sodium spikes, and calcium spikes present at 4dp, 7, and 19dp. Tonic and bursting cells mode-switch by hyperpolar and depolar, respectively. At 19dp, fewer CFs compared to 4dp and 7dp. Recorded CFSC in voltage mode
A multiscale model of actin in mammalian clath-mediated endocytosis (CME) was developed by combining continuum mechanics of the plasma membrane with filament-based simulations of actin polymerization. The model consists of two modules: a continuum mechanics of the membrane and an agent-based model of actin and associated proteins. Iterative simulations were run in each module, with results from one informing assumptions of the other. Experiments focused on internalization of the U-shaped pit and its transition to omega shape for both membrane and act modules. The continuum mechanics informed the initial shape and force/extension for act module, while the act module informed location of act forces for the membrane model. The model shows that a minimal actin network composed of act, Arp2/3, and capping, with attachments in the clath coat, is sufficient to generate force internal endocytic pits against mammalian membrane tension. Approximately 200 Ar2 complexes assemble at endoc sites in human pluripotent cells. Endytic act filaments self-organize into a dendritic array, growing toward the base of the pit, bending and storing elastic energy. The network adapts to changes in membrane tension by driving filaments to the base and increasing bending, supporting higher load. Four lines of evidence support the model: two based on published data, two on conducted in this study. Experiments showed knocking down HipR in HeLa cells inhibited endyt, consistent with simulations showing a threshold of act linkers necessary for endytic internal. Experiments capping actin elongation with Cytochal inhibited C, consistent with simulations increasing capping inhibiting endytic. Cryo-elect tomography observed bent filaments at endytic sites in mammalian cells, confirming predictions. Inhibiting Ar2 complex below basal nucleation rate inhibited endytic in silico and pharmacologically. The study concludes that spatial segregation of Ar2 complex and HipR on clath coat are important for force generation, two conditions required for effective endytic: one at base for polymerization against plasma and on coat for attachment. The model represents a core machinery for endytic in mammalian cells, with future adding complexity to test roles of filament crosslinking, severing, and myosin motor activity.
Macinocytosis is a cellular process that allows cells to take up large volumes of extracellular liquid into intracellular vesicles, which can extract nutrients, antigens, and other molecules. It is an ancient process used by amoebae, but also important in human biology, including uptake of drugs, sampling of extracellular antigens by immune cells, and hijacked by pathogens as entry route. Recent studies suggest macinocytosis is used by cancer cells to sustain metabolic demands and implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Despite its importance, macinocytosis is not well understood. Macinocytic cups form from cup-shaped plasma membrane extensions, driven by actin polymerization, with a central patch of activated Ras and P3 throughout their life. In Dictyostelium, this patch is associated with a ring of active SC at the edge. The ring of SC is recruited by the patch and drives a ring of actin to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup. A possible mechanism comes from immune cells, which make linear ruffles that fold to form circular ruffles, described as diffusion traps that intensify signalling, leading to a patch of active Ras and P3. However, in Dictostel, linear ruffles are less common, and central P3 of macinocytic cups can form when ruffle is inhibited. It remains possible a diffusion forms by r-independent mechanism, such as septin molecules or crossing components within the patch. Dictostel patches become larger when Ras signalling is increased by NF1 inactivation, showing Ras instructive part in formation. P patches are self-organizing, independent of G-protein coupled receptors and dependent on positive feedback between components. Results argue against role of feedback from P to Ras, as patches can form independently of PI-kin and recruit SC to edges, albeit less efficiently when PIkin present. SC is recruited to periphery of RasPIP patches, possibly by actin nucleators, such as formins, or myosin motors. Early work shows myosin important for macin in Dictostel, and isoforms recruited to macin cups in Dictostel and Acanamo. Myo forms a 'bull's eye' pattern in macin cups, with Myo in centre and Myo at periphery. Our work has implications for Dictostel biology, basal waves formed by loss of NF in axenic strains, valuable for modelling act dynamics. Patches of P and Ras related by SC to periphery, likely organize rings of act polymer, not blocks of pseudods. Role in chemaxis, mistaken for pseudods, needs reevaluated. A hypothesis for cup act structures: arise from ring act polymer recruiting nucleators to periphery, not centre of self-organ patches of Ras and P signalling. This suggests new lines of experimentation.
Cohesin, a protein complex that wraps around sister chromatids, is essential for chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cell division. The cohes loading complex, S2IP and S4, initiates cohes with DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohes loading is crucial for cell division, and defects cause missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to developmental defects in multicellular organisms. The authors present a crystal structure of the interaction between S2 and S4, showing that S4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended S2 peptide. Using yeast, they demonstrate a conserved patch on the surface of S4 is required to recruit S2 to centrom and pericrom. These findings reveal the role of S4 in determining cohes localization and establish a molecular basis for S2 recruitment to centrom.

Cohesin targeting specific locations is required for robust centrom cohesion and tissue-specific transcription programs in multicellular organisms. DNA sequences do not drive cohes loading, instead targeting depends on interactions between the loading complex and chromatin factors. The authors determine the structure of S4 bound to a fragment of S2 and use it to derive alleles that uncouple cohes loading from cohes targeting centrom. Experiments demonstrate cohes targeting in yeast depends on S4, consistent with genetic evidence for an S4-dependent cohes localization pathway. The pathway targets cohes to centrom requires S4 residues, some of which are invariant across eukotes, suggesting the S4 cohes targeting is a general feature of co loading control.

The authors analyze exome data and construct yeast strains with S4 mutations or deletions, confirming viability by complementation of pAL-SC repression. They use PCR and isothermal assembly to generate mutated versions of constructs. Yeast bearing S4 mutations or deletions are constructed by PCR methods previously described. S4-conserved mutations are achieved by replacement of the SCC locus. Viability of scc strains expressing mutants is confirmed by complement of pAL- repression using plasm bearing SCC locus. Viability of scc7 is determined by FACS of homozygous diploid and strain construction by sporulation of diploid strains.

The authors generate w303 strains carrying S alleles by transforming diploid with PCR corresponding full SCC or derivatives and marker. S-G strains are derivatives of S-G from Yeast Clone. Strains for live imaging are constructed by integration of M- into S followed by mating to achieve diploid. Plasm segregation is performed as previously. Aux-indible deon-tag S2 is generated using methods. For complement, SCC-A cells bearing C- plasm encoding S2 flanked elements are grown in SC lacking leine to select plasm. Cells are plated in dilution on SC lacking leine supplemented with Aux. Benyl and nocazole are used. Recomb baculiruses for His-S and His are amplified in S21 for passages. Protein is expressed in Trichia cells infected with equal viruses, pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer. 6-tag S2/ are isolated from supernant by Co affinity followed ion exchange and size chromatography. To S2-S complexes are expressed in Escheria transformed with T promoter induced 400M IPT at OD 0.5. Bacterial are resuspended frozen in lysis containing 800 Na. Upon thawing addition protease, cells lysed by sonication, 6-tagged are purified as full S4.

Selenethion-derivat S samples are prepared as native with exception growth medium. Purified S is diluted gel filtration adsbed to discharged copper grids stained uranyl. SEC-M experiments are performed as previously with 3- size column for truncated S complexes. Crystals S formed at 18 overnight.

This study investigated the effects of time of birth (early-born 'EB' vs late-born 'LB') and food availability (ad-libum 'AL' vs. intermittently fast 'IF') on growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity in juvenile garden dormice (Eliomys quinus). LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals. Torpor use was low during intensive growth, but increased pre-hibern fattening. LB juveniles showed higher tor use, reached similar body sizes, but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibern. LB individuals showed similar hibern patterns, but higher proportion breeders during the following year EB dormice. Results suggest tor is incompatible with growth but promotes preibern fattening and consolidates preibern fat in dormice. Being late in reproductive is associated with fast life history, fast growth, reproduction, and short lifespan.

The study used 36 female gardenice from a breeding colony, reared in unheated and poorly housing under natural photoper and Ta. 12 EB and 12, 12 LB and 6 were studied during preibern, hibern, and reproductive periods, and 6 EB and 6 were sacrificed at early-weaning for body composition. 12 EB and 12, 12 and 6 and 6 were selected based on body at separation from mothers, to match averaged mass. EB were separated at 44.0±1.5 days, 40.2±0.6 g, and LB at 36.0±0.7, 38.8±0.7. After separation, 12 and 12 entered experiments after 4 days habituation cages and nest. Preibern started from separation to start hibern (EB: 12 weeks July to October, LB: 8 September November). Half 12 and 12 were fed AL, half IF. IF food removed 24 hr 2-consecutive weeks. Ta recorded 30 min, fluctuated 15.5-29.5, 22.3±3 and 13.5-24.5,18.5. Body size, mass, food measured once week. During preibern, tor use, activity monitored via nest recordings. Oxygen (VO2) measured at start and end. Prior hibern, all implanted loggers. After surgery, allowed 8-10 days, hibern induced by pairs in refrigerators at 5.3±0.9, upper 5.5±1.7, lower 5.0±2. All entered hibern within 24 hr. Emergence, loggers removed, body mass measured, fecity assessed 24 in May early, 12 in August. Preibern body highly correlated with FM, used mass prior hibern as proxy. Body and growth measured once week. Food provided form apple, cat pellets 40FE, 30,10,9, water aditum. Intake measured weekly. During preibern, nest recordings used as proxy tor, activity. Tor frequency, duration, mean duration, activity time calculated.

This study investigated the role of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nervous system, specifically in the context of chemotaxis, or the ability to sense and respond to chemical stimuli. The researchers used a novel method called SAIL (Software for Accurately Identifying Locations of RNA editing) to identify 736 A-to editing sites in the C. elegans neural transcriptome, including 104 novel genes. They found that 169 genes were misregulated in the absence of ADR-2, an enzyme responsible for A-I editing, and identified cle-41, a gene involved in chemaxis, as a target of ADR-2. Transgenic expression of cle-41 in neural cells rescued chemaxis defects in ADR2-deficient worms, and editing was required for cle-41 expression and chemaxis. The study suggests that ADRs play a role in regulating gene expression rather than generating proteomic diversity in the C. elegans nervous system. The researchers also found that cle-41, a C-type lectin, functions in chemaxis and is regulated by the Protein Kinase pathway, specifically DK-2 isoform, expressed in chemosensory neurons. The study highlights the importance of assessing editing and expression at a tissue or cell-specific level, as alterations in cle- editing and expression were not observed in isolated whole worm extracts.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs various mechanisms to repress cellular mRNA translation while allowing selective translation of viral mRNA. A systematic analysis reveals that viral mRNAs are not preferentially translated compared to host counterparts, and extensive viral translation is due to viral takeover of mRNA pool. This is consistent with NS not being required for host protein shutoff and PA endonuc activity mediating host activity. At 8pi, viral replication is evident, and a portion of plus strand is used as template for replication, potentially underestimating viral TE. SmISH confirms >90% of plus RNA is in cytoplasm. IAV inhibits e2 phosphorylation, but this is not immediate; e2 is phosphorylated at 4pi, affecting cellular gene expression. P-58K expression is reduced during IAV. SmISH correlates with RNA quantification, showing endogenous transcripts reduced similarly in nucleus and cytoplasm. PA activity is mostly nuclear, correlating with cytoplasm half-life. Reduction varies between transcripts, partially explained by cytoplasm half, and significantly by transcript length and GC. Length and GC point to non-selective degradation, with chances of transcript being degraded influenced by quantity exposed ss. IAV degradation depends on length, not reconciling with PA specificity to Pol II and 3' processing. Specificity could originate from physical proximity, or coupled to splicing. Host sh is common, employed by diverse viruses, redirecting translation and inhibiting anti-viral responses. Shutting cellular production has adverse effects, as viruses depend on cellular resources. Transcripts less affected by IAV are enriched in oxidative components and ribosomal proteins, while significantly reduced in cell cycle. Mitochondrial proteins are not affected at 16pi. Inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation impairs replication. Proteins with basic functions have long half-lives, assisting viruses. Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq map changes during herpes and cytgalovirus infections, probing complexity of viruses. SmISH accurately quantifies host sh along infection. Unbiased and systematic methods advance understanding viral interference with protein production, applicable to any virus. A549 cells were infected with IAV/Pu Rico/8/34H1 at MOI 5. Efficiency was confirmed by immunofluorescence and DAPI. Viral RNA was quantified by RT-PCR. Cyclohexide treatments generated ribosome fragments. Total RNA was isolated, polyadenylated, and fragmented, and sequencing libraries made. Reads were aligned to human and viral genomes. Expression was examined for genes with >150 aligned reads. Partition clustering and GO analysis were performed. Babel framework evaluated differential translation. Infected cells were incubated with [35]-methine, harvested, and lysed, and run on PAA gel. Gradients were fractionated, and optical density recorded. RNA was isolated, and cDNA prepared. Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR masterix. Probe libraries were constructed, hybridized, and imaged. FLOSS was computed. Transcripts were analyzed for length, GC, and half-life. Infected cells were harvested, lysed, and blocked, and primary antibodies incubated. Secondary antibodies were incubated, and acquisition performed. Cells were treated with CCC, Valomycin, and stained with TMR, PI. Confluent cells were incubated with virus, washed, and overlaid with agar. Plaques were visualized.
This study investigates the regulation of the Branchless (Bnl) protein, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) morphogen, in the development of the tracheal system in Drosophila. Bnl is produced in the wing imaginal disc and guides the growth of the tracheal branch, the airacprimium (ASP), from the transverse connective (TC). The study reveals that B forms a long-range gradient along the D axis of the ASP through cyton-mediated transport, not passive diffusion. The gradient is dynamic and adaptable, forming in a receptor-bound state within the tissue, and self-generates variable branch-specific shapes by regulating cyton-mediated transport. The study uses CRISPR/C9 genome-editing to generate B:GFP and B:Cherry constructs, expressed at physiological levels, and detergent-free immunofluorescence to detect externalized B molecules. Super-resolution imaging shows B:FP on the surface of cyton, in a receptor-bound state. B is released from producing cells at cyton-source contact sites, likely by energy-dependent transport and endocytosis. The study proposes a model for cyton creating and maintaining a morph gradient, where epithelial cells extend graded cyton to contact the source, reception is contact-dependent, and reception generates tissue-specific shapes. The gradient is robust, self-sust, and self-sust through counteracting activities of Pnt1 and Yan, transcription factors, which regulate cyton formation and B synthesis. The study provides a new understanding of branching morphogenesis, a long-standing question in developmental biology.
The article describes the discovery of a novel protein structure, the α/β coiled, which is a new type of protein fiber composed of alternating α-helical and β-stranded segments. This structure is achieved by inserting 2 or 6 residues into the hept repeat of a coiled coils, leading to the formation of β-layers, which are short β-strands that cross the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The β-layers are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the central residues, deviating from β-sheet geometry. The α/β coiled structure increases resilience by interleaving monomers within the fiber and offers a mechanism to integrate β-str domains into fibers, increasing functional complexity. The structure was solved by X-ray crystallography, with data collected at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland, and processed with XDS, MOLREP, ARP/WARP, and REFMAC. Periodicity was calculated with TWISTER, and molecular depictions prepared with MolScript, RasterD, and PyMOL. Sequence searches were carried out at NCBI, MPI Toolkit, PSI-BLAST, PatternSearch, HMM, HHits, and HHpred, with relationships explored by CLANS and logos created with WebLogo. Secondary structure was evaluated with QuickD, AliD, and co-coil propensity with COIL, MARIL. Searches for β-layers were performed in PDB, scanning torsion angles and hydrogen bonds, verified by inspection.
The study aimed to elucidate the function of epsin, a protein involved in clath-mediated endocytosis, in mammalian cells. A conditional knockout (KO) mice lacking all three eps genes (Ep1, 2, and 3) were generated, and fibroblasts derived from these mice were used to study eps function. Epsin was found to be required for the recruitment of Hip1 to endyticath-coated pits, and its absence resulted in disrupted actin cytoskeleton organization, with loss of stress fibers and accumulation of actin foci near endytic pits. Eps directly binds actin via its disordered tail and interacts with the TH domain of Hip1, linking actin cytoskeleton to clath-coated pits. Eps also binds PI(4,5)P-rich membrane and ubiquitinated proteins via ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). In a cell-free assay, eps was found to be required for endytic budding from plasma sheets, with eps-deficient cytos resulting in abnormal actin growth. Eps binds synaptobrev2/VAMP, a vesicular SNARE, with low affinity, which may be physiologically relevant when combined with bilayer and coat components. Eps is involved in early stages of endytic, including coat formation, budding, and fission, and its absence results in shallow and U-shaped endytic pits. The study suggests eps is a critical coordinator of endyticath-coat dynamics from early to late stages.
A case-control study was conducted among schoolchildren in an urban area in Uganda to investigate the risk factors for asthma. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, aged 5-17 years. Asthma was diagnosed by clinicians based on symptoms and spirometry. The main risk factors for asthma were: tertiary education for fathers (adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85, 1.38-2.48); area of residence at birth, with children born in a town or city having increased risk compared to rural (2.16,1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35); father and mother's history of asthma; children's allergic conditions and atopy; and cooking with gas/electricity. Asthma was associated with a rural-urban risk gradient, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. The study provides basis for future studies to identify environmental/lifestyle factors increasing risk among children in urban LMICs.
In zebraf (Danio rerio) display a characteristic pattern of horizontal and light stripes on their bodies and fins. Three types of pigment cells (chromatophores) are required to create this pattern: iridoph, xanthoph, and melanoph. The pattern is formed during metamorphosis, a period between 3-6 weeks of development. At the onset of metamorph, iridoph appear in the skin at the region of the horizontal myotome, providing a morphological pre-pattern. They proliferate and spread densely to form the first light stripe, while spreading ventrally and dorsally into regions where the two dark stripes will form, changing and aggregating at distance to form the next light. Xanthores cover the flank of the fish, proliferating and reorganizing densely above dense iridores of the light and loosely in dark regions. Melanoblast migrate along nerves into skin in presumptive regions, differentiating and expanding to fill space. In fins, stripe formation does not require irid, suggesting patterning mechanisms in body and fins are different. A number of mutants are known where pattern is not formed normally. One class has one type of cell absent; nac mutants lack melanoph, pfe lack xanth, and sh lack irid. In these, remaining types form irregular pattern. Genes autonomously required in respective types indicate interactions among three types necessary to generate striped pattern on trunk. Several attractive and repulsive signals acting long or short between chromatoph have been postulated. Another class has abnormal pattern with all types present; communication between cells might be affected. Genes in this group encode integral membrane proteins, such as ob/K7.1, a rectifying channel, se/Ig11, cell adhesion immunoglobulin superfamily, or/Tpan 3, transmembrane scaffolding. The best example is leopard (leo), where stripes are wavy or broken into spots. The mutant has been regarded separate Danio species. Dominant alleles in Dan rerio have been identified, and leo caused by mutation connin 41.8 (C41.8), a gap junction subunit. Gap junctions are intercellular channels allowing passage small and ions between cells, responsible for chemical and electrical coupling. They are formed by juxtaposition two hemi-channels, composed six connin subunits in cells. Connins are integral proteins with four transmembrane, two extracellular, one intracellular, and intracellular N and C-termini. Hemi can be homeric or hetereric. Gap conductivity regulated by factors, such as intracellular Ca2+, polyamines, membrane, potential, or phosphorylation. Leo required in two chromatoph types, melanoph and xanth, for homeric and hetereric interactions. Wild-type and mutant C41.8 expressed in melanoph lead to variations in pattern. Dominant alleles leq and lew have missense mutations, leading stronger phenotype than le1. Dominant leK has misense mutation I152, stronger than leq and lew. A genetic screen for enhancers of le1 identified two alleles, luc, encoding connin 39.4 (C39.4). Loss-function of luc similar to le1, but fins not affected. Double mutants le and luc have strong phenotype, similar to homozygous dominant alleles. Strong phenotypes explained by loss of two connins. C39.4 a specific connin, related only in teleost genomes, classified novel or orthogroup with mammalian C37 (G4). Both C.8 and C.39 have no R or W motifs regulating heterom compatibility. Transplantation experiments show leo required in melanoph and xanth, but not irid. No contribution nonpig cells to leo and luc phenotypes. Mutant melanores influenced by wild xanth, forming meandering patches, not spots. Wild melanores
This study investigated the evolution of olfactory receptors in insects, specifically focusing on the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments and the emergence of the olfactory system in insects. The authors selected species at crucial positions on the phylogenetic tree with functional olfactory systems adapted to detect volatile chemicals. Transcriptome data suggest a stepwise evolution of the Or/OR complex, with Orco emerging in the lineage of Diconylia (Zygentoma + Ptery) and the complex ofco and ORs within pteryote (this study, Cly et al., 199; G and Chess 199; Smja et al 2009; Vshall et 199; Robertson Wanner 200; Kirkness 2010). However, none of the experiments led to the identification of ORs orco in the brlet L yata. A number of IRs, including IRa, IRa, and IRb, were identified in the yata antennal transcript. FISH visualized expression of IR in a number of OS associated with basic sens. Based on these results, the olfactory of yata not based on ORs. Insects different sens types house OS typically responding different odors. D melanaster IR functional type OS in double-walled cocon sens, ORs in single-walled basic and trich sens (Hal et 200; Siling 201). The organization cannot exist with one sens type, as in Archaeatha Berg Schmidt 199; Missbach 201 and hexod taxa Colle Alt Pringer 198. The oldest tax double-w sens investigated Zyoma have single-w basic sens with pores and double-w sens with channels Berg Schmidt 199. Cocon sens differ from single-w trich and basic in structure and environment. Cocon thought prerequisite IR Benton et 200; Guo 201. However, in Archaeatha IRs likely in OS basica sens.

A study was conducted to investigate the potential herd effect of mass antimal drug administration (M) on Plasmodium falciparum infections in four villages in Myanmar. The study found that individuals from neighborhoods with low M adherence to M had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-M compared to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito rates, living in a house with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic malaria were predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to M, even in villages with overall high participation, may frustrate elimination efforts. MDA is the provision of medications to entire populations and has been used for various diseases, including lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helmin, oncherciasis, schistosiasis, and trachoma. It has been used for P. falcum malaria and trialed in several locations in Africa and Asia. It is considered a tool for elimination and has been implemented in one setting. Drug pressure through provision antimal drugs provides survival for parasites, leading to hesitance in using M for malaria. M should be used in settings with public health infrastructure, access to diagnosis, treatment, surveillance, and community engagement. Used, M can reduce parasite reservoirs and act as catalyst for regional elimination of P. falcum malaria. Antimals are usually administered after diagnosis or as prophylactic, but M is due to population or community effect. The rationale is that transmission rate is high, sufficient parasite needs to be removed to disrupt. This group effect is referred to as herd and applies to communicable diseases. If sufficient population participates M, transmission cannot be sustained, transmission will cease, leading to reduction in morbidity and mortality. There is a context-specific threshold for M coverage, below which reduction of parasite is not sufficient to halt transmission. Literature suggests at least 80% coverage necessary for M to be successful. The aim of M is to interrupt transmission, notion of herd providing population is plausible but not examined empirically. The study found geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical P. falcum in villages undergoing M. Associations between individual and group participation M, subinfections, and episodes were investigated. PCR-detected P. falcum were widespread at baseline, reduced following M in all villages. Prevalence of PCR-det P falc reduced in control villages prior M. Significant clusters of PCR-det P falc in each village at baseline, no clusters detected post-M. Clusters clinical P falc in two villages. Clusters of non-participation in M in three villages. Sporadic Palc episodes in village post-M, followed by outbreak. First Palc episodes occurred in non-participation cluster. Cumulative plots of Palc episodes in village illustrate patterns according to M nonherence and participation. Proportion of individuals acquired Palc began increasing M for living in mid or high M nonherence. Palc episodes in low nonherence began 1 month after increase in high nonherence but never reached mid or M nonherence.4.4% individuals in low nonherence had Palc by end, to 7.6 in mid, and 9.6 in high nonherence. Increase P episodes coincided with H in village. Palc episodes most likely among 5-14 olds, lived with someone with Palc, and lived in house with someone with P. Lived in neighborhood with proportion people not M had 2.8 times odds of having P. H was associated with odds of having P, 10 increase for every unit.
This study reports the high-resolution DNA-binding specificity of a large fraction of Drosophila transcription factors (TFs) using the HT-LEX method, a technique previously used to determine mammalian TF specificities. Consistent with earlier data, TFs and DNA-binding domains (DBs) recognize relatively long sites, with more than half being >10 bp in length. To analyze the data, novel algorithms were developed, including a distance metric for gapped subsequences, score dinucle preferences, and a method comparing TF specificity models. A new barcode facilitates visualization of similarities and differences in PWMs. The high-resolution data with tools allowed comparison of binding specificities at unprecedented resolution, revealing a striking conservation of specificities extending to homimer sites, secondary modes, and dinucle preferences. This is surprising considering protein sequence similarity between DB ortholog pairs and contrasted with low conservation protein-protein interactions between species. Despite differences in number of TFs, most specificities in mammals were identified in Dophila, suggesting the regulatory code is conserved. A dataset of Doph TF motifs was generated using B1 analysis, with good agreement at consensus/core TF sequences but flanking poorly defined due to few reads. The study extends repertoire of Doph TF specificities, providing novel motifs and shedding light on features of Doph DNA-binding characteristics. Structural similarity defines similarity of DNA site and flanking sequences, with almost specificities available in humans present in flies. Ortholog TFs have identical DNA profiles, flanking, and binding modes, suggesting specificity constrained by structure and difficult to alter over evolutionary time. Gene events after invertebrate vertebrate lineages have not led to novel specificities outside rapidly evolving zinc proteins. Cases of divergence specificity occurred, mostly via duplication and divergence. Examples include non-canonical E2 repressors, ETS III, and nuclear receptors of E and AR subgroups. Conversely, fly nuclear knps and Pax do not have human orthologs and recognize unique sites. Direct orthologs acquired novel specificity in vertebrates or invertebrates, such as bZIP CG20 and nuclear H96. Recognition of secondary site conserved in flies, indicating modes can evolve independently. Cell types defined by expression specific TF combinations, and number correlates complexity organisms. Many TFs with different specificity are related endocrine function or cell types not in flies. Evolution novel binding contributed emergence types differentiated. Results indicate human and fly binding display striking conservation, despite morphological differences over 600 years and lack detectable conservation cis-regulatory. Regulatory code conserved more than sequences.
Researchers have developed a novel strategy to model human cardio-pul co-development using multi-line hiSC differentiation. The study focused on co-induction of cardio-p progenitor cells, establishing a foundation for future investigations of cros between these organ lineages regulating their maturation. Demonstrated that co-ind of meserm and enderm drove simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from respective germ progenitors. Transitioned co-induced cardiac pulmonary progenitors to 3D culture, observed expedited alolar maturation within 3 days, supported by accompanying lineage. In 3 suspension, cardio-pulTs effectively segregated into cardiac and pulmonaryTs, partially inhibited by W activation. Delivered an in vitro model studying mechanistic inter between developing heart and lung during human embryogenesis. The cardio-p interaction during organogenesis has been documented in mouse model; however, translatability to human embry remains due to lack proper systems. Pluripotent cell differentiation offered means recapitulating human organ, tremendous progress made toward cardiac or pulmonary specification.

In this study, researchers investigated the role of hypermutation in Escherichia coli (E. coli) adaptation to ethanol stress. They found that under near-lethal stress, the optimal balance between genetic load and mutational supply shifts towards a higher rate, enabling fast adaptation of some individuals and rescuing the population from extinction. A dynamic mutation rate was observed, increasing as a response to enhanced pressure and decreasing once cells adapted to stress. The emergence of mutators was linked to second-order selection, facilitated by hitchhiking of beneficial mutations. Mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes were identified, suggesting direct effects of MMR mutations, combined with second-order, explain observations. Cellular mortality was a major modulator of population rate, higher rate linked to mortality due to extended genetic load and lethal probability. Mutations in rpo and inf were found in low-tolerant lines, disrupting transcription and translation machinery, preventing further adaptation. Hypermutation was considered a risk for multidrug development in pathogenic bacteria and cancer relapses. Targeting hypermutation could pave the way for novel anti-cancer therapies and containing spread multidrug pathogens.

The study used E. coli strains SX, SX25, SX43, and SX∆us, derived from BW93, with SX characterized by ts-ven fusion in lac gene under lac promoter, SX43 with kanamycin resistance cassette removed, and SX∆us non-fluorescent variant. Mutants were generated by Pvir transduction to SX43 using Ke deletion mutants as donors. Mutations were selected based on roles in DNA replication and repair. Mutants were grown in orbital shaker at 200 and 37°C in lysogen broth (LB) or LB plates. Growth was monitored using Bioscreen system, and optical density measured every 15 min for 5 days. Lag and rates were determined using Gertz equation. Fitness was assayed by direct competition between mutants and ancestor in 5 EtOH, with ratios verified by flow cytometry. Evolution was monitored in 50 ml LB with 5 Et, with 0.5 Et increase every transfer, and 0.25 Et from 7.5 Et. Mutations were estimated by Luriael fluctuation assay, with rifampic resistance in rpo as marker. Mutations were analyzed by CL Genomics Workbench 7.6, with trimmed reads mapped to E. coli MG5 reference. Mutations were detected by CL Fixedlo Variant Detector. Growth curves were made with optical measurements and CFU determination. Death was measured by LIVE/DE Bac Bacterial kit and flow cytometry.

The study found that hypermutation was essential for E. coli adaptation to ethanol stress, with dynamic rate increasing as response to pressure and decreasing once adapted. Mortality was major modulator of population rate, linked to genetic load and lethal. Mutations in r and inf were found in low-toler lines, disrupting transcription and translation. Hypermutation was risk for multidrug in pathogenic and cancer.
Arabidopsis thaliana bZIP63 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in energy response and metabolic regulation. Its expression is sugar and energy-dependent, and it is involved in the regulation of primary and secondary metabolism. bZIP is a member of the C1 group of plant basic leucine zipper transcription factors and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, stress response, and apoptosis. bZIP is composed of a basic region for DNA binding and leucine zipper for dimerization. Phosphorylation of bZIP by AK10 and AK11 kinases is crucial for its activity. AK10 phosphorylates bZIP at serines 29, 294, and 300, while AK11 phosphorylates bZIP at ser 29 and 300. Phosphorylation of bZIP by AK10 and AK11 is conserved in plants and animals. AK10 phosphorylates bZIP at serines 29, 294, and 300, while AK phosphorylates bZIP at ser 29 and 300. AK10 phosphorylates bZIP at serines 29, 294, and 300, while AK phosphorylates b at ser 29 and 300. AK10 phosphorylates bZIP at serines 29, 294, and 300 while phosphorylates b at ser 29 and 300. AK phosphorylates bZIP at serines 29, 294, and 300 while phosphorylates at ser 29  and 300. AK phosphorylates b at serines 29, 294, and 300 while phosphorylates ser 29 and 300 AK phosphorylates b at serines 29,294 and 300 while phosphorylates ser 29 and 300 AK phosphory b at serines 29,294 and 300 phosphorylates ser 29  and AK phosphory b at serines 29,294 phosphorylates ser 29 AK phosphory at ser 29,294 phosphorylates ser 29 phosphory AK phosphory at ser 29 phosphory AK phosphory AK at ser 29 phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK phosphory AK AK phosphory AK phosphory AK AK phosphory AK AK AK phosphory AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK AK
This study describes a novel synapse-to-nucle signaling pathway that links activation of synaptic Glu2-containing NMDA receptors (NMDAR) to gene expression. R10 (R10) is highly expressed in the nucleus and synapses, where it is part of the NAR complex and directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Gl2 subunit of NAR. R10 dissociates from NAR in activity-dependent and provides evidence for import-dependent long-distance transport from syn-to-dend compartments to the nucleus. The cytoplasmic tail of Gl2 contains sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules. R10 and calmodulin share the same Gl2 binding site (991-1029). Results show preferential R10/Glu2 complex in resting, disrupted by calmodulin/Glu complex following synaptic calcium influx. R10 binding to Gl2 plays a role in anchoring R at excitatory synapse and interfering calmod/NAR complex formation. R10 can interact with majority of importin isoforms, including import5 associated with NAR. Together, these suggest syn-to-nuclear transport of R involved in regulating gene expression necessary for long-term plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Few studies address R in CNS, mainly association with transcription factor Me2, regulating proliferation and differentiation (Seki et al., 2000; et al., 2005; et al 2008; et al 2013). Recent study in P19 carcinoma and cerebellar granule cells suggests R acts as positive neuronal regulator, knockdown reducing early and late markers (et al 2013). Microarray, real-time PCR, and western analysis found novel R targets involved in excitatory syn function and morphology (et 2007; et al 2011; et 2012; et 2012; et 2012). R knockdown induced MMP upregulation and concom reduction Arge4, Arf4, and On levels. Intriguingly, these genes mutated or dysregulated in intellectual syndromes and mouse models, characterized by alterations in spines, suggesting role in observed R knockdown. This study demonstrates role in regulating morphology under resting and activity plasticity in hippocal. Knockdown reduced spine density fully rescued by coexpressing resistant R10 construct. Overexpression R10 in hippocal had no effect on morphology. Direct consequence of knockdown observed in spine density and expression PSD95, AMPAR Gl1 subunit, and NAR Gl2 sub. Notably, overexpression R10 in hippocal abolished effect of knock on endogenous R10 mRNA. Specificity of R10 antibody verified by overexpression and knock in hippocal (not shown). Specificity of import1 antibody verified by overexpression in HEK (not shown). R10 was cloned in pKO.1 lentiviral for rat (NM011.1) with scrambled vector from Open (Thermo, Italy). Three vectors with TRIDs TR000112, TR113, and TR113, all validated by real-time rat primary. TR000112 showed highest downregulation >90% and used in experiments (shR10). Knock GlN2 expression set shRNA vectors pFP-R from Orig (Rock, MD). Sequences A, B, C, C, D, and scrambled from Orig (Rock, MD) used as control. Sequence B showed best knock and used for experiments. Validation of resistant R10 rat hippocamp cultures transfected GFP, sh10, RFP10, and sh10+R10. RNA extracted Tryol 48hr transfection retro (Imp, Promega) analyzed quantitative using primers rat10 and human10. Transfection with sh10 resulted in fold decrease endogenous10 mRNA, while transfection R10 resulted in fold human10 mRNA, unaffected by sh10 co-trans. Overexpression R10 in hippocal abolished effect of sh on endogenous10 mRNA
The study provides a structural framework for the interaction of a Swi/Snf ATPase Mot with its protein-DNA substrate, revealing a two-step mechanism for the remodeling of TBP-DNA2 by Mot. The first, TBP and NC's interaction with DNA is destabilized by Mot binding in an ATP-independent manner, followed by ATP-dependent dissociation of the complex. The structure of the MotNT:TBP:DNA2 complex was determined by X-ray crystallography at 3.8 Å resolution, showing MotNT bound to TBP and NC2 on opposite sides of DNA. Mot's HE repeats form a horseshoe shape around TBP, with the latch disordered in the presence of DNA. Mot's Sw2nf domain is positioned to interact with NC's histone fold, similar to nucleosome remodelers. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) analysis revealed interactions between Mot's Sw2 domain and NC. The study suggests that Mot uses a two-step mechanism to remodel TBP-DNA, first destabilizing TBP-NC interaction and then using ATP-dependent dissociation. The structure of MotNT:TBP:DNA complex was determined by X-ray crystallography at 3.8 Å resolution, showing Mot bound to TBP and NC on opposite sides of DNA. Mot's HE repeats form a horseshoe around TBP, with latch disordered in presence of DNA. Mot's Sw2 domain is positioned to interact with NC's histone, similar to nucleosome remodels. CXMS analysis revealed interactions between Mot's Sw domain and NC.
Researchers designed and synthesized variants of the natural product tern, a cyclic heptapeptide that inhibits adipogenesis and is cytotoxic to cancer cells. Inspired by the partially elucidated structure of a related cyclic heptape from Asperg fungus, they designed compounds 3 and 4, which are up to 500-fold more potent than ternatin. Tern and its variants inhibit protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing the greatest potency. The elongation factor-1 ternary complex (EF1·G·TP·amacyl-tRNA) was identified as a direct target of tern-related peptides. This family of N-methyl cyclic heptape represents a new class of elong factor-1 inhibitors. The study sought to identify the target of the cytotoxic product tern, previously characterized as a potent adipogenesis inhibitor. Inspired by the partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic of the heptape natural A, they designed compounds 3 and 4, which are up 500-fold more potent than tern. Tern inhibits protein synthesis with potencies correlate with ability block cell proliferation and photo-tern identified EF1 as plausible. Surprisingly photo-tern cross to purified EF1 only in context ternary with G and amino tRNA. To knowledge specific binding small to EF ternary has been reported. Whether blocks elongation by mechanism analogous kirycin, suggested by dominance tern sensitivity is question awaits future biochemical and studies. Also, discovery two unrelated products, didnin and ansenin, compete for binding EF tern. Combined recent finding nystin targets domain III EF (Krast et al, 2015), suggests four products evolved to shared surface near Ala on EF. didnin variant plidein is in clinical trials multiple myeloma and T-celloma. Drugging surface on EF may have utility.
A study investigated the role of OCRL in clrin-mediated endocyt in Lowe syndrome patient cells. OCRL is a 5-phatase that interacts with clrin and has been detected at late clrin-coated pits. However, its function in clrin-mediated endyt was unknown. The study found that OCRL loss in Lowe patient cells impairs clrin endyt, leading to accumulation of clrin-coated vesicles and delayed internalization of transferr. Electron microscopy revealed increased clrin-coated vesicles in patient cells. Immunofluorescence and microscopy showed clrin-coated vesicles positive for clrin, AP-2, SN9, PIKIIα, and transferr. These vesicles were at tips of actin comets, which are nucleated by PI(4,5)P-positive organelles. Selective depletion of PI(4,5)P at plasma membrane reduced comets. OC has a homologue IN5B does not participate in clrin endyt. OC binds multiple proteins in clrin-coats, including clrin, AP-2, SN9, PIKII, and transferr. OC is required for clrin endyt to prevent ectopic PI(4,5)P accumulation on endosomes and Golgi area. OC interacts with SN9, a protein that couples clrin coat maturation to actin nucleation. SN9 binds PI(4,5)P-rich membranes, clrin, and AP-2. OC is required for cl endyt to prevent ectopic PI(4,5)P accumulation on endosomes and Gol area.

The study reveals a novel FAK/PYK/GSKβ216/β-caten regulatory circuit in intestinal tumorigenesis. Loss of functional APC induces expression of F and PY2, which phosphorylates GSKβ216 to stabilize β-caten, initiating intestinal tumenesis. Phosphorylation of Gβ216 was discovered two decades ago, but its role in W/βaten signaling remains unclear. The study uncovers a previously unreal role of G216 phosphorylation: it triggers Gβ recruitment of-Tr and subsequent β monoubination by-Tr, required for W-induced inhibition of β degradation. Phosphorylation G216 has been shown to be required for β's full activity in vitro, but mutation did not impair's ability to phosphorylate Tau. The study indicates phosphorylation G216 does not affect's activity towards βaten, ruling out possibility that regulates W/aten through modulating activity. G is a prominent target for treatment disorders, including cancer, with over 50 inhibitors developed. The activity plays dual role in W signaling: phosphorylation W coreceptor L on PPP motifs is required activation, while phosphorylation βaten triggers degradation. The study suggests a way of inhibition: targeting phosphorylation, opening avenue for design and development. F plays a role in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, and is required for initiation: organ-specific deletion suppresses mammary tumen, intestinalen, tumen, skin formation, and hepatarcenesis. The study indicates F contributes APC intestinalen through activity. Several F inhibitors are in clinical trials, with phase I promising. A challenge is to identify tumor and patient subgroups responsive to F inhibitors. The study identifies potentially responsive type-colorectal and patient subpopulations with APC mutations. F regulates β dynamics by phosphorylating β142. Phosphorylation acts as switch from adhesive to transcriptional β. The study reveals new role F in regulation: stabilizing β by phosphorylating Gβ. F regulates stem and tissue, given importance W/aten in cell, could provide mechanistic explanation F involved. PY is related to F in sequence and functionally redundantly in context-dependent manner. Despite low expression in intestines, is elevated in adenomas APCmin mice and CRC tissues. The study shows phosphorylating Gβ, F and PY functionally in regulation Waten in CRC, raising possibility F and PY could redund in W-driven intestinalen. However, intestine deletion F alone sufficient to abrogate adenoma APCmin mice, why PY not compensate loss F tumen? PY elevated in tumors APCmin, indicating upregulated during tumen. F induction by APC should occur earlier PY elevation. Inhibition F by deletion sufficient suppress development, PF271 inhibited PY APCmin. Regardless mechanisms PY regulation tumen, elevated PY enhances W-dependenten through phosphorylating to positive loop reinforcing tumor process.
The study investigated the neural control of vestibular balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between standing postures. Ten healthy subjects initiated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EV). The relationship between EV and ground forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinities corresponding null periods were observed preceding the onset of movement and during the termination of locomotion. These results show humans interrupt vestibular balance mechanisms transition between motor states, suggesting a change in motor policies as predicted by optimal feedback theory.

The initiation of movement from a posture is a central issue in neuroscience due to the need to overcome stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Navigating the world involves frequent transitions between posture (e.g., quiet) and movement (e.g., locomotion), representing an ideal model to explore this issue. Balance responses may hinder locomotor initiation and transitions essential to safely navigate the environment. Optimal feedback theory (OFC) proposes the brain implements the optimal means of a task by adjusting feedback to reach a goal. Specific postural and movement patterns are considered control policies, one of which must be disengaged (i.e., by decreasing feedback) prior the engagement of another (i.e., by increasing feedback). This diverges from other motor theories, such as referent control theory, which suggests a monotonic shift in refer body orientation during postures.

The study examined the contribution of vestibular signals to control balance during transitions between quiet standing and locom and between standing postures. Vestibular encodes motion in head space and is vital to maintain stability during quiet and locom. Vestib signals influence activation of muscles in control posture, depending on muscles' engagement and alignment with the plane of instability and direction of vestibular disturbance. Context-dependent vestibular responses have been observed during quiet and locom, where the magnitude of vestib-evoked muscle responses modulated during the phase of gait.

The study monitored vestibular control during locomotor posture-posture transitions by quantifying vestib-evoked responses over the transition. A similar approach has been used to monitor engagement and disengagement of vestib control between self- and externally states. The continuity of vestibular influence postural during transitions was assessed to determine a discrete change in balance mechanisms accompanies transitions between motor states. A hypothesis was that a suspension in vestibular control would occur prior the transition due to disagement of current control prior the implementation of next policy, as predicted by OF.

During quiet standing preceding locom, subjects swayed low forces at feet and small head accelerations. All exhibited EV-GR coherence across 0-10 Hz in both head orientations. At the end of quiet, EV-GR decreased in all subjects. Coherence fell below 99 confidence 0.435 s prior the onset, for duration 0.860 with head forward and 0.259 head left. During transition, EV-GR returned head forward, peaked 0.18 at 6.6 across subjects. Periods significant EVGR continued during locom head forward, but during double phases. Maximum during first locom head was 0.15 at 3.9.

During locom preceding termination, all subjects exhibited EVGR when head forward but not left. EV- peaked 0.14 at 4.6 during head. Expected significant coherence every-support following transition head, but non-significant last-support prior transition most. During transition to quiet, EVGR increased past 99 confidence, remained into quiet. Peak during transition was 0.41 at 3.3 and 0.24 2.4 for head and left.

During posture-post transition, subjects swayed low forces and small accelerations. All exhibited EVGR coherence 0.45 at 3.6. Before onset, EVGR decreased all. Coherence below 99 0.336 prior, remained 0.810. During transition, EVGR returned, remained into new posture. Peak 0
The study investigated the role of the transcription factor Rpa in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus P7942 in regulating circadian rhythms and metabolism. Deletion of rpa resulted in a defect in glycogen accumulation and inability to utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy and reduced fitness. The phosphorylated form of Rpa, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for coordination of anabolism and catabism and cell viability in light/dark cycles. The rpa- strain was unable to accumulate glycogen in light and utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy and reduced fitness.

The article presents the structure and functional analysis of an archetypal P-4-type ATPase, CoT from Sulobacter sp. NAS-1. P-ATPases are crucial for heavy-metal homeostasis, conferring detoxification and redistribution of transition metals across cellular membranes. The P-4-ATP subclass has the broadest cargo scope, but lacks structural information. The study reveals the architecture of CoT, devoid of classical heavy-metal-binding domains (HMDs) and provides new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. Co exhibits Zn2- and Cd-dependent ATP activity, with Co+ only stimulating hydrolysis at high concentrations. The structures of Co in metal-free conditions with phosphate analogs Be3 and Al4 were determined at 3.1 and 3.2 resolution using molecular replacement. The crystal packing reveals minor contacts between adjacent membrane-spanning regions, critical for most P-ATP proteins. The structures show the P-AT architecture, with cytosolic domains, actuator, nucleotide, and phosphorylation, and membrane-spanning domains. The topology of P-AT has been a conund, with sequence analyses proposing different arrangements of transmembrane segments and N-termini. However, data unambiguously demonstrate P-AT possess eight transmembrane helices, MA and MB, followed by M1-M6. The first 47 residues remain unmodelled, indicating P- lacking classical HMD. The Ntermin is rich in metal-binding methion, cystine, histidine, aspart, and glutamate residues, conserved in P-AT. The role of the N-terminal was assessed through an Co form lacking the first 33 residues, showing minor differences in vitro. The MB platform, proposed in P-1 and P-2-ATPases, is present in Co, but its function unclear. The classical view of P-AT is the E2 state outward and E2 Pi occluded, but the structures suggest Co trapped in an E2-like state, with occlusion and counterion interaction earlier than Snt. A conserved K site, allosterically stimulating the E2 to E process, is present in P-AT. The A-P point-interaction is critical in P-AT, with functional of R, D, and D resulting in reduced turnover. P-2 and P-4-ATases serve virulence factors in many pathogens, making them targets for novel antibiotics. Screening a library identified compounds inhibiting Co and Snt, with potent against mycobacteria.
Researchers have identified a specific chromatin signature associated with monoallelic expression (MAE) in human cells, which is characterized by the co-occurrence of histone marks H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me) and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27) in the gene body. This signature was identified using a machine learning approach and experimentally validated in various cell types, including lymphoblasts, embryonic stem cells, and cancer cells. The signature was found in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes, and was not dependent on SNPs or clonality. The researchers also found a relationship between MA and bivalent genes, which are associated with overlapping active and inactive histone marks, and proposed a model for MA establishment in these genes. Upon activation, bivalent genes preferentially resolve into a state with the MA chromatin signature. The study fills gaps in understanding MA, including identifying a molecular correlate with strong predictive power, mapping MA genome-wide in multiple types, and uncovering a relationship with drivers of differentiation. The overlap of MA and bivalent poses a mechanistic puzzle, with asymmetric distribution of H3me and Hme within MA genes consistent with a simple model: Hme associated with silenced chromatin and Hme with actively transcribed genes. This leads to a speculation that transition of bivalent from silent to active happens independently for alleles, with one becoming inactive and the other active. The study creates opportunities for deeper understanding mechanisms underlying epigenetic phenomenon, with presence of Hme implying histone methyltransferase EZ2 and components of PRC complex involved in MA maintenance. Observations suggest Hme andme marks are asymmetric between alleles of MA genes. The study implies similar sets of genes subject MA in individuals, with presence of Hme Hme in one corresponding MA in another. A hypothesis is that capacity MA is controlled by regulatory sequences in cis to affected genes, consistent with inter-species conservation among MA in human and mouse. Epetic of MA affects relationship between genotype and phenotype, with genomically identical clones differing in tumenic properties and drug resistance. The chromatin signature of MA will help exploring relationship MA and cellular states in development and disease.
This study reveals a new mechanism of activity control for Clp, a AAA+ chaper widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria. Coiled-coil domains (MD) control Clp activity by sequestering ClC molecules in an inactive state. This extends the role of coiled-coil domains as regulatory devices controlling AAA+protein activity. MD of ClB/H104 disaggregases function as molecular toggles, crucial for AAA repression in the ground and activation by H70 chaperone. Repression by ClB104 MD relies on formation of a repress belt around a canonical+ ring by interacting AAA1 and MD. Intermolecular head-tail between MD are crucial to keep in repress conformation. H70 binding breaks interactions and leads to Cl activation. ClC MD cannot function similarly due to reduced size, which is too short to span between subunits in hexeric assembly. Instead, ClC form intermolecular head-head allowing docking of layers in helical conformation. This large Cl assembly is inactive, restricting binding substrates, ClP and proteins, and ATP hydrolysis. Cl MD function as molecular switches, ensuring repression in ground and activation in presence adaptors. Dual is illustrated by residue F436 at tip of coiled structure, essential for intermolecular interaction and Mec binding. N-terminal, not for resting formation, plays additional role by going from hidden between MD to exposed, available Mec or adapt. Interaction of MD is limited, implications stability of resting complex. Mec-binding in N and MD are not accessible in resting, suggesting Cl dissociation prerequisite Mec. Mec might bind peripheral ClC causing displacement. Model of S aureus ClC activity differs from previous, showing B subis Cl moneric requires hexamer. Sequest inactive Cl subunits provide protection against non-specific interactions or degradation. Former Cl analysis performed high salt, interfering head-to contacts charged residues. Oligomer dependence Cl on Mec at high salt might represent fail system ensuring adaptor-dependent Cl activation under conditions not resting. Once hexamer ClC/M complex stable, question Cl activation off. Adaptors targeting degradation Cl if substrates no longer available. Mechanism couples substrate with Cl activation, ensuring Cl in absence by dissociation into monomers sequestered. Other chaper machineries also form inactive states converted depending substrate. Constitutively Cl mutants exert toxicity in E and B cells, essential need tightly Cl function. In contrast, no toxicity observed in B cells expressing Cl wild, unlike Cl mutants interact complete adapters. Assume mistarget degradation dereg mutants e.g newly synthesized or secretory leads cell. Homolog MD present AAA members ClE ClL, residues driving resting conserved. Mutating key ClE causes toxicity, repress mode established Cl operational ClE ClL general mechanism controlling AAA chaper systems. Severe Cl and Cl mutants qualify targets antimicrobials. Deregulation bacterial represents antibacterial strategy.
In this study, researchers investigated the behavior of adult precursor cells (AMPs) in Drosophila, which are responsible for muscle growth and regeneration. They used a m-gapFP sensor to visualize AMP morphology and found that they send filopodia to surrounding muscles, similar to vertebrate satellite cells. AMPs are quiescent until mid-second larval instar, when they proliferate. Insulin/TOR pathway promotes exit from quiescence and proliferation, but not sufficient for embryonic AMPs. Insulin/TOR alone not sufficient to end quies during embryonic stages, suggesting complex regulatory cascade for AMP reactivation. Nutrient switch metabolism may contribute to AMP reactivation, as quies cells have few mitochondria and anaerobic metabolism, while activated cells switch to aerobic glycolysis. Genes encoding glycol and pyruv metabolic enzymes act upstream of Ins and Not, providing link between metabolism and Not regulating quies/activated state. Notch is involved in setting AMP quies state, but also promotes proliferation in larval stages. Numb has no impact on AMP proliferation, indicating novel role for Not in symmetric divisions. Not regulates cancer via Myc, and My promotes myoblast development and regeneration. dyc is required for AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic rescue shows Not acts downstream Ins and dyc downstream Not. Non-canonical Not activation involves Delt, likely ligand-independent. Lig-independent Not activation essential for normal Doph blood development. Key role of Insulin in AMP reactivation raises question about source and identity of Ins receptor (In) ligand initiating re. Doph has three Ins-like peptides (Il2, 3, 5) secreted to hemolymph controlling growth, while Il6 produced by gl cells promotes neuroblast proliferation. Lack of effect on AMP in Il2, 3,5 mutants suggests Il unable to reactivate AMP, direct contact between AMP and muscles promotes reception of local Il6 by closely-associated AMPs. Muscle plays niche role in AMP reactivation via non-can Not and dyc. If conserved, this cascade may control human satellite reactivation.
The study aimed to identify the molecular basis of the depolarizing current in substantia nigra pars reticata (SN) neurons, which is crucial for their spontaneous firing and tonic inhibition of downstream areas. Transcriptome sequencing of SN neurons revealed expression of several non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) that could generate the depolar current. NAL was identified as a prime candidate for carrying the depolar leak in SN neurons. Pharmacological and genetic techniques showed that NAL is functionally active in SN neurons, important for maintaining spontaneous firing, and required for sensitivity to glycol and muscarinic receptor stimulation. NAL is highly conserved evolutionarily, with homologs in in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and L stagnalis, critical for pacemaker function in circadian rhythms, locomotion, and respiration. Germ-line ablation of NAL in mice results in death soon after birth due to impairment of rhythmically active neurons regulating respiration. Hippocampal neurons from NAL KO mice show hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating NAL's function in maintaining depolar potentials. Conditional knockout of NAL in forebrain excitatory neurons demonstrated NAL's necessity for circadian rhythms in flies and rodents. NAL also mediates modulatory influences on SN firing, regulating excitability in response to glycol and muscarinic activation. NAL has been found in insulin-releasing pancreatic beta cells, and muscar activation increases NAL activity in these cells. Metabotropic signaling modulates NAL activity in neurons and beta cells, possibly through phosphorylation by Src kinases. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may phosphorylate NAL, decreasing activity during gly inhibition. NAL mutations implicated in human disorders, including motor and cognitive deficits. SN is main output of basal ganglia circuit, providing tonic inhibition targets; NAL mutations may contribute basalgia motor disorders. NAL is major contributor to SN firing, but elimination results in halving firing; other G3-sensitive currents may drive firing. TR7, TR2, and pannin may contribute, but were without effect on firing. NAL expression may be homeostatically balanced with outward-carry leak channels, but no evidence found.
Researchers have developed a novel microfluidic platform for high-throughput cultivation and screening of microbial communities from environmental samples. The system consists of a droplet-based microfluidic chip with a droplet volume of 200 pL, allowing for long-term incubation of 2 million cells in 1.5 mL. The platform enables screening for antibiotic production by adding reporter strains to the droplets. This approach has several advantages over previous microscale systems, including efficient incubation of droplets in bulk, resulting in 180-fold more droplets and higher density than microfluid streaks. The system does not suffer from cross-contamination between compartments and continuous phase. A stable on-chip sorting was demonstrated, enabling screening after extensive aerobic incubation, allowing cells to replicate and reach physiological state for biosynthesis before reporter injection. The cultivation of a complex community rich in recalcant and slow-growing genera showed advantages of inro cultivation. A diverse subset of bacteria and twofold higher CFU compared to plates were achieved due to absence of competition, high incubated cells, and unique conditions in droplets. A bias towards slow species was installed, favoring growth and metabolic activity over fast species. Fast species are readily culturable and have been extensively screened in natural product screenings. The surfact-stabilized droplet boundary prevents cell-contamination, but not abolishes molecular transport for all types. Hydrophobic compounds might leak into oil, while hydrophil substances are favored. The system is adaptable to fastidious microorganisms, representing sources for natural products. The combination of strain discovery inro cultivation with selection of auspicious candidates for product through reporter will streamline efforts towards new antibiotics. The microfluid chip was designed in AutoCAD, printed by JDot, and fabricated by Biot TU Microstructure. Fluids were actuated by syringe pumps and pressure pumps. PTF tubing was used for fluid connections. The device was 3D-printed by material and used as before in a humid chamber. Microfluid operations were conducted on an inverted microscope and imaged with cameras. Soil was collected from a grassland site and processed for CE. The bacterial community was cultivated in medium containing 50% CE, 6% soy, and 44 deionized water. Plates were poured with 2 agar and incubated at 20°C. The reporter strains E. coli and B. subis were used for inhibition assays. Droplets were generated at 150 Hz with volume 200L and incubated in a dropletator. The aqueous phase was transferred to a vessel, and cells pelleted. Plates were pooled by suspending cells in 0.9 NaCl. DNA was extracted from cells and purified with Qhar columns. The 3-4 region of 16S rRNA was amplified with primers 314 and 758. Libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Reads were merged, primers removed, and quality-trimmed. OTUs were detected and taxonomically classified. The OT table was processed and visualized in R. Droplets were generated and incubated with the community. After 1 month, droplets were reinjected into a microfluid chip and spaced to frequency 10-50. Droplets were directed to a capillary and deposited on agar. Plates were incubated 15 at 20°C, and colonies picked. Isolates were obtained and DNA extracted with Qamp. The 16 rRNA was amplified with primers 27 and 149R. Consensus sequences were assembled and curated. Phylogenetic relations were deduced by reconstructing trees. Droplets inoculated the community and incubated 28 were reinjected into microfluid at 200. A suspension was picjected into droplets with an electrical field. Droplets were sorted by dielectoresis and collected on agar. Plates were incubated and colonies picked. Isolates were cultivated in media and crude supern
A Bayesian analysis of the association between leukotriene A hydrolase genotype and survival in tuberculous meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis has high mortality linked to excessive inflammation, however, adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes only a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, the benefit of anti-inflammatory corticoids was most pronounced in patients with C/T variant in leukotri A hyrolase (L4) gene encoding enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosoids. L4 TT patients with increased expression had survival, consistent with corticoids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, an Indonesia study did not find L4 TT survival benefit. Using Bayesian methods to analyze both studies, we find L4 TT genotype confers survival that begins and continues in both populations. This benefit is nullified in most cases with high mortality. L4 genotyping with disease assessment may target glucocortic therapy to most likely benefit.

Tubulous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Despite antimicrobial therapy, it results in 20-25% mortality in HIV-negative and ~40% mortality in HIV individuals (Stadel et al., 202; Thes et al., 2013). A-standing hypothesis that excessive cerebral inflammation underlies TBM mortality (Shane and Riley, 195) led multiple trials of adjunct anti-inflammatory with corticoids (e.g. dexam). Findings from randomized trial (RCT) in Vietnam that adjunct dexam improved survival ~30 led it becoming standard of care (Thes et.,200). However, modest of adjunct dexam treatment suggested heterogeneity glucocortic-respons (Donald and,200; Schoeman,201). Findings in zebish model of TB provided testable for mechanism this heterogeneity (Th et.,200;obin,2012;ob,201). Ebish suggested that deficiency or excess leukri A hyrol (L) a key that regulates balance pro- and-inflammatory eicos, increase susceptibility TBM for reasons too little or much (in,201;ob,201). Became possible test when common human L promoter (17595) was identified comprising C/T that controlled L expression, the allele causing (in201). Retrospective of L175 genotypes in Vietnam dexam cohort confirmed prediction (Th et.,200;in,201). Among HIV-negative, survival dexam was restricted patients with hyper-inflammatory genotype, with potentially harmed (in201). These supported model mortality from TBM due two inflammatory states, and L genotype might determinant of and response adjunct anti-inflammatory.

Two studies of L association with TBM in HIV patients performed in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively (ong et.,201;aroven201). Glucocortic adjunct had become standard care due benefit observed randomized (Th et.,200). All received in both studies. Prediction tested that TT mortality less CC+CT. Vietnam confirmed, Indonesia did not. Cohort had overall 18.8%, similar reported literature (adel et.,202). Feature Indonesia cohort more than-fold mortality comparison Vietnam. Most Indonesia deaths early median 8 versus 50 Vietnam (Table). High raised possibility L4 impact differs severity, not relevant more disease (ava and,201). If, effects L4 being masked by preponder extremely cases Indonesia (ava,201). Both used Cox modelling, approach assumes ratio hazard between groups constant observed (Brad et.,200; et.,201). Analytical method miss differences TBM, disease present yet prolonged-course vastly differing risks time (ong et.,201;es,201;ar201). Testing hypothesis L4 effects limited specific severity requires subgroup analysis. Frequent statistics limit ability perform such because penalties multiple do not real situations (Gel and,201;brahim,200). Bayesian suited estimate effects multiple subgroups because results less problematic frequent (Box and201; McKay,200;amp,202
This study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1-induced axon guidance, a critical for neuronal development and regeneration. Netrin-1 is a well-characterized axon guidance molecule, and its signaling pathways have been extensively studied. However, how netrin-1 is converted into directional force for ax guidance remains unclear. Shootin, a brain-specific protein, is involved in axon outgrowth, and interacts with actin filaments (F-act) and cell adhesion molecules, such as L-CAM. Netrin-1 induces phosphorylation of shootin at Ser101 and Ser249, enhancing its interaction with L-C and F-act, leading to increased F-act-adhesion. This regulation enables efficient force generation for ax guidance in response to netrin. The study shows that 0.4% netrin concentration difference induces 71% shoot phosphorylation within growth, a key readout of spatial signal. Polarized phosphorylation promotes shoot-L-C and shoot-cortin interactions within growth, asymmetrically promoting force on the netrin source side, leading to migratory direction. The gradient-reading machinery involves DCC, Rac/C42, Pak, and shootin, amplifying small differences in netrin concentration. The study also shows shoot1 is expressed in forebrain commiss axons, and knockout mice display dysgenesis and misprojection, consistent with in vitro observations. Netrin- gradients not reported in brain regions, and multiple brain defects in Shoot1 mice, not solely due to ax outgrowth deficits. Gradients of soluble and immobilized netrin on L-C substrate contribute ax turning hippocal neurons, chemotaxis and haptaxis. Immobilized netrin plays key role in spinaliss ax guidance, activating FAK and Crk-associated substrate.
Researchers studied how hummingbirds generate their distinctive hum using a combination of aerodynamic and acoustic measurements. They used a 3D aerodynamic platform to measure the forces generated by freely hovering hummingbirds and high-speed cameras to track wing kinematics. The platform consisted of a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 m chamber with instrumented force plates and cameras. Three stereo cameras captured wing kinematics through orthogonal windows, and force sensors measured pressure and shear. The setup was used for 6 birds, with 2 flights each, and 5 wingbeats per flight, tracking 4 points on the bird. Wing kinematics were filtered with a 4th order lowpass filter at 400 Hz. The acoustic setup consisted of a 0.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 chamber with acrylic sides, LED lights, and 217 microphones (25-7 disabled) surrounding the bird. Top and bottom arrays had 102 microphones, and frontal arrays had 64, sampling at 46,875 Hz. During flight, arrays were covered with cloth to protect the bird and microphones. The feeder was centered 15 cm from the edge and 15 above the array. Sides had optically accessible panels for infrared cameras. The 3D field was reconstructed from planar measurements using near acoustic holography (NA). Frequency components were regularized using a Bayesian method and added together to create broadband results. Linear padding was applied to signals to reduce distortions. Radial directivity was computed using NA.

The researchers found that hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum, with broadband pressure oriented downward, and directivity depending on harmonic. The model explains differences in loudness and timbre across birds and insects from harmonic content in aerodynamic support. Higher content makes flies and mosqu buzz, first and second makes hummingbirds hum, and first gives birds whoosh. The scaling relation shows power proportional to stroke, body, and frequency squared. Analysis across 170 animals in slow flight shows power scaled with mass. Larger birds radiate less power than expected, and elongated flies have a loud buzz. The model and equation can help neurologists and bioacoust interpret loudness and tim and guide bioengineers design silent flapping robots.

The study integrated 3 aerodynamic and acoustic measurements to understand humming. Aerodynamic platform measured forces, and high-speed cameras tracked kinematics. The platform consisted of a 0.5 x 0.5 x0.5 chamber with instrumented plates and cameras. Three cameras captured kin through windows, and sensors measured pressure and shear. The setup used 6 birds, 2 flights, and 5 wingats, tracking 4 points on the bird. Kinematics filtered with a 4 order lowpass at 400. Acoustic consisted of 0.3 x0 x0.9 with acrylic, LED, and 217 microphones (25-7) surrounding. Top and bottom had 102, frontal 64, sampling 46,875.

The article discusses the role of contingency and necessity in the evolution of proteins, specifically in the BCL-2 family, a group of proteins involved in apoptosis regulation. The authors used a combination of ancestral reconstruction and experimental evolution to study the evolution of protein-protein interactions (PPI) specificity in the BCL-2 family. They found that contingency and chance played a significant roles in the evolution of P specificity, with contingency arising from historical substitutions that changed the accessibility of mutations during evolution. The study used a high-throughput phage-assisted evolution (PACE) system to evolve BCL-2 proteins to acquire P specificities that existed during the family's history. The results showed that chance and contingency contributed to the unpredictability of evolutionary outcomes, with the effect of contingency increasing with phylogenetic distance. The study also found that the number of accessible mutations in the past that could confer a selected function was no greater than present, suggesting that ancestral proteins can be useful for producing new functions by design or directed evolution. The results have implications for understanding the processes of protein evolution and the significance of sequence variation, suggesting that present-day proteins reflect the legacy of opportunities and limitations inherited from their ancestors.

The study analyzed genetic data from 48 sub-Saharan African populations and 12 non-African groups to understand the history of human migration and admixture in Africa. The dataset included 250 previously published individuals and 136 new samples from the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network. Genotypes were genotyped on the Illumina 2.5 chip for a genome-wide association study of severe malaria, with initial findings from Gambia, Kenya, and Malawi already reported. MGEN samples were selected to represent main ethnic groups at each study site, with 23 groups having 50 or more individuals. For groups with >50 samples, PCA was performed on genotype data, choosing individuals from cluster with largest number to avoid outlying individuals. In several groups, PCA showed large population structure, choosing two subgroups to represent diversity. Additional individuals from Gambian groups Ful, Mandinka, Jola, and Wollo were included, genotyped as part of The Gambia Variation Project. QC for MGEN was performed for malaria association, excluding SNPs with minor frequency <1 and missing <5, and Hardy-Wein equilibrium. Combined with 1000 Genomes data, including duos, trios, and publicly available individuals from Southern Africa. Merged to forward, removing ambiguous SNPs, checked allele frequencies correlated between datasets. Final dataset had 421 individuals on 328,176 SNPs, removing 1GP populations. Haplotyp phased using SHAIT2, split by chromosome, and used most pairs for downstream. Removed non-founders and high IBD individuals, calculated kinship using piat statistic. Dropped 1GP American populations, keeping 16 Peruvians with Amerind admixture. Final dataset 328 individuals 60 groups. Employed methods to explore admixture: f statistic, AL, MAL, and CHOPINTER to identify events and components. For each event, components sum to 1, multiplied by 100 to estimate ancestry from each group, assigned bootstraps. Summed components ancestry region to arrive plots. Generated maps with rmaps, combining ancestral components and proportions. Plotted arrows from country origin to recipient, only events different gene-flow. Stratified by time, alternative map shown.

Mitotic spindle scaling during Xenopus development is a complex and not well-understood process. To investigate this, researchers established an in vitro system using cytoplasm extracts from Xenopus embryos at different stages of development. The extracts recapitulated spindle size changes observed in vivo, with stage 3 spindles being smaller than stage 8 spind. Spindle size was controlled by microtub dynamics, with increased catastrophe frequency in stage 8 extracts. Kines-13 kifA was identified as a driver of spindle scaling, with its microtub-destabilizing activity inhibited in stage 3 spind by importin. Importin redistributed from cytoplasm to membrane at stage 8, reducing its interaction with kifA and increasing spindle size. Excess kifA decreased spindle size in embryos, but chromosome segregation was robust. Metaphase spindle orientation was randomized in excess kA embryos, suggesting spindle size impacts metaphase orientation. The mechanism of spindle scaling is autonomous and independent of developmental stage, ensuring correct spindle size over cell sizes in the embryo. Importin levels are linked to surface-to-volume ratio of plasma membrane and cytoplasm, with multiple bands in stage 7 and 8 representing different phosphorylation or post-transl modifications. The RanG gradient regulates spindle through stabilizers and motor proteins, and kifA is the first MT-destabilizing protein regulated by this pathway. Kif phosphorylation by aurora and polo kinases modulates its activity, which is also regulated by innercentrom Kin stimulator IC. A comprehensive evaluation of kA interactions will determine how layers of regulation are integrated to control spindle scaling.
This study reports the discovery of riboswitches that form a Boolean logic gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria. Riboswitches are RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in response to binding specific ligands, and previously known classes respond to metabolites or inorganic ions. Here, researchers identified ribwitches for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PR), a precursor for RNA synthesis in all domains of life. PRPP is likely essential for RNA production in early evolution, suggesting that RNA organisms used it to generate building blocks of RNA. Representatives of PR ribwitch were previously identified but difficult to validate due to similarity to guidine and ppG ribwitches. The study found 257 examples of PR ribwitch, 127 in tandem with guanine aptamer, and constructed consensus and secondary model using R2 software. In-line probing and transcription assays showed that PRwitch binds PR, and single-turnover in vitro termination experiments demonstrated that PRwitch promotes transcription elongation. The tandem arrangement of guanine and PR aptam forms an IMPLY logic gate, where expression is on when PR is bound and guanine is not, and off when guanine is bound and PR is not. This is the first example of two aptamers with different lig specificities sharing the same platform, allowing new type of logic. The study demonstrates complex sensing and regulatory functions, reflecting complexity of metabolite monitoring and regulation in ancient RNA organisms. Additional two-input logic gates may be represented by tandem ribwitches yet to be discovered.
The study investigated the regulation of neurotransmitter release at the climbing fiber to Purkin cell synapse using 0.5 mM extracellular calcium, which constrains transmission to the release of zero or one vesicle per action potential. Forskolin, an adenyly cyclase activator, potentiated neurotransmitter release measured by 33% increase in peak EPSC amplitude, but did not change paired-pulse ratio, indicating no change in vesicle probability. The PK activator 6-Bnz also potentiated EPSC without altering paired-pulse ratio. Inhibiting PK with KT0 or 8-Br-cAMP reduced M, but not paired-pulse, suggesting PK regulation of ves release independent of ves probability. Increasing extracellular calcium to 2.5 mM resulted in EPSC with paired-pulse depression, consistent with high ves probability. However, forskolin or 6nz did not alter EP amplitude or paired-pulse in 2.5 Ca+, indicating PK regulation of ves independent probability. The PK activators reduced inhibition by low-affinity antagonist kynure acid, but not high-affinity NBQ, suggesting regulation of ves concentration, not receptors. The PK activators increased frequency of Sr+-evoked asynchronous EPSCs, indicating increase in ves available for release. The cumulative EP during long train stimulation was potentiated by PK activators, with no change in initial facilitation or depression, suggesting regulation of readily releasable pool. The size of the readily releas pool was estimated using two methods and found to be increased by PK activ, with no change in ves probability. The study suggests PK regulation of neurotransmitter release by controlling the number of ves available for release, independent of ves probability.

The study also investigated the role of synapsin, a family of synaptic vesicle phosphoproteins, in PK regulation of neurotransmitter release. Synin KO mice had reduced EPSC amplitude, but similar paired-p ratio, indicating no change in ves probability. The PK activators potentiated EP in het mice, but not TKO, suggesting synin required for PK regulation. The PK inhibitors KT or 8-BrAMP reduced EP in het, but not TKO, indicating synin necessary for PK regulation. The study suggests synin required for PK regulation of neurotransmitter release, controlling the number of ves available.

The study also investigated PK regulation of neurotransmitter release at parallel fiber-molecular interneuron synapses. The PK activators potentiated EP in 75% of syn, with no change in paired-pulse, indicating regulation of ves. The activators increased paired-p in 25% syn, with no change in ves, suggesting regulation of probability. The study suggests PK regulation of neurotransmitter by controlling number of ves, not probability.

The study proposed a model of neurotransmitter release incorporating docking site occupancy and vesicle probability. The model shows PK regulation of neurotransmitter by controlling number ves, not probability. The study suggests PK regulation of neurotransmitter release by controlling the number of ves available, independent of probability.
This study used biochemical reconstitution methods to show that a minimal system consisting of HIV-1 G protein, HIV-1 5' untranslated region (5'UT), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P)-containing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) is capable of selective RNA packaging in the presence of excess non-specific RNA. The study found a strong correlation between the ability of G to multimerize on membrane and selective packaging of viral RNA. Mutations in the lattice-forming CA domain lessen G clustering on membranes (316, 317, and 290) drastically lowered RNA selectivity without affecting the capacity of G to recruit RNA to membrane. Mutations in the C-terminal part of CA (CACT) have been described to lead to virus defects related to aberrant assembly. Live fluorescence microscopy delivered constraints on the stoichiometry and location of RNA event. Genomic RNA is present at onset HIV-1 assembly at plasma, with number of G molecules reported below detection ~12. Cytolic G does not form oligomers and mainly associates with cellular RNAs. SHA analysis focused on secondary structure 5'UT RNA in different stages of packaging showed no gross changes in secondary structure between isolated 5UT, 5UT interacting NC in solution, MA-ag in solution, or recruited G membranes by full G. SHA reactivity indicated 5UT was dimer in solution. The strongest decrease SHA reactivity upon G interaction was in guanine-rich bulges on DIS, consistent with recent study full G in solution. Overall, results show conformation changes upon binding to membrane-associated G are minor magnitude, suggesting conformation rearrangements likely minor contributor selective. Cytolic RNA regulates G membrane association, increasing selectivity plasma lipid PI(4,5)P. RNA binds G MA in cells identified deep sequencing primarily tRNA. Reconstituted system disentangled effect different RNAs on G membrane. Show G-tRNA may serve increase G fidelity viral. Absence tRNA, any RNA caused slight increase G membrane. Presence 20µt, 5UT and longer 194nt HIV increased G more than other RN. Hypothesize viral with high-affinity sites G can recruit several G if one dissociates membrane-occluding t. Study leads model HIV-1 selection NC G necessary but sufficient selective packaging HIV-1 RNA. Lattice conferring G ability multimer on membrane crucial selective packaging viral.
