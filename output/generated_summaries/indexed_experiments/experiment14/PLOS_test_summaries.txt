Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of sleeping sickness, a deadly disease spread by the tsetse fly, in central Africa. However, pockets of infection remain, and it's crucial to assess which areas are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A mathematical model was developed to study sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of Congo and was shown to accurately capture the disease dynamics at a local level of 10,000 people. This is the first time a model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for better understanding of uncertainty. The model used a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to fit data from 16 areas in Mosango health zone, Kwu province. Results showed spatial variation in cases, predicting Kinamba area, with a third of the zone's cases, will be last to eliminate the disease. Deterministic version of the model was faster to fit but produced similar results, suggesting using it for larger areas, but stochastic for capturing uncertainty.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze the tumor microenvironment (ME) of cancer patients, which contains information about the cancer through its cellular and spatial distribution of cells and immune populations. The goal is to explore variations in ME between patients and predict outcomes such as survival and treatment success with immunotherapies. The method uses spatial functions to summarize relationships in ME and applies data analysis and forest models to predict outcomes and identify important relationships. It was tested on simulated data and real data from triple negative breast and lung cancer patients. The method is resistant to overfitting and false discovery.

The approach starts by creating functions for cell-cell or marker interactions in images, reduces dimensions using principal analysis, and combines with patient data such as age and sex, and uses a random model to predict outcome. Spatial functions have been used in ME analysis before. An example shows the distribution of immune cells around tumor cells in a breast cancer patient.

The method aims to compare ME and clinical data between two groups and identify differences in cell phenotypes, proteins, or mixtures. It also predicts a new patient's group using ME data. Various technologies are available, each with benefits and trade-offs. Comparing ME, relationships between cell types, such as tumor and immune, often predict outcomes and guide interventions.
Researchers studied how abnormal neural synchronization in the brain, which is linked to several disorders, affects brain function. They computationally analyzed how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure change during synchronization and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory and fire neurons with different weight and structural plasticity mechanisms: spike-timing plasticity (STDP), homeostatic plasticity (SP) without weight-dependent pruning and ST, combination of ST and SP, and combination of ST and SP with weight-dependent pruning. A simple stochastic model was introduced to accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales. Network theory revealed that structural reorganization remarkably enhances synchrony. Weaker connections were preferentially eliminated by weight pruning, synchrony was achieved with sparser connections in ST-only model. Strengthening contacts from high-firing to low-firing neurons and weakening in opposite direction followed by removal of weak contacts allowed strong synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. Stimulation-induced desynchronization in ST-only model was compared to desynchronization models with and. Latter required higher intensity for long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities for long-lasting relief, e.g. Parkinson's disease.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of some animals, like planarians, to regenerate large parts of their nervous system, including neurons and glia, after injuries. However, this process is a complex and not fully understood. In planarians, neurons and glia come from different types of cells, called progenitors. Researchers found that planarians first make neurons that express a protein called delta-2, which is important in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Later, glia come from a different type of progenitor that expresses a protein called Notch-1. If delta-2 or Notch-1 is blocked, glia are reduced, but other types of cells are not affected. Losing delta-2-expressing neurons stops glia from forming, but transplanting delta-2-express neurons makes gl form at new locations. This suggests that delta-2-express neurons tell progenitors to become glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration. A model proposes that delta-2-express neurons and Notch-express progen interact to make planarian neurons and glia. This could be a solution to the challenge of regenerating neurons and glia, where delta-2 on neurons and Notch on progen specify gl fate. This mechanism could also allow new gl configurations in the nervous system by changing delta-2 expression. Notch signaling is important in neuron development, so researchers looked if it plays a role in planarian gl regeneration. Notch is essential for cell and tissue patterning in many organisms, so it could be involved in planarian gl specification.
Researchers have been working to develop a new HIV vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies, which can prevent the virus from infecting cells. To understand how this works, they studied the role of gamma delta (Î³) T cells, a type of immune cell, in people infected with HIV. They looked at people who developed neutralizing antibodies and those who didn't, and found differences in gamma T cell markers. Gamma T cells were activated early in infection and associated with viral load. Certain markers on gamma T cells, CD16 and CD57, were higher in those who developed neutralizing and associated with breadth later. Levels of CD16 on gamma T also linked to early Env-specific IgM production. This suggests gamma T cells may promote neutralizing, which could help vaccine strategies. 

In contrast, gamma 1 cells expanded during chronic infection and not with viral load. Markers CD16 and CD57 on gamma T were higher in those who developed breadth and associated with neutral later. Levels of CD16 on gamma associated early Env-specific Ig production. Researchers studied gamma cells before and during HIV in people who developed or didn't neutralize, and their relation to viral replication and antibody production. They found gamma 2 cells reduced early and loss with viral load. Understanding how gamma cells promote neutralizing could improve vaccine strategies, especially broad and potent antibodies to HIV Env.
Researchers have discovered that cancer cells secrete two proteins, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), which work together to enhance the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. Blocking these proteins with a new type of medicine, called a bispecific antibody, reduced cancer spread in animal models. Bispecific antibodies are promising because they can target two proteins at once, but scientists need to understand how they work to make them more effective. To study this, researchers created a computer model of a bis antibody that targets IL-6 and IL-8 receptors. The model showed how the balance between the two receptors and the antibody affects how well it works. The study suggests that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a good way to stop cancer from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat cancer for 20 years because they are specific, stable, and can be made in different ways. To understand how the bis antibody works, researchers simulated how it binds to the receptors at different levels of IL-6 and IL-8. They found that how much of each receptor matters for the bis to work well. When IL-6 and IL-8 are equal, the bis works as well as two separate antibodies.
Scientists have long known that centrosomes play a crucial role in organizing spindles in many cell types of species, but most oocytes lack these structures. In C. elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted away from chromosomes to form poles, but outward forces must be balanced to create a stable structure simultaneously. Microtule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization. Researchers studied Z-8, a conserved doubleort-family kinase, the mammalian homolog of microtub-associated protein upregulated in many cancers and implicated in cell division, but mechanisms poorly understood. Z- depletion from oocytes resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles revealed Z- led excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a role in regulating force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z- also required proper microtule dynamics within oocyte and kinase required function during meiosis and mitosis. Findings reveal new roles Z- in oocytes and howcentomal spind are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis.
Researchers investigated the relationship between circulating metabolites, type 2 diabetes (T2), and genetics in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, 92 of which are lipids. They found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2, all lipid-related except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2, spanning all classes, including branched amino acids. Using interaction trait locus analysis, they described four metabolites replicated in Estonian Biob, with genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from interaction analysis are significant for metabolites in population but not T2 risk, suggesting T consequences on genetic regulation. Through differential analysis, 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both T complications, with few discriminating between classes. 40 not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting mechanisms specific complications. The study provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes humans and causes infections, ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. They found two ways the host can survive infection: resistance, which limits the pathogen's burden, and tolerance, which limits the health impact of the pathogen. In a previous study, they found that mice from line CC061 were highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection, while CC024 were tolerant. To identify genes involved in tolerance, they crossed CC061 and CC mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MR infection in F and F generations was 65% and 55, following a complex inheritance pattern for CC increased survival. Colonization in F animals was more extreme than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 was identified for survival and weight change after infection. The WSBi allele in CC mice contributed to MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, with high-impact variants in this region, are receptors for complement Ca, anaphylato, which can trigger massive immune response. They hypothesize Ca may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing damage by cytokine storm and tolerance to higher pathogen and longer survival.
Researchers studied how genetic interactions between genes affect the ability of a population to adapt to its environment. They created a model of a trait controlled by a simple network of genes and simulated how it evolved over time. They found that the distribution of beneficial mutations was not as expected, with fewer large-effect mutations than predicted. The network model also had a complex distribution of fitness effects, with a mix of beneficial and harmful mutations. This is similar to the concept of "cost of complexity" where traits are connected and limit adaptation. The study suggests that interactions between genes can create complex distributions of fitness effects.

The researchers used a combination of biological and mathematical modeling to study the evolution of traits. They found differences in the distribution of beneficial mutations during adaptation, deviating from classical expectations in some cases. Both models showed similarities in key aspects of adaptation, such as the number of steps and distribution of fitness among beneficial mutations. However, the network model had fewer large-effect mutations and approached the optimum slower than the additive model.

The study explored how a simple network influences evolution during adaptation. Traditional models rely on direct genotype-phenotype relationships, ignoring gene interactions that drive trait expression. The researchers considered a gene network to motivate their approach and implemented a nonlinear map into adaptive theory. A trait is controlled by a complex network of genes and regulatory elements that control protein expression. They found that the distribution of fitness changed when non-additive maps were considered and affected the population's chance to adapt.
Researchers have proposed a new way to understand how the brain's cortex integrates information from different sources to make decisions. They suggest that neurons naturally perform this task optimally according to the Bayesian theory, which is a mathematical way to make decisions based on probabilities. The team developed a new view of how neurons and their connections work, called conduct-based, that can do this integration. In this view, the top part of the neuron, called the apical dendrite, represents what we expect to happen, while the bottom part, the basal dendrite, represents what actually happens. These parts are controlled by electrical properties of the neuron, called reversal potential and conductance. The researchers showed that this setup makes the neuron compute the final decision, or posterior. They also found a way for the neuron to learn and adjust its connections based on how reliable they are. This theory explains how neurons work together and how they learn, and makes predictions that can be tested in experiments. 

The team showed that neurons can be seen as computers that make decisions based on probabilities. They found that a type of neuron model, conduct-based, naturally computes the final decision from what we expect and what happens. They also found how the neuron's membrane and connections change based on the final decision. Before this, they looked at what happens when connections change. The new view of neurons predicts different behavior than old models. Without input, the top part of the neuron shows what we expect. This lets the bottom part adjust how good it is at helping the final decision. The team showed how the neuron's membrane and connections change together to make the final decision. They tested this with a task that uses many senses and found it works. They also looked at how the bottom part of the neuron learns from the top. In this view, the bottom tries to match what it gets to what we expect. The team also looked at how one neuron works and found the same result. They used that many inputs make a normal distribution, which agrees with data.
Researchers have used the AlphaFold database to predict protein structures for 48 whole proteomes, which are sets of proteins from different organisms. They used these predictions to classify and catalog domains, which are parts of proteins that perform specific functions. They found that they could classify 90% of the residues, or building blocks of proteins, in these proteomes. This means they identified 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins made up of 226,424,000 amino acids. They looked at similarities between proteins in eukaryotes and bacteria and found that eukotes have more disordered regions and unassigned domains. Eukotes also have more proteins with globular and small repeats. They found common domains shared between eukotes and bacteria, such as Rossm, TIM, and P-loop domains. They compared their predictions to a reference database and found that some groups were enriched. This has implications for selecting targets for future classification of large protein sets.
Researchers studied how the BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) causes kidney failure in transplant patients and found that it relies on the host cell's cell cycle to replicate. They used single-cell analysis to track the virus's large antigen (TAg) expression throughout the cell cycle and found that robust TAg expression is needed for viral DNA replication. This contradicts the current model that TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into the S phase for replication. Instead, BKV requires an initial S phase to replicate, similar to other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. The study used inhibitors to prevent cellular replication and found that TAg and viral production rely on initial S phase. BKV is unusual as it re-replicates host DNA and re-replication is needed for viral replication. To enter S and re-replication, the current model proposes early TAg causes S entry for viral. However, the study found that canonical licensing and firing mechanisms are required for re-replication and displayed activity across the cycle. This changes the understanding of BKV life cycle to include initial S for robust T expression and production. Late genes showed VP/3 expression followed TAg as cells progressed to-replication, suggesting virions formed in replicating cells. This agrees with BKV life cycle model, TAg precedes late proteins but replication after 4N.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have become a powerful tool for identifying genetic associations by combining gene expression studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most existing TW approaches focus on one gene at a time, but recent developments in TW fine-mapping enable joint modeling of multiple genes to refine identification of causal ones. However, these fine-mapping methods primarily focus on quantitative traits and local regions, leading to suboptimal performance. A new TW fineapping method, FIO, is designed for binary traits, capable of modeling all genes on a chromosome. FIO employs a probit model linking genetically regulated expression (GRe) of genes to outcomes, accounting for Re among genes on a chromosome. As a result, FIO controls false discoveries and offers substantial gains over existing TW fineapping approaches. Simulations evaluated FIO's performance and applied it to six binary traits in UKBiob datasets, reducing causal sets by 27.9-36% over existing approaches. Leveraging power, FIO prioritized multiple genes associated with diseases, including GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, Btn2 and Hsp, play a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. When cells are exposed to high levels of hydrogen peroxide, proteins can become misfold and aggregate, leading to cell dysfunction and toxicity. Btn and Hsp help to sequester, or store, these misfolded proteins in specific sites within the cell, preventing potential damage. However, their exact functions and substrates, or targets, were not well understood. The study found that Btn and Hsp are required for cells to tolerate oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. They act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined sites, and their absence leads to accumulation of protein aggregates. The toxicity of aggregate causes sensitivity in Btn Hsp sequease mutants. Overexpression of H104, a protein that breaks down aggregates, rescues oxidant tolerance. The researchers identified Sup35, a translation factor, as an in vivo sequease substrate and show that Btn and H act to suppress formation of the [PS+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup35. Pion formation in sease mutants does not require insoluble protein localization, where amyloids are thought to fragment and propagate. Instead, both amorph and amyloid Sup aggregates increased in Btn Hsp mutants, suggesting prion formation occurs at multiple sites during oxidative stress. The study shows protein sestration as a key defense mechanism to mitigate consequences of protein-induced aggregation.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to identify non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in glioblastoma (GB) invasion, a type of brain cancer. Most previous studies focused on coding genes, but few looked at non-coding RNAs. They used CRISPR-interference (CRPR) to evaluate the function of GB-associated lRNAs in an unbiased screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. A CRPR lRNA loss-function screen was implemented to evaluate the association of lRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion in Matrig. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knock in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TC) and Genotype Expression (GT) analysis. Mediators of lRNA effect were identified via differential expression following lRNA KD and assessed for invasion using knock and rescue experiments. Forty lRNAs were significantly associated with 33-83% decrease in invasion (p0.01) upon knock. The top, LINC45, identified effect and size p-value, demonstrated 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while L45 expression was associated with patient and tumor grade (p0.000). RNA analysis of L45 knock revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor studies, highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS KD associated significant in invasion. WAS overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive lost with L45 KD. CR screening identified L45, previously unannotated lRNA, as critical GB invasion Gene is associated with grade and survival.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes sequences of auditory stimuli. They used electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of sounds generated by a stochastic process. A new clustering method was developed to group EEG signals based on their patterns. The goal was to identify the brain's model of the sequence of sounds. The method allowed for a more efficient model of the data. Previous studies assumed specific brain models, but the actual model used by the brain was unknown. This study found that the brain uses the repetition of a sound to build a model of the sequence.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, but has limitations. It fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcript size and dissociation/processing-induced gene expression, particularly in heterogeneous tissues that require dissociation for analysis. This leads to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, researchers propose a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF). They introduce a concept and method for computing c and report WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc data and WF. WF also predict aging progression, suggesting diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanism. The study provides a method to solve sc-se limitations in complex tissues and suggests biological significance of WF.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach called radial multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) to estimate the effect of multiple exposures on an outcome simultaneously. This method extends the traditional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, which uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. However, traditional MR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants, which affect multiple traits. To address this, radial MR visualizes the effect of each exposure in a VM analysis and allows for removal of outlying SNPs that violate assumptions. A software package, RM, is presented to implement the method. The effectiveness of radial MR is demonstrated through simulations and real-world analysis of the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease. The approach visualizes causal estimates and provides diagnostic information on underlying assumptions of MR. Radial MR facilitates assessment of pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using GWAS data, making it easier to identify outliers and estimate direct effects of multiple exposures.
Researchers studied the behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) over a period of 7 days to understand how their behavior changes across different timescales. They recorded the flies at 100 frames per second using a camera and used a deep learning framework to create a dataset of nearly 2 billion instances of the flies' postures. The team identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion and used the data to explore how the flies' behavior changes throughout the day and days. They found daily patterns in these behaviors, including trends in grooming, probis extension, and locom speed, which added to what is known about the flies' circadian cycle. A unique point in the flies' daily pattern was found to be the hour after dawn, which tracked with other indicators of health such as locom speed and time spent resting. High-resolution data revealed differences in morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily in grooming behavior, and daily patterns in all measured behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locomotion. A decline in difference between day and night hours across days was seen as the flies weakened and died, similar to weakening circadian rhythms with age.
Researchers have identified a new functions for a protein called PTP-22 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, beyond its role in the immune system. They found that P-22 plays a role in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A genetic screen showed that loss of P-22 activity alleviated molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in related kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which act at the interface of membrane and actin regulation. To understand P- functions, the researchers carried out proximity studies to identify interactors of P- during development. They found the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P. Loss of DN- also suppressed mol defects. Genetic, localization, and labeling studies revealed P in several epidermal complexes, including hemidesomes, suggesting P plays a role in maintaining tissue integrity. P was also implicated in nucleocytoplasm transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, as one-third of proteins identified by P labeling are gran components. These studies highlight the utility of genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel functions.
Malaria is a major public health concern in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Greater Mekong region, where the gold-standard antimal drug, artemisinin, is losing its effectiveness due to resistance. If artem resistance spreads to Africa and India, malaria-related deaths will significantly increase. To combat this, understanding the spread of artem resistance is crucial. However, data on artem resistance in Southeast Asia are limited. Researchers used a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network to track non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 (K) gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian geostat model to create spatio-temporal predictions. Their maps show the expansion of the K mutation across the region from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The study provides critical information for malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia by predicting the first spatio-temp patterns and extents of artem resistance at a subcontinent level.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, NLR1 and CARD8, play a crucial role in the body's immune response to infection. These proteins exist in different forms due to a process called autoproteolysis, resulting in full-length, cleaved N-terminal, and cleaved-terminal peptides. These peptides form inhibitory complexes in the body's steady state, but the exact mechanism was unclear. The study found that both NLR and CARD form inhibitory complexes involving N-terminal and cleaved-terminal interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. A specific region in mouse NLR1 and a region in rat CARD mediate these interactions. Additionally, a cellular enzyme called dipeptid peptidase 9 interacts with these complexes, affecting their structure and function. The enzyme binds to full-length and cleaved peptides of some NLR and CARD, but not others. Experiments showed that dipeidase does not affect the inhibitory activity of N-terminal on cleaved. This research enhances understanding of how these proteins regulate the immune response and highlights the complexity of their interactions.
Defects in protein homeostasis can lead to proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and overall health. In various tissues, cell-based mechanisms detect and eliminate compromised cells, referred to as "losers," by healthier neighbors. The connection between proteotoxic stress and cell survival remains unclear. Researchers studied the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in developing Drosila wing epithelium. Loss of R1 caused proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2. Analysis showed R1 mutant cells identified as losers and eliminated through competition. Interestingly, R1 levels increased upon Myc-overexpression, causing overgrowth under prote stress. Results suggest R1 provides protection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating stress, supporting overgrowth. R acts as a novel regulator of proteasis in Dila, revealing role in cell survival.
Researchers have found that mutations in the CHEK2 gene, which helps regulate cell growth and division, are linked to an increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3,188 amino acid changes caused by non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of CHE2 have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHE2-encoded protein (CHK2). To test the function of these variants, scientists used a method called yeast complementation, where they tested if the variants could fix a mutation in the yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. This method has provided information on over 100 CHE2 SNVs and aligned with results from human cell and pathogenic assays. The study tested all 4,887 possible SNs in the CHE2 reading frame for ability to complement RAD53 using a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS). Of the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results match previous and function data and provide a new test for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can help predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants found in screening and be applied to other cancer genes.
Scientists have discovered a new way that the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae controls its genetic makeup and physical traits. This bacterium forms different populations with distinct genetic and physical characteristics, such as opaque and transparent colonies, due to DNA changes in the opacity determinant (cod) locus. The researchers found a system called Spx1-Ten that regulates these changes, affecting the bacterium's epigenome and traits like colony opacity. Spx1 and Ten are part of a type II toxin-antitoxin system, where Ten is a toxin and Spx1 is an antitoxin. When Ten is overexpressed, it causes growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S. pneumonia, and Spx1 represses the transcription of the sp1-ten operon. Ten binds to ribosome factor Rim, reducing sigma factor Com, which activates transformation genes. Reduced Com expression enhances invertase psr, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshapes pneumoccal epigen and colony. Spontaneous variations in the promoter region generate subpopulations with epetic and phenotypic diversity.
A new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) has been developed to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions and extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can't accomplish this because they operate on one dataset at a time. Contrastive PCA was proposed to address this problem, but has seen little adoption because it requires a hyperparameter, resulting in multiple solutions with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, PCA treats foreground and background conditions differently, making it unsuitable to compare experimental conditions symmetrically. gcPCA is a flexible, hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. It analyzes the covariance of datasets to find dimensions that exhibit largest changes between conditions. This builds on contrast PCA, but eliminates the need for hyperparameter. gc is useful for analyzing high-dimensional biological data, such as detecting hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity in type II diabetes single-cell sequencing. It's a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method for comparing datasets to gain insights into complex phenomena.
Researchers have created a detailed model of how B cell receptors (BCR) signaling works in Burkitt lymphoma cells, a type of blood cancer. BCR signaling is crucial for B cell survival and maturation, but is often deregulated in lymphomas. The team used data from two Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, BL-2 and BL-41, to create a semi-quantitative model of BCR signaling. The model revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including a negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK. This cros was confirmed in different B and CD40 signaling in BL cells and verified by phosphoproteomics on ERK and ERK sites. The BL-2 network was transferable to BL-41 cells and also modeled B signaling in Diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling. The model showed that B aberration does not cause major rewiring of downstream signaling.
Researchers have long known that the Notch receptor plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance, with its activity regulated by two opposing mechanisms: cell-to-cell interactions between neighboring cells and cell-to-cell within the same cell. Different combinations of Notch receptors and ligands trigger distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling. This study explores how two ligands, DLL4 and JAG, control angiogenic sprouting through a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches. The findings reveal a new role for heteromeric JAG/DLL complexes, enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. A heteromeric J/DLL complex, formed when ligands are in the same cell, relieves Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient Notch signaling. Experimental results show DLL homomers, DLL-JAG heteromers mediate Notch receptor inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves a regulated interplay between Notch and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEF) receptor (VFR) signaling. The study proposes a new model of DLLAG-Not signaling and a theoretical model DLLAG-Not-VEF signaling. A model of Notch signaling is presented, incorporating the finding J1 antagonizes DLL through hetereric DLL-J1 complexes, underlying observed effects J1 and DLL in sprouting.
Researchers have developed a new clustering method called Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM) that takes into account the uncertainty associated with data points in bioinformatics and other fields. This method is an extension of a Bayesian non-parametric algorithm that uses the uncertainty to improve clustering results. The researchers tested DPM on simulated data and found it outperformed existing methods. They applied DPM to cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to the sample size of the study. DPM separated autoimmune diseases from other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. They also used DPM to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarized using gene signatures. A new procedure was introduced to generate a summary of a gene signature on a different dataset than where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three gene datasets with IMD were analyzed using relevant signatures and DPM found associations between disease and clusters replicated across datasets. This work shows that when data has uncertainty, it should be used to inform clustering and presents a method to do so, DPM. Additionally, a procedure was presented to use gene signatures in datasets other than where they were defined, shown by summarizing gene expression from patients with IMD using DPM.
Deep neural networks have been successful in modeling the primate visual system, but struggle to account for the importance of shape in primate vision. Humans judge category membership largely based on shape, while networks rely more on color and texture. Researchers have documented this issue, but the reasons are unclear. To investigate, we created artificial images where shape, color, and texture can be used to predict class. By training networks to classify with single features and combinations, we found some architectures can't learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. This bias is due to interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent, suggesting different algorithms with sparse, local changes are needed to make networks sensitive to shape and improve human-like vision.

We used artificial images to study why deep networks prefer color and texture over shape. Some architectures, like transformers, are structurally unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks develop bias despite learning shape-based classification. Instead of changing architecture, enabling shape recognition requires algorithm changes. Our results show color and texture bias arise from gradient learning dynamics, specifically how gradients align with classes. Breaking this requires changing gradients, except for spConv, all convolution networks show bias towards color or texture. We analyzed ConvNet to understand this bias, finding they can classify by shape but fail shape-based if another feature predicts class. Humans and networks differ in feature reliance, shape, color, object, or patch. We followed a similar approach, focusing why networks fail shape classification. This is true for color and texture networks, but not shape networks. We hypothesize dominant dynamics explain bias. Reducing alignment enables shape classification
Researchers have developed a new model to study how liver cells called hepatic stellate cells (HSC) contribute to liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic diseases. HSC produce a protein called extracellular matrix (ECM) that leads to fibrosis. The model uses a computer language called Kappa to study H dynamics during fib progression and reversion. HSC are modeled as agents with seven cellular states that interact with a molecule called TGF1, which regulates H activation and secretion of collagen, a main component of ECM. Studies show HSC play a critical role in fib progression and reversion. Inactivation of H allows elimination during reversion, but reactivation of inactivated Hs (iSC) sustain fib. The model is sensitive to TGF1 levels, suggesting it can adapt to different disease conditions. Data from a mouse model of liver fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of iSC in chronic disease. RNA sequencing from patients with liver disease confirmed this, identifying iSC as markers of fibrosis. The study provides a model of H dynamics in liver disease and can explore role of iSC in liver homeostasis. It can also be applied to fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze data from multiple studies to understand how genes affect health outcomes, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This method, called meta-analysis, is often used to combine data from many studies to find overall effects, but is not often used for complex data like genes. The new method, called MEGA, can handle large amounts of gene data and account for differences between studies, like different testing methods used. It's more efficient and accurate than analyzing each study separately. The team applied MEGA to data from over 5,800 people in the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine program to see how genes affect blood pressure and cholesterol. They found different results compared to analyzing each study alone. The method is available online for others to use.
Researchers have developed a new method, called PWH, to identify the genes that drive cancer growth in individual patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH looks at how mutated genes affect other genes in a group of patients with the same mutations. This approach helps find both common and rare drivers of cancer. In tests on 16 cancer datasets, PWH outperformed other methods in identifying known and new drivers. It also improved tumor stratification and understanding of cancer heterogeneity, a step towards personalized treatment. One predicted gene, Low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP1), was validated to promote tumor growth in cell assays. 

A key aspect of cancer overlooked by existing methods is that patients with same driver mutations share same mechanism, unlike those with passenger mutations. PWH incorporates relationships between mutated and abnormally expressed genes, improving prediction. Despite limitations, PWH showed reliable performance in inferring drivers, promising for discovering obscured variants by heterogeneity. Future, PWH will aid personalized treatment development. 

PWH is a genome/transcript analysis to identify candidate drivers by mutated genes' influence on networks across samples. Hypothesis is that samples with same cancer type share molecular characteristics compared to different types. Leveraging same type samples improves prediction. PWH requires cancer samples, mutation, expression, and interaction. For each type, predicted drivers were compared with other methods on overlap with known drivers. Number of drivers identified by methods is shown for each type.
Researchers have developed a computer model called the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) that simulates epilepsy by combining personalized brain anatomy with dynamic models of abnormal brain activity. This model can generate seizure patterns similar to those recorded by invasive methods like stereoelectro EEG, allowing for testing of hypotheses before surgery. To improve the model's accuracy, the researchers used a global optimization approach called SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm that uses parallel computing to find high-quality solutions quickly. They tested the model on synthetic data and found it outperformed other solvers in scalability and performance. Additionally, they used a Bayesian framework to fine-tune the model's parameters, improving accuracy and efficiency. The team also added a phase to quantify uncertainty in the model's parameters, assessing variability across different problems. This study aims to improve brain area estimation in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. 

The VE model relies on estimating parameters in a high-dimensional space to identify brain networks involved in seizure generation. Accurate modeling is challenging due to complex brain networks and limited data from recordings like sterelect EEG. Optimizing parameters is key to understanding data-generating mechanisms in pathological conditions like abnormal brain dynamics and connectivity. The researchers tested VE on different configurations, showing whole-brain simulations and sensor-level SEEG data.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. While it's understood that TB is due to Mtb growth in the lungs, the rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of infected animals, such as monkeys or rabbits, are largely unknown. Researchers infected rabbits with a virulent M isolate of the Beijing lineage, H878, carrying an unstable plasmid p10, and found that p10 is more stable in H878 than a commonly used laboratory-adapted strain H37v. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in M-infected rabbits did not follow an expected decline; the percent plid cells increased between 28-56 days post-infection and remained 84-112 days-in despite a large increase in bacterial numbers. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monot change in plid cells can be explained by a lung M population of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: one expanding early and controlled/eliminated, while a smaller expanding at times causing a counterintuitive increase in plid cells. A model with homogeneous M population couldn't explain the data when run stochastically. Results suggest bacterial dynamics in granomas are independent.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool called GlycanModeler that can predict the structure of carbohydrates attached to proteins, known as glycans, with high accuracy. This is a challenging task because the structure of glycans is difficult to determine experimentally. Glycaner uses data from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was tested on a variety of glycan structures and showed high accuracy in both predicting new and building from experimental data. It was also used to design a glycan shield on a protein to prevent antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work can aid in predicting glycoprotein structure, glycan masking, and experimental structure refinement.

Glycobiology tools have been developed for protein glycosylation, validation, chemistry, analysis, and docking. Traditional glycop modeling involves molecular dynamics simulations or manual placement of glycans into density. Recent tools focus on using density for structures with many glycans, like HIV. Glycaner was tested for density-guided modeling and decoy discrimination.

Glycaner and associated tools can model glycans through novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm was optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, with a median RMS of 2.7.7. The results show Glycaner can predict structures novo, build into density, and be used for sugarcoating protein surfaces.
In the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, the protein ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF (Skp-Cul1-F-box) complex plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control by targeting specific substrates for degradation. The Skp1-Cul-F-box complex recognizes substrates through interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate, with the F-box determining substrate specificity. However, the limited number of identified ubiquitin-ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. In P. oxalic, transcription factors such as Brl, CreA, Xln, and Ace1, conserved in filamentous fungi, regulate fungal development and transcription of hemi-cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1, also known as Slt, positively correlates with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively with expression of hemi-cellulase genes. The ubiquitinase-substrate pair SCFbx-Ace1 is identified in P. oxum, with most Fbx present in free form within the nucleus and a small portion associating with Sk1 to form Fbx-Sk1 heterodimer. Under glucose, Fbx absence results in decreased transcription of brl gene, which encodes master for asexual development and spore pigmentation genes, and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemiulase genes in Fbx mutant are upregulated. Fbx acts as transcription coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace, allowing latter to regulate transcription of genes with different effects under signals.
The basement membrane (BM) is a crucial component of tissues and plays a key role in organ development. However, the mechanisms behind its formation and diversification are not well understood. Researchers studied the BM in Drosophila melanogaster and found that it is composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix. They identified two routes for protein secretion: Rab10 and Rab8. Both routes are necessary for BM production, but they compete with each other. Rab10 promotes lateral and polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, leading to fibril and homogenous BM formation. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 are in the same compartment and DAP is essential for fibril formation and orienting secretion towards Rab10. The exocyst complex has a dual function: it interacts with dystroph to limit polarization and is required for Rab8 route. The study shows how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and how diversification arises from different routes with distinct exit sites.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict how the human body's immune system can resist HIV-1, a type of the virus that causes AIDS. The model, called language-based universal model (LB), is a type of multi-task learning (MTL) model that uses information from multiple related tasks to improve its performance. Unlike previous models, LB is trained on data from multiple antibodies at once, not just one at a time. This approach, called multi-task learning (MTL), has shown to improve predictions and address two main challenges: some HIV-1 subtypes are underrepresented in available data, which affects the model's ability to generalize, and combinations of antibodies are needed to avoid resistance to a single antibody, but finding optimal combinations is a problem. LB mitigates underrepresented subtypes and learns patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict antibodies' targets and select optimal combinations. The model, publicly available online, can be adapted to other diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow, causing abnormal growth of cancerous plasma cells. Treatment outcomes vary between patients, making it crucial to develop predictive models for informed decision-making. Previous models focused on genes, ignoring the role of pathways in disease progression. This study used two strategies to build models considering pathways: pathway score method and group lasso. The former converted gene expression to pathway scores for fitting. Three methods (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 databases were used for pathway information. In microarray data (GSE324), a model with best performance was obtained. The model was compared to gene-based and published models in external data. Results showed group lasso with pathway information (Vax) outperformed gene in both internal and external validation. Immune pathways were more predictive. Vax also outperformed published models. The new model was resistant to missing values, with <5% not affecting accuracy using imputation. Pathway-based models using lasso were alternatives to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM) with imputation method for future validation.
Mitochondrial fission, the process by which a mitochondrion divides into two daughter organelles, is crucial for cellular response to injury. However, the mechanisms regulating this process are not well understood. Researchers developed a nonlinear dynamical systems model of Drp-dependent fission to identify key parameters controlling the rate of fission. The model showed that the total fission rate (TFR) and cumulative fission (TF) depend on a single parameter, mu (Î¼), which represents the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers. Surprisingly, TF does not increase monotonically with Î¼, instead, it increases to a point and then decreases as Î¼ continues to increase. This non-monotonic dependence suggests that targeting certain parameters may have non-intuitive effects on fission. Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters like Î¼ may aid in future therapeutic selection.

The model, based on ordinary differential equations, focuses on Drp-dependent fission following cellular injury when Dr1 concentration in cytosol is increased. Dr1 has been observed on newly created mitochondrial ends for a period, which could be incorporated into the model with a delay or additional pool of fission complexes. This would affect available cytosolic Dr1 and concentration's effect on TFR and TF.

The model undergoes Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter Î¼ = k + k - M, where M is total concentration, k+ and k are association and dissociation constants between oligomers on outer membrane. Î¼ can be thought maximum rate disassembling oligomers. Nondimensionalization results in four dimensionless parameters, but TF strongly depends only on Î¼.
Researchers have developed a new genetic tool to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests using CRISPR-based gene drives. One challenge in using these drives is the rapid evolution of resistance. To combat this, they targeted functionally constrained regions with multiple gRNAs. A study constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosoph suuk, a notorious pest. Results showed low homing in germline but feeding octamine restored egg-laying in T2 mutant females, making it easier to maintain than other drive targets. A similar system was tested in Dros melanogaster and additional drives with promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Findings suggest genetic polymorphisms in populations limit drive spread and Cas9 activity. The study highlights rescuing female infertility caused by drive, a valuable for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
The brain's ability to learn and remember is not only limited by the energy needed for computation, but also by the energy required to form and store memories. Research has shown that even simple learning tasks that require only a few changes in the connections between brain cells, called synapses, can be costly in terms of energy. However, learning complex tasks like recognizing images with 95% accuracy require at least 108 changes. This suggests that the brain has evolved to learn using as little energy as possible. Scientists explored the energy needed for learning in a type of neural network called feedforward networks. They proposed two algorithms that save energy: 1) only changing synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to a subset of synapses that form a path through the network. Current methods update all synapses, even if not all are needed. In this case, savings can be achieved with only a slight increase in time. Restricting plasticity helps save energy associated with changing synapses. The results may lead to a better understanding of how the brain learns and a better match between artificial and biological learning. The algorithms may also benefit hardware as electronic storage is energy costly.
Scientists have engineered microbes to have smaller genomes to make them more efficient by deleting non-essential genes. However, this often reduces their fitness. Researchers studied how evolution can recover lost fitness in six versions of the bacterium Acinetobacter bayi AD1x with deletions of 22-42 kilobases and two larger deletions of 70-293 kilobases. They evolved populations of AD1x and each strain for 300 generations in simple and complex media and sequenced the genomes of endpoint isolates. Fitness increased in all cases except two that failed in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding and small RNAs were associated with environments and deletions. The global regulators ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq were mutated across strains, but effects varied with deletion and environment. Mutations in this network likely compensate for earlier deletion in AD1x ancestor. Results show that lost fitness can be regained through evolution and often through specific and global adjustments.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebraf, a vertebrate model organism. They used a self-caving ribyme, a type of enzyme that cuts RNA, to reduce expression of a target gene. The tool, called Ribo, was inserted into the gene that controls pigmentation in zraf. When activated, Ribo reduced expression by 20-fold and caused a pigmentation similar to a mutant zraf. The effect was reversible, meaning it could be turned off. A version of Ribo, called RFlip, was created to control expression of another gene. RFlip was activated, expression was reduced and pigmentation was similar to mutant. This shows RFlip can be used to study gene function in zraf. The tool is an alternative to existing methods to control gene expression in vertebrates.
Researchers have developed a new software called "aiSEG" that can identify and segment cells in microscopic images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This is a significant breakthrough as it eliminates the need for special dyes, reduces toxicity, and speeds up imaging. The software uses a type of artificial intelligence called convolutional neural networks (CNN) that can detect cell structures in transmitted light images. It's user-friendly and can be used by anyone, even those with no coding experience, and is available in both command line and graphical user interface versions. The software was tested on various cell types of cells and imaging conditions, including low magnification and time-lapse imaging, and showed accurate results similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, such as quantifying biosensors and signaling activity. The software is adaptable to new cases and can be retrained with just 32 images. It's also not limited to microscopy and can be used with other types of images.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to identify relevant features in new environments. They asked if people rely on prior knowledge about common properties of features that predict rewards. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviorally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. They tested if humans learn faster when relevant features change slowly rather than quickly. In two experiments, 295 participants learned rewards of two-dimensional bandits when one feature changed slowly or quickly. Participants earned more rewards when the relevant feature changed slowly and the irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. They didn't differ in generalizing to unseen values between conditions. Models showed participants learned faster with slow features and adjusted to relevance and speed. The more improvement in performance for slow bandits, the more they adjusted learning rates. Results suggest humans favor slower features, a bias in how they approach learning. 

 Participants learned faster when the reward-predict feature changed slowly and irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. After, they generalized equally well in both conditions. Models showed participants adjusted learning to the speed of features. Causal processes evolve slower than noise. They tested a decision task with one reward-predict and one-irrelevant feature. Analyzed choices to learn the feature-reward mapping. Accuracy increased from chance in first to last trials in all experiments. Learning rates mediated the effect, suggesting differences driven by increased slow and decreased fast. The study extends research on humans and suggests it aids learning in reinforcement.
Researchers have found that patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER) breast cancer have the worst prognosis and often experience rapid progression to metastatic disease after diagnosis. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in solid tumors, so understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse genetics approach, 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility were previously identified. This study extends those findings to identify Res1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis gene in ER breast cancer. Res1 is a large, unstructured protein with conserved intron structure, but poor amino acid conservation. CRIS or trap mouse models crossed with Polyoma-T antigen engineered mouse (MT-PMT) showed reduction of Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and increased lung metastases. Analysis of matched tissues revealed loss of wildtype in tumor, consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcription control through association with quadruplex sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis. Results suggest loss of Res1 enhances progression in ER breast cancer through transcriptional and translational control.
Researchers studied the role of two proteins, Mec1 and Rad24, in meiotic recombination in yeast cells. Meiotic recombination is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes during reproduction. Mec and Rad are part of the cell's response to DNA damage, helping to repair breaks in DNA. The study found that loss of Mec and Rad affects meiotic recombination in different ways. Without Rad, recombination is reduced and spore viability is low. Without Mec, recombination is increased, but spore viability is not affected. However, in both cases, complex recombination events between closely spaced DNA breaks are more frequent. This suggests that Mec and Rad help regulate where DNA breaks occur. They also found that without Mec or Rad, crossovers are more random, indicating a loss of regulation. This is similar to, but less extreme, the effect seen in other mutants. The study shows that Mec and Rad have distinct roles in meiotic recombination, with Mec regulating frequency and Rad promoting crosso.
Researchers have long struggled to culture the fungus Pneumocyst, a deadly pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, due to its inability to grow in vitro. To address this challenge, a comprehensive in silico-scale metabolic model of Pneumyst growth and metabolism was developed using published data and bioinformatics tools. The model identified metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth, offering insights into the organism's biology and a strategy to overcome culturing it in vitro. 

A genome-scale model for the mouse-specific pathogen Pocystina was also created to test hypotheses generated by the model and compare growth in vitro to in vivo. Predictions regarding Pyst growth and metabolism were made, including critical components of its medium and how to supplement it for enhanced growth. The model replicated drop and knockout experiments, highlighting its potential in developing antifungal targets.
Researchers studied how a protein called YAP/TA affects cell growth in normal and cancer cells. They found that at low cell density, Y/TA helps cells grow, but at high density, a different pathway called Hippo stops Y/TA, moving it to the cytoplasm and stopping growth. Cancer cells have more YTA than normal cells, but it's unclear if this is enough to keep growing at high density. The team created a 3D model that includes cell interactions and the Hipp-YTA pathway. They simulated various YTA levels to see how much is needed for cancer cells to keep growing at high density. Results showed that a two-fold increase in YTA is enough for cancer cells to keep growing, but not normal cells. This model can help evaluate cancer based on YTA levels, develop drugs to stop cancer growth, and find right dosages.
Researchers have discovered that certain proteins and RNAs with low-complex domains (LCDs) have a tendency to form molecular condensates, which are complex structures that separate from the rest of the cell. Mutations in LCDs can cause these condens to become solid-like, leading to problems. To understand how LCDs work, scientists created an energy framework that looks at how "stickiness" rather than specific sequences. They compared sequences to random patterns and found that periodic LCDs promote elasticity, while random sequences are more viscous. The study found that minimum periodicity is key to keeping condens fluid, preventing solid-like states. The framework also explains recent findings on prion domains and predicts changes in condens viscoelasticity. The research provides a new perspective on how sequences affect material properties, with key features conserved while sequences vary.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, begins. A key step in this process is the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesyme as the organ takes shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is crucial for epithelial morphogenesis, but how this leads to cell rearrangement and shape changes is unclear. Using the mouse dentition as a model, scientists found that non-mus myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by activating my II via AK. Inducing AK and my II can also rescue defects caused by inhibiting Sh. Results support a model where Sh signal is transmitted through my II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin data, allowing for a deeper understanding of complex biological processes. They combined data from two types of sequencing techniques, scRNA-seq and scAC-se, to create a unified cell atlas. However, previous methods had limitations in preserving cell variations and heterogeneity between datasets. A new model, scGCN, was created to address these issues, achieving high performance and low memory usage. It successfully integrated data from different modalities, such as APS-se and C-seq, and showed accurate label transfer across modalities. 

To improve robustness, more powerful transfer learning and generative models are needed. A single-cell graph convolutional network, scGC, was proposed, treating transfer from sc-se to sc-se as a domain adaptation problem. Efficient multi-stage learning was used to integrate gene and chromatin data into a multi-omics cell atlas. The model is a black box, making it difficult to understand its decisions. scGC is a novel approach combining different measurements, even unpaired data. It aggregates cell relationships and gene expression with convolution, based on regulatory mechanisms between sc-se and sc-se. MK-MD-based adaptation was used to leverage domain effects. Multiple kernels were explored for adapting representations, enhancing effectiveness between embeddings. sc-se and sc-se. scGC accurately transferred cell annotations across datasets, species, and layers, such as sc-se and sc-se.
Researchers have identified a specific sequence in a protein called Mc3 that helps it enter the cell's nucleus. This sequence, called a nuclear localization signal (NLS), interacts with a protein called importin to get into the nucleus. The LS is short and rich in basic amino acids, but it's hard to identify because it doesn't have a single, universal sequence. Scientists studied Mc3's LS to understand how it gets into the nucleus and loads onto chromatin, which is essential for cell growth. They used mutagenesis and a computer modeling tool called AlphaFold 3 to see which basic residues in the LS are crucial for interaction with importin. Disrupting these interactions stops Mc3 from entering the nucleus, affecting chromatin loading and cell growth. The study provides a framework to predict other LS that don't have a single sequence but share characteristics with Mc3 and another protein, SV40 large antigen. Characterizing Mc3's LS will help understand its nuclear import and chromatin loading, and predict other LS in many proteins. Mutations at specific residues in Mc3's LS were critical for its function, especially at positions 2 and 3, which interact with importin. Unexpectedly, a mutation at position 4 didn't affect import, suggesting it's less important. Further studies are needed to understand Mc's interactions with importin and how mutations affect nuclear entry.
Ataxin-2, a protein implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinsonism, plays a crucial role in translational activation, translational repression, and mRNA stability, and assembly of mR-granules through its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Research has shown that the LSm-like domain of At2 can stimulate translation and antagonize mR-grule assembly. New experiments on Drosophila and human Atin-2 proteins reveal that the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein content of Atin-2 m-grules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila indicate that the At-LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At2-induced cytotoxicity. The data suggest that Atin-2 interactions remodel translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of R-gran condensation and neurogeneration.
Researchers studied how genes control the development of muscle stem cells in different parts of the body. They focused on Pit2 and Pax7, two genes that help create muscle stem cells. They used mice with modified genes to turn on or off these genes at different times to see how it affects muscle stem cells. They found that Pit2 is important for muscle stem cells in eye muscles, but not as important in limb muscles. When they turned off Pax7 in adult mice, more stem cells disappeared in eye muscles than in limbs. They think Pit, Pax, and another gene My5 work together to keep stem cells in eye muscles. They also found stem cells in eye muscles are less active and don't multiply, but have more stem cells per area. In mice with muscle disease, stem cells in eye were less and didn't multiply. This study shows how stem cells are different in different parts of body and why eye muscles are spared in disease.
Researchers have identified several variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since 2020, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron lineage, and others. These variants show different levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, requiring specific defense measures. To study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among humans, a new infectious disease model was proposed, combining epidemic data with physical neural networks (PINs) to create a mechanism called VOC-informed network (VOC-IN). Experiments showed VOC-IN accurately fit data from British Columbia, Canada, and simulated unobserved dynamics, time-dependent parameters, and short-term predictions. Results also revealed variations in control strategies across regions. VOC-IN performed well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data.

A new algorithm, VOC-IN, was introduced, integrating epidemiological data, deep learning, and models to estimate COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic. It emphasizes patterns in multivariate data for optimization and accurate fitting. Variants differ in transmissibility, disease, severity, immune evasion, and treatments. The World Health Organization defines VOCs as major evolutionary, necessitating public measures. Simulating transmission and time characteristics of SARS-2 variants is crucial.

VOC-IN leverages observational data and physical principles to capture time-vary parameters. Studies have shown PINs fit compartment models and estimate timeary parameters effectively. Inspired, VOC-IN was proposed to fit and infer timeary parameters by encoding VOC data, epidemiological mechanisms, and ODE into networks.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CytoNet, a deep learning model that improves the accuracy of cell profiling by 30-68% compared to the traditional method of averaging cells. This method, called CytoNet, uses self-supervised contrastive learning, a technique that groups similar cells together and pushes others apart in a feature space. This allows it to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. Unlike previous methods, CyNet requires only perturbation labels, which are readily available in most cell profiling datasets. It also provides a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost performance on image-based datasets. 

CytoNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological feature data and providing an aggregated profile as output. It achieves this by downweighting small or noisy cells and prioritizing large crowded ones. The model can be applied to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in genomics. CyNet provides an easier and better method for aggregating single image data compared to published strategies and average baseline.
Researchers have found that the brain's ability to solve complex tasks relies on changes in how brain activity is organized in space and time. When these changes are disrupted, it can lead to problems with attention, distraction, and adapting to new situations, making it harder to complete tasks efficiently. To better understand this, a new method was developed to measure brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) to see how much effort is needed to perform tasks. The method looks for patterns in brain activity and how they change over time. It was tested on a task where people respond to one part of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting part. Results showed a link between effort and brain activity, proving the method's effectiveness. This study opens up new ways to understand how the brain uses energy to think and perform tasks.

The study used a mathematical framework to measure brain effort in existing data and found a connection between effort and demand during a specific task. It's the first to apply this method to EEG data, providing a way to measure effort in brain experiments. The research bridges a gap by using EEG, which measures brain activity more directly than other methods. It analyzed EEG data from people doing a task where they respond to one part of a stimulus while ignoring another. A similar method was used on fMRI data but tasks were different, making it hard to compare. This study investigates changes during tasks and if effort can explain brain's energy needs for different demands. Other measures exist to quantify effort, like entropy and Hurst exponent, but lack clear interpretation and don't account for dynamics.
Researchers studied how the body's immune system responds to malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium vivax parasite. They found that people infected with malaria developed a type of immune cells called atypical B cells (aBCs) that can produce antibodies to fight the parasite. These cells, called PvDBI-specific aBC, were present during illness and after recovery from malaria. To understand their role, the researchers isolated a single aBC and tested its ability to produce antibodies. Some aBC clones produced high levels of antibodies, similar to those made by classical B cells. Two clones, A12 and B11, produced antibodies that neutralized the parasite's ability to infect red blood cells. This suggests aBC play a role in protecting against malaria by producing antibodies. Identifying these cells can help develop effective vaccines. In a study, 17% of infected individuals had PvI-specific aBC, with 28% expressing classical B cell phenotype. Four aBC clones produced low levels of antibodies. The researchers also tested if aBC can produce antibodies against different parasite variants and found that two clones A12 and B11 did. This study shows aBC can differentiate into antibody-secreting cells and produce protective antibodies against malaria.
Researchers have developed a new method called MR-MASHS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, to predict complex traits in genetics. MRASH requires individual-level data, which is often not publicly available due to privacy concerns, and doesn't scale well with large datasets. MRASHS uses summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel, making it more accessible and scalable. Simulations show MRASH is competitive and outperforms current methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios. A real analysis of 16 blood traits in the UK Biobank shows MRASH achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample sizes.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, by taking into account the differences in how people's susceptibility to infection in different areas and over time. This is called spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The model, called Universal Differential Equation (U), uses a neural network to approximate the rate at which people become infected. It was trained with data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai and compared to a traditional model. The new model predicted 80.06% of the population would be infected and a peak of 3.17%, while the traditional model predicted 99.97% and 32.78%. This is an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. The new model also showed that heterogeneity in susceptibility decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak by 30-70 days, matching real data. This study lays the groundwork for new models and insights on heterogeneity.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain are noisy, which is surprising given their high energy consumption levels. They propose that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainty about the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework shows that the synapse interacts with the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This suggests synapses use an internal model of the neuron's membrane, updated by a learning rule similar to established mechanisms like LTP/LTD. Synapses also use noise to encode uncertainty about the neuron's potential. Each syn tries to predict the postsyn's dynamics, but many synapses in a network can solve problems like classification or control in a dynamic environment by coordinating uncertainties.

The study shows synapses can exploit noise to encode uncertainty about the neuron's membrane potential. This enables a network to encode and utilize uncertainties. The model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode the membrane potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic changes in plasticity and weight. It applies to individual synapses, considering dynamics as an agent interacting with its environment, deriving a learning rule to minimize surprise. This enables synapses to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes, registered by backpropagating action potentials.

Synaptic variability can reflect uncertainty in firing. Postsyn learns to fire according to Gaussian distributions with different spreads. Variability in firing is reflected in spiking learning. During stochastic firing, high trial-to-trial variability in membrane dynamics is observed. The syn's task to learn responses is like behaving in a partially unknown environment, using variability to represent uncertainty about the cellular state.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup to reconstruct cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method is useful for studying how cells develop and differentiate, and how cancer progresses. Single-cell sequencing allows for more detailed analysis with higher resolution. Scup is designed to handle challenges of single-cell sequencing, such as missing genetic information and errors. It uses a neighbor-joining algorithm to compute distances between cells and reconstruct the tree. This method is faster and more accurate than current methods. The researchers tested Scup on synthetic and biological data of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing can reveal more genetic mutations than other data types. However, it comes with challenges like missing information and errors. This highlights the need for sophisticated models and methods. Scup is a distance-based method that reconstructs cell trees from single DNA data. It distinguishes between genetic mutations and sequencing errors caused by amplification. The method was tested on data of 18 cells with a known lineage. These cells are closely related, making it hard to reconstruct the true tree.
Researchers have developed a new tool to help low-income countries like Malawi make the most of their limited healthcare resources and improve population health outcomes. This tool, called the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, simulates the impact of different healthcare packages (HBPs) on the country's health system, taking into account realistic constraints such as available resources, disease incidence, and healthcare capacity. The model was tested on Malawi and found that a healthcare package prioritizing high-impact treatments achieved the largest health gains, an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023 and 204. However, this approach incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Another approach, prioritizing patients rather than services, showed consistent gains over time and a 5% reduction in DALs over the period. This suggests prioritizing patients might be beneficial in the future. The TLO model provides a detailed evaluation of health gains from prioritizing services under realistic constraints, addressing limitations of other methods used to weigh interventions.
Researchers studied the process of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpella, a species that diverged from the silkworm moth Bomby mor over 100 million years ago. They used a technique called Oligaint FISH to visualize chromosomes at high resolution and found that meiotic pairing in both species starts at gene-rich chromosome ends. Both species form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bomby, Plodia can orient bival in multiple ways at metaphase. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of where they are located in the bivalent. Sister kinchores are not paired, but four distinct kinchores are observed at metaphase. Microtubule attachments hold these kinres together. This challenges the classical view that paired pole-facing kinres are needed for accurate homolog separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model organisms, which can lead to novel discoveries.
Researchers studied the median eminence (ME), a part of the brain that connects the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. They found that a mutation in the SOX3 gene causes hypopituitarism, a condition where the pituit gland doesn't produce enough hormones. This is likely due to a problem in the hypothalamus, not the pit gland itself. They discovered that the absence of SO3 mainly affects the median eminence in young animals, even though SO3 expression starts early in embryonic development. Hormone levels in the pit gland are reduced due to lack of cell maturation. Medianence glial cells and oligodendrocy differentiation are also affected. Treatment with low-dose aspirin, which affects glial cells, rescues proliferative defects and hypituitar in SO3 mutants. The study shows a role of glial cells in medianence during postnatal development and their sensitivity to external signals.
Researchers studied how a protein called F-act, which is important for cell movement and development, is regulated in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that a protein called CED-10/Rac activates F-act, but needed to identify the protein that activates C-10. Another protein, C-5/C-12, is known to activate C-10 and promote cell movement, but surprisingly, it also inhibits F-act in migrating cells. To understand this, they looked at C-12's ability to act as a GAP, a protein that turns off Gases. They found that C-12 has a GAP region that is separate from its activating region and mutating it affects cell migration, not corpse engulfment. Interfering with C-5's ability to bind to C-10 also resulted in loss of movement and corpse engulfment. Studies suggest that C-5/C-12 uses different domains to promote and inhibit F-act formation. To promote corpse engulf, C-5/C-12 activates C-10 as a GEF, but for migration, a different GEF must activate C-10. Other GEFs in C. elegans regulate CDC-42 or RHO. C-5/C- and C-12 act as a bipart GEF for C-10 during cell death and migration. C-10 promotes ventral enclosure. The GEF for C-10 during migration is unknown.
Researchers studied how the brain processes information across different timescales in the visual system of mice. They found that information and correlation times of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. The study used information-theoret and autocorrelation analysis to investigate temporal processing in the mouse cortex. They tested whether the increase in timescales is gradual or parallel, and found that a gradual increase had more power for both correlation and information times, indicating a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in visual cortex. A hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer integration of information, which is thought to cause long times in primates. The study found that feedforward processing predicts higher times and more hierarchy under stimulation with a movie with long times compared to spontaneous activity without a visual stimulus. Modeling suggests that decrease in predict can be caused by increase recurrent, as stronger coupling leads to reduction of correlations from stimuli. Decrease in predict can also reflect efficient coding, where processing removes more redundancy in spike trains. Results indicate network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase recurrent, shape temporal hierarchy.
Researchers used epidural recordings from the spine to study how the brain responds to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive treatment for psychiatric disorders. They created a computational model of the motor cortex to understand how it responds to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. Analysis identified important pathways and used machine learning to find common features among them. Sensitivity analysis found neuron types that contribute to corticospinal waves, waves that can be predicted by shortest path to layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons. Results show different pathways contribute to corticinal waves with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to motor cortex and specific neurons initiate different waves. The study provides a method to analyze complex models and relate to network structure to understand response to acute stimulation. 

The corticosp waves represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons that send to spinal cord. Shortest direct wave is direct activation of these neurons. Intrinsic mechanisms allow them to behave as oscillators, causing waves from repeated spiking due to initial excitation by T. Computational models integrate anatomy and electrophysiology to investigate T-induced cortosp waves. The most important feature of cortisp wave is conduction delay to layer 5 pyramidal neurons, with 81.6% accuracy. Sensitivity analysis found important mechanisms, such as excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
Cell-free placental DNA, or cDNA, is present in a mother's circulation throughout pregnancy. It's been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and makes up about 40% of total plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used for non-invasive prenatal testing (NI) to screen for fetal genetic issues, such as chromosomal abnormalities. However, the biology of cDNA is not well understood, limiting its research and clinical use. This review examines current knowledge of cDNA, its origins and characteristics, gaps in knowledge, and future directions.

cDNA is shed from the placenta into mother's circulation throughout pregnancy. It's used in NI to screen for fetal genetic issues, like chromosomal abnormalities. Studying cDNA will improve understanding of placental processes that generate it, its role in pregnancy, and how it can be used to monitor placental health and disease. Fetal and placental genomes are usually identical, but placental mosa can occur, where they don't match. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between "fetal" and "placental" DNA when discussing cDNA.

cDNA represents the placental genome, allowing non-invasive genome characterization. NI has been used to screen for common chromosomal abnormalities, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 by assessing overrepresentation in plasma. Its effectiveness has been reviewed elsewhere. cDNA is a powerful tool for studying placental development and disease, currently hindered by limited early and mid-gestation samples. This opens avenues for more clinical applications beyond current NI, which is limited to genetic screening.
Researchers have found that three types of hormone-dependent cancers - breast, endometrial, and ovarian, and prostate - share common genetic risk factors, suggesting a common underlying cause. Genome-wide studies have identified hundreds of cancer-specific genetic variants, but also found that some regions of the genome contain variants for multiple types of these cancers. This suggests that certain genes may be driving these associations. By analyzing data from large-scale studies, the researchers pinpointed 44 regions of the genome that contain risk for at least two of these cancers, with some containing variants for all three or four. They identified 53 candidate genes at these regions, many of which are known to be involved in cancer but have not previously been linked to hormone-dependent cancers. Additionally, they found long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in these cancers and variants in regions that affect transcription factors, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Some of the identified genes are targets for known drugs, implying they could be used for new treatments or repurposing existing ones. This study provides a framework for finding genes driving complex traits and understanding susceptibility to hormone-dependent cancers.
Researchers studied a disease called polymyositis in the Kiker dog breed, which suggested it might be inherited. They looked at the DNA of 33 dogs with the disease and 106 without it to find the cause. A region on chromosome 19 was linked to the disease, and a 2.9 megabase region was shared by dogs with the disease. Sequencing showed a 39 kilobase deletion 10 kilobase upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The deletion was found in 81% of diseased dogs and 25% of healthy Kiker dogs. Cells from diseased dogs overexpressed IL21 and IL when stimulated. The researchers think elements 10-49 kilob upstream of IL/IL play a role in regulation and deletion is a risk factor for polymositis. Disease penetrance was 10-20% for homozygous and 0.5-2% for heterozygous dogs. They suggest distant variants upstream IL could be important in human autoimmune diseases linked to IL/IL. No variants were found to cause disease, but may be at least 10 kilob upstream IL. The study shows ILIL locus is involved in Kiker polymositis, but the element and function are unknown. It will be interesting to see if human autoimmune diseases with ILIL have variants in the same region. A test for the deletion can help breeders prevent high-risk dogs and reduce polymos in Kiker.
Researchers have developed a new language model called ESMm that can predict the stability of proteins, which is crucial for various applications such as food processing, therapeutics, and identifying disease-causing mutations. The model was trained on a massive dataset of 528 natural and artificially created protein sequences from 461 domains and can handle insertions, deletions, and multiple mutations. The study shows that ESM can be fine-tuned to predict stability and performs reasonably well on small proteins and generalizes to sequences not in the training set. However, its performance on longer proteins lags behind state-of-the-art methods. The researchers also found that training on multiple domains instead of a single domain improves the model's performance. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on diverse sequences like those found in nature.
Researchers studied the role of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIR) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1), a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the pancreas. iRs are a family of receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. They regulate the immune response by binding to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. The researchers wanted to know if iRs affect the association between HLA and T1. They analyzed a dataset of 11,961 people with and found that iR genes, when present with their ligands, had a significant effect on HLA class II associations. This was confirmed in an independent dataset. The study suggests iRs decrease protective HLA II associations, indicating they regulate CD4 T cell responses in T1. This is similar to their effect in chronic infections, where iRs enhance or decrease protective H disease associations.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is a leading cause of age-related vision loss and the most common repeat-mediated disease in humans. Up to 80% of FE cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat (CT18.1) within the ubiquitously expressed gene TCF. The non-coding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms of disease. Researchers studied primary corneal endothelial cells from a large cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded (Exp) and CT-independent (Exp) FE. They used long-read, short, and transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific biomarkers. Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcript data revealed altered splicing within Exp FE and transcripts associated with CT18-expans. Differential expression highlighted transcript consequences of Exp within cells. Exon usage, pathway, and spatialomics revealed T4 isoform skewing in Exp with potential consequences. Exome data from 134 FE cases identified rare variants in 7 cases, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. The study supports two pathogenic mechanisms: RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation underpinning FE pathophysiology.
Researchers have found a way to improve rice germination in cold climates by identifying a gene called GENERAL REGULATOR FACTOR14 (GF14) in the rice variety Arroz Terra. This gene helps seeds germinate quickly at lower temperatures. They found that the Arroz Terra version of GF14 is functional, but a Japanese variety called Hitomeore has a deletion in the coding region, making it non-functional. Experiments showed that knocking out GF14 in a near-isogenic line (NIL) with the Arroz Terra allele decreased germination, while overexpressing the functional GF14 in Hitome increased it. This means GF14 is the gene behind the trait. Analysis of many Japanese rice varieties revealed the functional GF14 allele was lost during breeding. A new NIL in the Hitome background with a 172-kb fragment from Arroz Terra including GF14 showed better germination at low temperatures without affecting other traits. The GF14 from Arroz is a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers studied how the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its genetic material. They focused on the 8-nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) at the end of the virus's negative DNA strand, which is created during the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA. They wanted to know if this TR forms a 5' or 3' flap on the DNA and if it's removed during the formation of covalently closed DNA. To answer this, they created a mutant HBV cell line with a specific mutation in the pregen RNA sequence, altering the 3' TR while keeping the 5 TR the same. They found that the 5 TR serves as the template for the positive DNA strand, forming a duplex with the negative strand, while the 3 TR forms a flap which is removed during coval closed DNA formation. They also found that a cellular enzyme called Mus81 plays a role in removing the 3 flap, alongside another enzyme F1. The study sheds light on how HBV replicates its genetic material, contributing to understanding the virus cycle.
Researchers studied the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in treating wastewater from a canned pineapple factory and found that the community of microorganisms plays a crucial role in their performance. The team developed a model, called microbe-micro interaction genome metabolic (mmEM), to understand how microorganisms interact and adapt to changing conditions. The model included three main groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). They found that as organic loading rates increased, the community shifted from SO-domin to METomin, leading to a decline in FC performance. The model accurately predicted microbial abundance at low and high loading rates. Simulations showed that SO growth was limited at high rates due to reduced sulfate-sulf cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, allowing them to dominate. The study highlights the importance of crossfeeding in shaping community response to high loading. The findings will inform strategies for implementing FC technology in real-world environments.
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in medicine, such as prioritizing promising molecules for drug discovery. In these applications, ML models predict properties of biological systems and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates for new hypotheses for experimental validation. However, when applied to new situations, these models can be overconfident and produce many false positives. One solution is to quantify the model's uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme annotation as a case study, simulating the process of identifying functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep model with a statistical tool called conform prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled predictions for a protein. Conform prediction gives statistical guarantees to the model and ensures the expected F will not exceed a user-specified level with high. Experiments show C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at F than existing methods and accurate for underrepresented in data. We expect C to be a tool for discovery where high yield in experiments is desired but budget is limited.

We propose an ML, C, which leverages the conform framework to achieve FDR functions, and developed a deep model Light as the base of C (Fig 1). When to situations, models without uncertainty are susceptible to overconf, misdirecting efforts to validation false. Addressing becomes essential ensure efficiency of ML-assisted. We presented C, an that enables F-controlled-assisted discoveries. Leveraging conform, allows users to specify their tolerance, to goals and makes with controlled. We demonstrate effectiveness using as a case, simulating the of functions less-character Machine models a role in generating hypotheses for analyses and facilitating discoveries various. A challenge in process-ass is development with quantification of predictions.
Researchers have found that a protein called HSP-90 plays a crucial role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease caused by mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for T-43 protein. T-43 is a protein that, when misfolded and phosphorylated, contributes to the disease. H-90, a heat shock protein, interacts with T-43 and stabilizes its normal form, but its role in neurotoxicity is unknown. In a C. elegans model of ALS, loss of H-90 function protects against T-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. This is accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated T-43 protein. H-90 also upregulates stress response genes, including H-70 and H-16.1, and normal levels of H-16.1 are required for H-90 effects on T-43. The neuroprotective effect of H-90 does not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. This study shows that H-90 chaperone activity contributes to outcomes in T- proteinopathies in a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the reproductive system of the Artemia franciscana, a type of crustacean, using a technique called single-nucle RNA sequencing. This allowed them to identify the different types of cells present in the ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and muscle cells. They compared their findings to a similar map of the reproductive system of the fruit fly, Drosophila, and found that many of the programs that control cell identity and function are conserved between the two species. This suggests that these programs have been in place for over 500 million years.

The researchers also looked at how genes are expressed in the germ cells during meiosis, the process of cell division that leads to egg production. They found unique dynamics in the way genes are regulated in Artemia compared to Dophila. This could be due to the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in Artemia, a phenomenon where the sex chromosomes are not visible during meiosis.

The study used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to understand the transcription and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis. This approach allowed them to identify distinct cell types in the Artemia ovary and compare them to the Doph ovary. The results suggest that many of the pathways that define cellular identity in the ovary are conserved between the two species.

The study highlights the use of single-nucle RNA sequencing as an alternative to traditional methods for studying meiotic sex regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate meiotic cells. It also shows the complexity of the reproductive system of Artemia and the need for more research in this area.
Chronic pain is a widespread and debilitating condition that costs the United States around $600 billion annually. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The mechanisms are unclear, but allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Researchers analyzed biophysically-motcircuit structures in laminae-II of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types of allody: static and dynamic. They used neural rate models to describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. A sensitivity analysis identified mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysregulation of subc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory responses. Which mechanism, subc components, and proportion of subuits vary depending on subc structure. Results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies.
A protein called eukary elongation factor 2 (EF2) is crucial for accurate translation of proteins in cells. It relies on a helper protein called Hsp90 and cochones to function properly. Researchers studied how H90 and cochones work together and found they have distinct roles in regulating EF2. Some yeast with mutations in H90 or cochones had lower levels of EF2, while others were more sensitive to a toxin that targets misfolded proteins. The study suggests H90 helps not only with protein folding but also with translation of new proteins. It also shows that yeast with H90 mutations have different effects related to subsets of cochones. This could lead to better understanding of how to target H90 with fewer side effects. EF is a key protein for ribosome movement. The study found a link between H90 mutations and cochones in EF, reopening, and H1. It suggests H90 role in translation by modulating EF folding. However, it also shows H90 has a role in elongation in addition to initiation. A protein called H1 bridges EF with cochones and H90 or TR. Further study is needed to understand this interaction. The study measured EF folding by levels and sensitivity to toxin. Results show H90 and cochones have distinct roles in EF function. Folding of EF is dependent on H1, C7, and C1 cochones and sensitive to H90 mutants. The goal is to understand how clients interact with H90 and cochones for selective inhibition of H90. Two forms of yeast H90 are 97% identical, while two forms of EF are 100% identical.
When making decisions in social situations, people usually combine their own preferences with information about the options at stake. However, it's unclear how these decisions are made when preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, such as in individuals with certain brain damage or cognitive impairments. Researchers studied participants with lesions in the insula or anterior cingulate cortex, key areas involved in decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made alone and after observing others' choices. Both groups showed disrupted use of standard calculations about risky options. For social decisions, they relied more on others' choices, independent of calculations. These findings suggest that in social situations, others' choices may be a shortcut for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted.

The study investigated how decisions in social contexts are made when utility-based risk is inaccessible, as in individuals with certain psychologies or novel options. A decision task was used to examine whether heuristics facilitate socially situated-making about risk when processing is disrupted. Previous work showed individual and others' information combined during decision-making under social influence. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions showed disrupted utility risk processing and used social information to guide decisions. These suggest conformity can serve as alternative to utility-based information in social decision-making when risk is impaired.

A relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of others' choices heuristic. Those most disrupted in utility-based decision conformed most with others' choices. This was replicated in an independent sample, providing evidence for a trade-off between utility and cognitively demanding heuristics in social decisions.
Researchers have used Richard Dawkins' biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. However, they found that biomorphs can also illustrate how developmental biases shape evolutionary outcomes. They discovered that biomorphs exhibit a type of bias called phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are much more likely to appear through random mutations than others. This bias favors simpler phenotypes with low complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, which can be understood as evolution searching the space of algorithms. Using population simulations, they showed that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biom's structure, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble molecular-phenotype maps. These patterns can be explained by a model of constrained and unconstrained genome sections. The researchers postulate that bias towards simplicity and other biom patterns may hold for developmental systems.
Researchers investigated whether humans can intuitively tune into the dynamics of nonlinear systems and excite their resonant motions. They used a virtual double pendulum with a haptic joystick, where participants had to hit two targets, either aligned with or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. The results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the pendulum's motion close to the N, even when targets were far from it. This suggests humans can control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, possibly by adjusting muscle stiffness to shape the system's dynamics. A tool was used to compute nonlinear modes (N) of energy-conservative systems, which are similar to linear systems' eigenmodes. The study extended existing research on human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems with data.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs) play a crucial role in developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of their influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. Researchers found that two TS regulators, Sco and Abr, along with the Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulcherrin in B. subtilis. Analysis showed that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pulerr biosynthesis gene yC was found to be controlled by Sco, Abr, and PR, and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced in each background. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems highlights the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology. Biochemical analysis showed regulators of the pul biosynthesis operon and transition regulators Sco and Abr bind the yC promoter with different affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in B. subtilis is tightly repressed during exponential growth by two regulatory systems. Transition regulators Sco and Abr have been studied for roles in diverse B. subtilis physiology, including sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm. Microarray analysis of effect of Sco on global expression was carried out in cells at different growth points in media. Further roles of PR and Abr in regulation were established using DNA assays and evidence that Sco can bind yC in vitro. Results establish a model where biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during transition to stationary phase and input from PR linking phase with extracellular sequestration.
After a spinal cord injury (SCI), patients may experience either detrusor-sphinct dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the injury. SD is characterized by the loss of coordinated control between the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and the urethral sphincter and pelvic muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced SD and inence. Researchers developed a mathematical model to replicate the neuronal dysfunction of the bladder after SCI and incorporated additional neurophysiological features to replicate improvements in bladder function with lumbar T of patients with SCI. A computational model of the neural circuit of mictition based on Hodgkin-Hux equations replicated normal bladder function, added interneurons and network to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI, and increased density and complexity of interactions of inhibitory and excitatory lumbar interneurons to provide diverse responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of interneurons after SCI. The model reproduced re-emergence of spinal voiding after SCI. Low-frequency TMS (1Hz) normalized control of voiding after SCI, while high-frequency T (30Hz) enhanced urine storage.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of a type of fungus called Aspergillus fumatus, which is a type of filamentous fungus. This model uses data that is easy to collect, called optical density (OD) measurements at a wavelength of 600nm, instead of collecting detailed measurements of the fungus's shape and size over time. The model accounts for the fact that OD is not a direct measure of growth, but rather a related to it. This makes it possible to estimate growth rates without needing new calibration data. The model was tested and shown to be better at fitting and predicting growth curves compared to other models that didn't account for the relationship between OD and true growth. It was also more accurate than models that didn't include calibration. The new model can be used in any lab that collects OD data, not just specialized ones with automated systems. This is a step forward in treating severe fungal infections, as current methods rely on collecting detailed data that is hard to get.
Beetles are the most diverse group of animals, with over 400,000 known species, and a wide range of sex chromosome types. Most beetles have XY sex chromosomes, but some have X0 sex determination. Researchers created a complete chromosome map of the beetle Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and used 11 other beetle genomes to study sex chromosome evolution across Coleoptera. They found that ancestral groups of genes are shared across beetles, while the X chromosome is maintained, but autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes. These neo-chromosomes evolve like sex chromosomes, with dosage compensation and non-random gene expression. Beetles provide a new model to understand sex evolution.

Beetles are a promising to study sex evolution and forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing study at the molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes form in closely related species. Analysis is needed to understand patterns and forces across species. Researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct sex and chromosome evolution in beet. A new chromosome assembly was created for Tribium confus and published assemblies from 11 species across the phylogeny (Fig 1). Parthenogenesis is found in 7% of species, with fusions between chromosomes and autosomes creating neo-chromosomes. Beetle chromosome types are inferred from testes, often XY, X0, and Xy. Chromosomal sex is conserved across beet but unclear if identity is conserved. Diptera have XY but genomic diversity in sex types, transitions and autos into sex. Abundance of beet and tools make Cole a model to study sex mechanisms and forces across taxa.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histone variant H2A Z plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, particularly in response to cellular stress. H2 Z is encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene and is predominantly incorporated into chromatin by the SWR-complex SW1. While H Z has been implicated in transcription regulation, mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, growth defects in mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW1 subunits, suggesting previous work may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW1 when missing H Z substrate. H mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, indicating a more substantial role in gene regulation may be uncovered under stress. To explore this, mRNA profiles were generated for wild-type, mutants, and before and after exposure to hydroxyurea, which induces replication stress. Data showed Z played a more prominent role in activation than repression during exposure and was important for upregulation of several induced genes. Apo-SW1 contributed to defects in mutants, particularly involved in phosphate homeostasis. Mapping Z incorporation before and after treatment revealed decreases at transcription sites correlated with, but not required, upregulation during exposure. This study characterized the effects of Z incorporation during transcriptional response.
Researchers have been using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data to advance our understanding of developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying individual cell lineages has become challenging due to the accumulation of large datasets and high dimensionality of data. To overcome this, automated methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training, but obtaining annotated single-cell data is difficult, so a partial learning framework is proposed. This assumes a set of candidate labels is given for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised. The study extends state-of-the-art multi-class methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, regression, and ensemble to partial learning, and incorporates label structure into methods, focusing on hierarchical labels in developmental processes. Simulated and real datasets show these enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly prototype-based method. Performance with partially annotated data reaches fully supervised. Uncertainty in partially annotated data is studied and prescriptive results on effect on accuracy. Findings show hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less annotated data than supervised methods.
Researchers have found that a molecule called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) plays a crucial role in the formation of structures within the cell's nucleus called speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets. These structures are important for gene expression. P2 is found in these areas and is involved in a process called RNA polymerase II transcription. Interestingly, the location of P2 is dependent on the presence of RNA. The researchers investigated if P2 and RNA work together to establish the nucleus's architecture. They used a technique called mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with P2 in human cells. They found that proteins with intrinsically disordered regions and basic P2-binding motifs are features of these proteins. These proteins also have sites for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. A protein called bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner through electrostatic interactions. Altered P2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BR4 protein. The study suggests P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation. This implies P's role in establishing a functional nucleus for gene expression.
Scientists have long believed that the ability of organisms to change their traits in response to their environment, known as phenotypic plasticity, plays a key role in their adaptation and diversification. However, the genetic mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. A group of insects called dung beetles, or Scarabinae, are known for their diverse development in response to nutrition, including the growth of horns, which are secondary sexual weapons that vary greatly within and between species. Researchers studied the genetic basis of these traits in three species of dung beetles, Onthagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella, and compared them to seven others in the same order Coleoptera. They found changes in coding and non-coding sequences associated with regulation of development and metamorphosis, and contrasted chromatin in developing horn tissues of high and low-nutrition males and females. The study highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in development and evolution of traits, and provides new reference genomes for three species for future studies.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how Lassa fever works, a deadly disease caused by the Lassa virus (LASV), for a long time. They wanted to know why some people get sick and some die from it. To study this, they used cynomolg monkeys, a type of monkey, and infected them with LASV to see what happens. They looked at how the virus behaves in the body and how the immune system reacts. They found that lymphoid organs, like lymph nodes and spleen, are where the virus starts to multiply. But how it spreads varies depending on how sick the person gets. In mild cases, virus stays in these organs and immune cells. In severe cases, it spreads to all organs and causes inflammation, leading to death. This study helps understand how LASV works and why some people get sick and some die.
Researchers have found that disruptions in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) play a key role in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia, and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's Related Dementia (AD/AD). However, it's unclear whether these disruptions are a primary cause or consequence of the disease, and what factors contribute to them are unknown. The study used two mouse models of neurodegeneration, NemR86 and NemRg, which mimic cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, and found an Import-Î²-specific nuclear block. They also observed cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, ImportÎ², Ran1, and Ran. These findings were supported by a pathological interaction between ImportÎ² and mutant NemR in cytoplasm accumulations. The study also identified transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease and showed that transient inhibition of ImportÎ² in mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in mouse models. The results suggest that mislocalized and dysregulated events in multiple neurogener diseases may arise from a primary defect in ImportÎ² nuclear import. This has implications for investigating sporadic forms of neurogeneration from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in ImportÎ² function.
Scientists have been studying bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, to understand how they work and how they can be used in medicine and biotechnology. To do this, they need to understand how bacteriophages infect bacteria. CRISPR-Cas, a tool that edits DNA, can be used to study this process. However, bacterophages can resist CRIS-C by modifying their DNA, making it hard to edit. Researchers used an enzyme, NgET, to temporarily remove these modifications, making it easier to edit bacterophage DNA. This allowed them to introduce precise changes to the bacterophage genome without leaving a scar. They tested this on a bacterophage that infects E. coli and found it worked. They also found that the modifications protect the bacterophage from being cut by CRIS-C, making it harder to infect. By removing these modifications, they could study how they affect the bacterophage's ability to infect. This approach can be used to study how bacterophages work and engineer them for biotechnology.
Scientists have discovered a crucial role for a protein called histone H2A Z in protecting cells from DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. When UV light hits DNA, it can create "lesions" that interfere with the cell's ability to read and copy its genetic code. To fix this, cells have a system called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER) that removes the damage. However, this process is not fully understood. Researchers used yeast cells to identify H2 Z as a key player in this process. Without H2, TCER is impaired and cells are more likely to break their DNA, leading to instability. This is a major threat to the cell's survival. The study highlights the importance of a "repair-friendly" environment around DNA to keep the genome stable.
Researchers studied gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two Drosoph melanogaster strains and their F hybrids from divergent populations. They found extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects, with genetic background effects on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were stronger than genetic-specific, but the gut was more similar to Malian tub than to each other. Examining allele expression, both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in expressed between populations than conserved genes, but trans effects were more tissue than cis. Despite variable architecture, this was robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during divergence. Transcript data from parental and F hybrid D melanogaster strains showed genetic and mode of variation highly tissue and background-specific. Gene expression was similar between Malian tub and midut, despite being part excret and digestive system, while gut was part alimentary canal. Overall, findings demonstrate functionally interconnected tissues can show divergent architecture among and backgrounds.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the start date of an emerging disease outbreak by analyzing early reported cases, rather than relying on genomic data. They applied this approach to the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China to be November 28, 2019, and the Alpha variant in the UK to be August 21, 2020. This method uses a population dynamics model to track the spread of the disease and can be applied to other outbreaks beyond COVID-19. The study validated the approach with simulated data and compared it to previous estimates based on genomic data, finding similar results. The method can also estimate the proportion of undetected cases. The researchers applied it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK and the first SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. The model was parameterized with data from the literature and ran 5,000 simulations, yielding a median of 52 days between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the first symptomatic COVID-19 case, with a range of 41-78 days.
Scientists have long understood how homologous chromosomes pair during meiosis to form haploid gametes from diploid cells, a crucial for sexual reproduction. However, the mechanisms ensuring homolog pairing in the presence of non-homous chromosomes remained unclear. Researchers developed an agent-based model of homolog pairing from chromosome dynamics, simulating unidirectional movements and close-range interactions. Chromosome number, size, velocity, and repulsive forces were key factors in kinetics and efficiency of homolog pairing. Dissociation between non-holog chromosomes contributed to pairing by crowding homolog into a limited area, creating conditions for close homolog attraction. The model accurately recapitulated efficiency and kinetics of hom pairing in wild-type and mutant yeast meiosis and can be adapted to other organisms.
Li-Fumi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, is caused by mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA miR-34, a target of p53, has a modifier role. In mice lacking miR-34 exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer, but promote tumorigenesis in cancer-prone backgrounds. mi-34 genes are conserved between zebraf and humans. Zebraf mi-34 and mi-34/c have similar timing, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage leads to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants are viable and have normal damage-induced apoptosis. However, mi-34- with gain-function tp53R217/217 or tp- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp mutants alone, confirming mi-34's tumor-suppressive function. Transcriptomics at 28 hours post-fertilization (h) characterized damage-induced, and 28 and 72h determined mi-34-regulated genes. At 72h, loss mi-34 enhances erythrocyte levels and upregulates my-positive hematopoietic stem. Overexpression mi-34 suppresses reporter, not p53 induction and sensitizes embryos to camothin but not Î³-irradiation.

In zraf, mi-34 and mi-34/c are p-dependent on p53 for induction under damage and partially on p for baseline. Residual mi-34 induction is due to other factors activated by damage. mi-34's tumor-suppressive function is shown by earlier onset in mi-34 and tp mutants compared tp mutants. Overexpression mi-34 sensitizes embryos to camothin but not Î³irradiation. Despite mi-34 not affecting p53 genes, its effects on tp mutant zraf were evaluated given epigen silencing M34 in humans with TP mutant alleles contributes cancer. tp- and tpR217/RH mutants were used as controls and mi-34- tp- and mi34 tpR217/RH compound mutants generated. Expression mi-34 is partially on p under conditions, and by damage is fully p-dependent. mi34 has small transcript effects 28h zraf under control and damage.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). In hermaphrodites, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in males OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL-1 is known to be critical for proper C. elegans male development, but its low expression was thought to be minimal in hermrodite development. Our study reveals OL- plays a role as a regulator of developmental timing in hermrodogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, we found hermrod embryos have accelerated cell division and developmentally advanced transcription when OL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows OL- regulates initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription in hermrod. We found OL- mutant embryos overexpress H3 methyltransferase MET-2 and altered H3me. Some effects of OL- loss were reversed by MET-2 loss. These findings show OL plays a developmental role in embryos of both sexes and MET as OL effector in hermrod.
Scientists are developing new ways to control mosquito populations using genetics, such as "gene drives" that can spread through a population. To monitor these projects, researchers need to detect when the gene spreads beyond its intended area and when mosquitoes develop resistance. This requires efficient mosquito traps that can detect the gene quickly, ideally before it's too late. Insecticides, like bed nets, can be compromised by resistant mosquitoes, so detection is also crucial. A new tool, MGSurv (Mosquito Gene Surveillance), optimizes trap placement to minimize time to detect a gene of interest. It considers mosquito biology and landscape, such as food and breeding sites, movement, and trap attractiveness. Examples show optimal placement for Aedes aegypt in Australia and Anopheles gambia on the island of SÃ£o TomÃ©. Murv is for field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. 

MGSurv was used to distribute traps to minimize time to detect an allele for Anopheles gambia on the island of SÃ£oÃ© Tom, Tom and Princ. The island is a candidate for gene drive trials due to a single malaria vector species. Setup, running, and output are explained, with examples for Aedes aegti in Australia and Anophe g on SÃ£o Tom. Future needs and applications for mosquito surveillance are discussed. Early detection is key for invasive species, minimizing impact, elimination, and surveillance cost-effectiveness. Murv optimizes trap placement for mosquito populations to minimize time to detect an allele. It considers biology and landscape, such as food, breeding, movement, and trap attractiveness. Examples are shown for Aedes aegti in Australia and Anophe g on SÃ£o.
Researchers studied the tiny microorganism Symbonas scillans, a 1.4 micrometer in size, which was previously thought to have endosymbiotic bacteria inside its cells. However, they found no evidence of these bacteria using amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from two strains of S. scillans. Fluorescent in situ hybridization also showed no bacterial presence. Instead, they found contigs in the data related to viruses infecting green algae. Using one of these viruses as a reference, they assembled a nearly complete 190 kilobase genome and found similar viruses in two other strains. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190 nanometer particle similar to the original endosymbion. They conclude S. scill does not have endosymb bacteria but is associated with viruses.
A family of proteins called leiomins (L) plays a crucial role in muscle function. Mutations in three members of this family (L1-3) cause human diseases. Mutations in the most common form, L2, lead to severe heart problems. Most disease-causing mutations in the L gene are nonsense or frameshift, which should result in short proteins. However, in most cases, little to no L protein is made. Researchers found that a cellular process called nonsense-mediated decay, which gets rid of mRNAs with early stops, is the reason for lack of protein in two L2 disease-causing mutations. They also made a treatment that blocks this process, allowing mutant protein to be made. This could lead to new ways to help people with L-linked muscle diseases. 

Mutations in L3, the most common in muscle, cause muscle weakness. Mutations in L2, most in the heart, cause severe heart problems. A patient with a mutation in L2 had no L protein in their heart and low levels of L2 mRNA. Researchers thought nonsense decay was the reason. Two more mutations in L2 also had no protein. They made a treatment that blocks decay, increasing mutant protein. Most L-linked diseases have same problem: thin filaments, weak muscles, and weakness. Most mutations are nonsense or frameshift, but little to no protein is made. A process called nonsense decay gets rid of mRNAs with early stops, which could make treatment less effective. Combining a treatment that blocks decay with one that makes full protein could help patients with certain L2 mutations.
Researchers studied how different versions of the apolipoprotein E (Apo) gene affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They found that one version, Apo4, increases the risk and another, Ap2, decreases it. To understand how this works, they looked at how proteins are made and broken down in the brain and liver of mice with human Apo genes. They found that Ap4 and Ap2 change how proteins are made and broken down in the brain, but not the liver. In the brain, Ap4 makes it harder for mitochondria to work properly and Ap2 makes them work better. Mitochondria are important for energy in cells. Ap4 also makes it harder for cells to get rid of old or damaged mitochondria. Ap2 helps cells get rid of old or damaged mitochondria. This study shows that looking at how proteins are made and broken down can help understand how diseases like Alzheimer's works. It also shows that Ap4 and Ap2 affect the brain more than other parts of the body.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CRISPR-TRM to knock out genes in specific cells of the fruit fly's nervous system, specifically in motor neurons, muscles, and glial cells. This tool, called CRISPRTRM, allows scientists to study the function of genes in these cells without affecting the rest of the body. The researchers used CRPRTRM to study the neuromuscular junction (NM), a connection between motor neurons and muscles, and found that a protein called SNARE is essential for its maintenance. They also discovered that a pathway called ESC suppresses NM growth by downregulating retrograde signaling. Furthermore, they found that motor neurons rely on ESC to release vesicles at the NM. This new tool, CRPRTRM, helps scientists understand how the NM works and what genes are important for its plasticity. The NM is a model for studying many biological processes like axon development, synapse formation, function, and locomotion.
In the fruit fly Drosophila, the development of blood cells in the lymph gland relies on a pool of progenitors that accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) during larval stages. ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FA) to facilitate differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Researchers found that the Dophila NF-Îº transcription factor Rel shields the progenitors from metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. ROS serves as a signal for progenitor differentiation, but is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. The study reveals how NFÎº-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways to regulate cell fate during development. 

In Dophila, Rel is present in the embryonic lymph gland, but its expression is restricted to larval progenitors. Overexpressing Rel in progenitors leads to downregulation of FA. Negative regulation of NF-Îº signaling on fatty oxidation has been reported in diseases. The progenitor population in the gland is intercepted from precocious differentiation. ROS in Doph blood cells elicit JNK to facilitate differentiation. The J-FA axis is essential for progenitor differentiation. The study shows Dila NFÎº factor Rel expresses in ROS-rich progenitors and decreases as they move towards differentiation. Loss of Rel leads to activation of JFA, coaxing differentiation. Rel expression downregulates TAK, losing inhibition. Absence restrains T1 results in sustained J activation, impinging FA and differentiation.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal brain development, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the RNUAT gene. Researchers studied a patient with ALS features but no mutations in RNUAT, instead found a variant in the RTTN gene. They analyzed the impact of the variant on RT protein function in cells and discovered cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy and cell death. In brain cells, they found RT plays a role in organizing neural stem cells into neural roset, leading to delayed roset formation and growth. These defects contribute to microcephaly.

The study used various models to understand the disease mechanisms of Tay-L syndrome. The RT variant alters splicing, confirmed by RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. They used patient fibroblasts, engineered cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells to analyze the impact of the variant. Results showed RT-mutated cells accumulated in G-M phase due to mitotic abnormalities, leading to anupidy and cell death. Mitotic defects were associated with misoriented mitotic spindles, favoring premature differentiation into neurons.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Escherichia coli adapts to survive long periods without food by entering a state called long-term stationary phase (LT). They let E coli grow on rich food, then stopped giving it new food for six years. They took DNA samples at 12 times to see how it changed. They found that E coli adapts by getting same mutations over and over time, up to six years. They also found that groups of E coli with same changes behave similarly across different groups. This means same changes happen independently in different groups. The study shows that E coli adapts by same way in many times, and that some changes are connected to past events. They found that many changes are connected and one third of them are linked to past events. The study shows that E coli adapts by same way and changes are connected to past.
Researchers have found that a specific RNA molecule in fruit flies, called MSA, which was previously thought not to be a coding RNA, actually produces a protein that plays a crucial role in how mated females use sperm after mating. This protein is different from another version of the same molecule, called iab-8, which is found in both males and females, but does not produce a protein. The team discovered that the reason i-8 does not produce protein is due to a mechanism in its genetic code that prevents it from being translated into a protein. They found that two specific parts of the i-8 code, called upstream reading frames, are responsible for this. In experiments, they inserted a marker into the i-8 code and found it was not present in the part of the fly where i- is normally found, but was present in another part. They also found that these upstream reading frames in i- prevent it from being translated into protein. This is important because i- is found in the nervous system and its loss leads to male and female sterility. A shorter version of i, called MSA, produces a protein that helps mated females use sperm and is found in a specific gland in males.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CD) are a group of rare, multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. However, because glycosylation is ubiquitous, symptoms can affect most organs. Loss-of-function mutations in glycos genes lead to CD. Current methods can only be applied to one disorder at a time. CD are likely connected because they affect glycos and show similar symptoms in patients, suggesting common modifiers may affect multiple CD. Researchers used evolutionary tools to analyze glycos genes and identify potential modifiers for all CD.

Evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) between N-linked glycos and GPI synthesis suggests unexplored connections between pathways. ERC occurs when proteins under similar constraints. High scores between GP1, a GPI transamase, and AL1, manosyltransferase in N-linked glycos (ERC=0.29). Seven glycos proteins in top-scoring pairs are associated with CD, suggesting known CD genes are candidates for modifiers. Top scores revealed ERC between PIG and U20 (ERC=0.33) and P and W36 (ERC=0.74).

Glycos is conserved from yeast to mammals, allowing strong signals to develop over time. Identified modifiers for CD have ERC, including PM2-PG1 (7.08) and DPT-D1 (4.17). In vivo testing top hits had a higher rate (10/16) than previous studies (5/16 and /34).
Researchers have discovered a crucial step in the life cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that helps it package its genetic material, called RNA, into new virus particles. This process is called encapsidation. A protein called HBc plays a key role in this process. It has two parts: an N-terminal domain for capsid assembly and C-terminal for RNA encapsation. Phosphorylation, or adding a phosphate group, to the C-terminal is essential for RNA encapsation. However, as the virus matures, this phosphate is removed, suggesting a phosphatase, an enzyme, is involved. Scientists used a special antibody to track the change from phosphorylated to dephosphorylated state during RNA packaging. They found that the phosphatase, PP1, is recruited by the virus's polymerase, an enzyme, to remove the phosphate from HB. This process is essential for completing RNA encapsation and is linked to late-stage virus particles called multivesicular bodies. The study reveals a dual role for the polymerase: bringing RNA to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging. The findings also suggest PP as a potential target for antiviral development.
Researchers studied the role of bacterial symbionts in helping marine organisms adapt to environmental changes caused by the closure of the Isthmus of Panama. They sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from the genera Codak and Cten, collected on either side of the Isth. The results showed that lucid species from the Caribbean had Candidatus Thiazropha symbts with genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbt phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of nifDK operon revealed that the common ancestor lacked n genes and populations in oligot habitats required the operon through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests HGT of n operon facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro enducida clade. Nitrogen availability drove ecological diversification of chemynthetic symbt species and highlights bacterial role in adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers studied the TAS2 family of protein-coupled receptors, which are responsible for detecting bitter taste in vertebrates. They found that frogs and salamanders have a large number of TAS2 genes, more than any other vertebrate lineage. Most vertebrates have TAS2 genes in clusters, but amphibians have more clusters and genes per cluster. The study also found that TASRs have one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but total TASR count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xeniotics. The study suggests that TASRs in amphibians may have acquired tissue-specific functions through gene subfunctionalization. The researchers also found that the number of expressed receptors not in the tongue is proportional to the number of TASRs in the genome. This implies that increases in TASR may have allowed for acquisition of tissue-specific functions.
Researchers studied how a protein complex made of NICD, RBP, and MAML binds to DNA to regulate Notch gene expression. They found that Notch-deficient mice are sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Transcript analysis of colon cells showed no evidence of Notch-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an elevated epithelial immune response, likely causing sensitivity. They used a human colon cell line to study Notch interaction and found an unbalanced interactome with reduced interaction with transcription machinery but preserved with HD2 interactome, suggesting cooperation. To test if HD2 contributes to Notch loss, they used a HD2 inhibitor and found it prevented intestinal consequences of Notch loss and gammaase inhibitors in mice, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation in stem cells. Notch dimerization in mammals is not about transcriptional regulation but overall proteome environment with consequences to immunity and hypersensitivity. HD3 interacts with NIC, regulating stability and activity. Notch expands stem niche at expense of goblet and entero cells.
Researchers studied how genetic diversity in populations is affected by "background selection", a type of natural selection that acts on harmful genetic mutations. They found that migration between populations can reduce the impact of background selection on genetic diversity, but didn't fully explain why. They developed a new theory to predict how migration affects background selection in a subpopulation and extended previous theory to an island model. Simulations showed this theory best predicts genetic diversity and differentiation between populations. They found background selection can increase genetic differentiation under high migration rates, but reduce genetic diversity, especially in large populations. This work extends background selection theory to structured populations and suggests it can confound locus-to-locus genetic scans.

Background selection acts on harmful mutations in two regimes: strong selection and low mutation, or weak selection and high mutation. Previous work focused on strong selection and low mutation. They found migration reduces background effects on genetic differentiation but not fully explained. New theory accounts for migration in island model, showing it breaks cross-gener association between neutral and harmful alleles. At high migration rates, harmful alleles leave populations before selection removes them. This weakens background effects on differentiation and reduces genetic diversity.

Theory predicts background in island model with finite demes and migration follows genetic drift. It extends genetic approach to account for migration's influence on background. Predictions support background weakly confounding locus-locus scans when flow is common. Simulations show this true in island when migration is strong. They discuss effects on genetic diversity and performance of predictions.
Researchers have found that large amounts of genetic and phenotypic data are necessary to understand the causes of diseases. However, sharing data among institutions is difficult due to methodological barriers and privacy concerns. To address this, they developed FedGAT, a federated genetic testing tool that uses a statistical approach to correct for confounding and polygenic effects without sharing data. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves the same results as pooled analysis while preserving privacy. Federated studies have challenges, such as collecting harmonized data and covariates, but can use meta-analyses with summary statistics to reduce burden and privacy concerns. Current research focuses on secure GWAS, but lacks correcting polygenic effects due to complexity. FedAT is flexible and integrates random effects in different designs without changes. It uses homomorphic encryption and encryption to protect statistics in the federated setting, increasing data sharing and protection.
Prostate cancer is a hereditary disease with ancestry-based incidence and mortality rates. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, their accuracy continues to improve, and research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness in African and Asian populations is key for equitable use. Recent algorithm developments for PRS derivation have improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. This study benchmarked the predictive power of six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts. Modest improvement in discriminatory ability was found compared to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. Our findings underscore the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts.

Advances in genetics have led to improved cross-ance PR disease prediction. However, these models have not been formally assessed in prostate cancer. Our analysis across biob-scale datasets benchmarked algorithms and found modest over traditional methods. These are based on prioritization, shrinkage, joint statistics, annotation, mapping, and population heritability estimates. This is the first study to assess panance polygenic prostate in the All Us cohort. We found hierarchical clustering stratified poly scores by ancestry.

PRS-strat prostate antigen screening may reduce overdiagnosis and over-treatment with screening. However, ancestry-associated incidence and outcome biases require scores work equally across populations to limit disparities. We evaluated published scores in the UKob cohort. No differences in cancer or risk factors were identified. Public polygenic scores were evaluated in the dataset. Briefly, models were trained on allelic scoring and first 10 components with cross-validation, regardless grouping. Predictive improved upon integration age and poly. Similar UKob, addition history and BMI did not increase power. We demonstrate utility from the UKob dataset that genetic with age is sufficient to predict cancer.
Researchers have identified a potential treatments for DPAG1CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation. They used a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed, small eye and performed a drug repurposing screen on 1,520 FDA-approved drugs, finding 42 that improved the model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine 2 receptor partially rescued the DP1 model, suggesting dopaminergic signaling is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine to N-glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1CD. The study also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine, CO inhibitors, and NK1, revealing novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and potential new options for DP1CD.

The Dophila model was created by knocking down DP1, resulting in a small, improperly developed eye with 10-50% protein activity. A repurposing in Doph for DP1CD could find new therapeutics. The study screened 1,520 molecules, identifying 42 that suppressed the DP1 model and confirmed many interactions. The findings were verified using pharmac and genetic manipulation, aligning with known mechanisms. New connections were established between DP1 and DA, NK1, and prostagland synthesis.

Multiple drugs improved the Doph model, with 8/21 (38%) validated in further analysis and 6/16 (38%) improved DP1. Most were genetically validated by manipulating their targets in Doph. The opposite effect of receptors compared to 2 suggested an opposite effect on eye size. Heterozygous mutations in 1 and 2 were crossed into DP1, supporting the hypothesis DP1 flies with 1 mutation had worse eyes than DP1 alone.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the sense of proprioception, which helps us control movement, for a long time. But they still don't know how the brain represents limb position in the somatosensory cortex, a part of the brain. A team developed a new model, called topoVA, to create a map of the brain from movement data. They tested it with monkey reaching movements and found two things: the shape and speed of hand movements are represented in a special way, even though the model didn't know about arm or hand positions. Also, the direction of neurons in the brain are organized in a specific way, like blobs and wheels. The model makes predictions that many neurons don't just represent one joint, but many. This model helps understand how the brain works and can be used for brain-computer interfaces and robot control. 

The brain needs to translate body movements into a representation that can be read by neurons. The model should learn this without being biased to one sense, so it can work with other senses too. Proprioceptive areas help us do complex movements, but we don't know how they work. The team made a model that predicts single neurons and how they're organized in the brain. They trained and tested it with human movement data and found it worked. The model can be used to understand how the brain works and help with brain-computer and robot control.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene, a hormone involved in plant growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the plant's perspective. However, few studies have examined its role in microbes. A study found that Azospirillum brasil, a beneficial bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospillum Eth Response 1 (AER1). ER1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity, and treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and root colonization. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters A. brasil's colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts to ethylene sensing. This provides potential targets to regulate beneficial-micro interactions.
Researchers studied the role of the IN80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. They found that IN80 localizes to the XY body in pachene spermatocytes, suggesting a role in meiotic sex. Deletion of IN80 led to high expression of sex-linked genes and active RNA polymerase II on sex chromosomes, indicating incomplete inactivation of sex genes. The study suggests IN80 facilitates recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex genes. This role is independent of common IN80 target H2A. Instead, IN80 reduces chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes. Data indicates IN80 in DNA factor localization, facilitating silencing sex genes during pachema.

 IN80 interacts and regulates sex gene silencing in pene spermatocytes, promoting chromatin opening during zyema-pachema transition at DSB regions. It regulates chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Accessibility is central to DNA repair and transcription. IN80 also silences autosomal genes in spermat by promoting H3me3 modification, while H4 remains unaffected. However, IN80 silencing sex genes meiotic is independent of direct transcriptional regulation by DNA factor recruitment.

The study shows IN80 unique role in silencing sex genes pach spermat. It regulates chromatin at DSB sex regions, independent of H2. IN80 interacts with factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment sex during pachema. IN80 also interacts with A and M in meiotic spermat Î³2 X at D sites zema remained intact in80KO. The proposes initial Î³2 X deposition at sex axis initiates IN80 recruitment MDC, amplifying Î³2 in IN80-dependent ATR
Scientists have discovered a key factor called SV-1 that helps axons in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans regrow after injury. SV-1 is a special because it can act like a growth factor to promote regeneration and a protease for development. To understand how it changes from one to the other, researchers looked at a gene called CDD-2. They found that C-2 helps convert SV-1 from a prote to growth factor for axon regeneration. This is important because SV-1 has a part that looks like plasmin, a protein that breaks down other proteins, but it also has a part that looks like growth factor, which helps cells grow. The team found that changing one amino acid in SV-1, from histidine to tyrosine, stops C-2 from working properly. They also found that a special structure in SV-1 mRNA is needed for axon regeneration. These results show that C-2 helps axon regeneration by changing SV-1's function from prote to growth.
Scientists have long used zebraf fish to study their physical and mental state, as a valuable tool to assess the impact of aging, disease, and the effect of drugs. The collective behavior of these fish can be represented by active models, where individuals are abstracted as self-propelling agents. The behavior of these agents depends on a set of parameters, similar to those of physical systems. In some cases, the system can be controlled at the level of individual, such as interactions between colloidal or enzymatic behavior. However, usually, collective behavior is influenced by environmental factors and cannot be changed. Researchers challenged this scenario by genetically modifying zraf. They demonstrated the potential of genetic modification in controlling collective behavior of biological systems at the level of constituents, rather than externally. Specifically, they probed the effect of the lack of col2 gene in zraf, causing early onset osteoarthritis. The col2-raf exhibited compromised vertebral properties, swam less, and took longer to change orientations. Surprisingly, a group of mutant fish exhibited more collective motion than wildtype. Researchers captured behavior of wild and col-raf with a simple matter model, modeling fish by self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates possibility of tuning biological system, changing state with simple matter.
Researchers have developed a computer model to simulate the growth of blood vessels in the lab, called capillary networks, which are crucial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical signals to understand how they form and function. The model shows that capillary networks develop when both mechanical and chemical cues work together, with cell movement and shape driven by soluble and bound forms of a protein called VEGF. Soluble VEG in the culture medium changes cell shape, while bound VEG on the surface provides signals, both important for network formation. The model agrees with experiments, showing cells forming cords and aggregates. However, some issues remain, like omitting bound VEG necessity and not fully reproducing tilted experiments. Another study showed capillary development through stress and strain between cells and substrate. This study explores how mechanical and chemical cues work together in network formation.
Researchers have studied the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFÎ²) family of proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a small worm, to understand their role in the immune response to bacterial pathogens. The TGF family consists of secreted proteins that play a role in cell, tissue, and organism homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. In C elegans, there are five TGF ligands, allowing researchers to study their interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. The T ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF/Activ subfamilies that signal through discrete pathways. The study found that all five TGF ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens and that multiple T ligand pairs act together in this response. Two BMP-like ligands, DB-1 and T-2, function independently, while T-2 and T-3, a T/Activ-like ligand, function together. Structural analysis suggests T-2 and-3 can form heteromers. T-2 and-3 lack a conserved cysteine for disulfide linking dimers. The study also found that DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transducers function in response to pathogens, but components of T/Activ pathway do not play a major role. These results show potential for BMP and T/Activ subfamilies to interact and provide a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses like the immune to pathogens.
Scientists have discovered a new role for a protein called Nat4 in protecting cells from DNA damage. Nat4 is an enzyme that adds a chemical group to histones, which are proteins that DNA wraps around. When DNA is damaged, Nat4 is turned on and goes to the damaged area. Without Nat, cells are more sensitive to damage and have more breaks in their DNA. The study found that Nat helps the cell's response to damage by adding a group to histone H4. This helps the cell fix the damage. Without Nat, the cell can't fix the damage as well. The study shows that Nat is a new player in the cell's defense against DNA damage.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells within a tumor, known as a phylogeny. This is useful for understanding how cancer develops and treating it. Current methods can't accurately reconstruct phylogenies with more than 30 mutations or sometimes fail. Orchard can reconstruct phylogen with up to 1000 mutations. It does this by approximating the distribution of possible phylogenies and optimizing each step by step. Evaluations show Orchard outperforms other methods in reconstructing phylogen in 90 cancers and 14 types of leukemia. It also accurately reconstructs phylogen with 1,000 mutations. Large phylogen can identify patterns of genetic variations among cancer subpopulations. Cancer studies generate large amounts of data with hundreds of mutations and samples. Until now, algorithms couldn't reliably reconstruct trees with more than 30 mutations. Orchard solves this by not needing to pre-cluster mutations. It accurately solves problems with 100 mutations and 100 samples. Benchmarking against other methods, Orchard matches or beats baselines on reconstruction with up to 300 mutations and 100 samples. It recovers larger trees on simulated data and reconstructs 100-node trees in 26 hours.
Researchers have developed a new tool called Immugen to predict how the body's immune system reacts to cancer cells. This is important for creating personalized medicines that target cancer cells directly. The problem is that the body's immune system doesn't always react as expected, making it hard to predict. Immugen is a computer model that uses language to predict how the immune system reacts to cancer cells. It's made of three parts: one that predicts how the immune system binds to cancer cells, one that uses information from the immune cells themselves, and one that predicts how likely the immune system will react. Immugen is better than other models at predicting how the immune system reacts to cancer. When it also uses information from the immune cells, it gets even better results. The researchers looked at how well Immugen works and found areas where other models are weak. They also found biases in the data used to train other models. Immugen is a way to predict how the immune system reacts to cancer and can be used to make better medicines.
Researchers have identified a gene called protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPPCC) as a key factor in determining the color of meat, specifically lightness and redness, in chickens. They used a genome-wide association study and whole-genome sequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to map the gene to a 6.24 kilobase region on chromosome 15. The study found that PPP was associated with meat color at a very low probability of 8.65E-08. Further analysis confirmed the relationship between PPP and lightness through Mendelian randomization at a probability of 2.9E-12. Experiments with mice lacking PPP in skeletal muscle showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in muscles, and a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch muscle fibers. Transcript and metabolome analysis revealed decreased expression of slow-twitch muscle genes and enhanced glycolysis. A specific variant in the PPP gene, rs520, was found to regulate its activity. Differences in meat color, myoglobin, and PPP expression were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. This study identified PPP as the causative gene for meat color and a target for innovation in meat technology.
Researchers have developed a new technique called superresolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the structure of retinal ganglion cells in the retina. These cells receive signals from bipolar cells, which form subunits within the ganglion's receptive field. By identifying these subunits, scientists can better understand the retina's architecture. To do this, they combined super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to create STR. Simulations showed it can find subunits across various models, and experiments on primate ganglion cells validated its feasibility. STR can reveal sub layouts in minutes, making it ideal for online investigations.

The technique, STR, combines stimulated emission microscopy and computed tomography, sharpens subunit responses and reconstructs them below their scale. It uses stripes at varying angles for tomographic reconstruction. Researchers tested it on a realistic gang cell model and electrophysiological recordings from primate ganglion cells. Rapid sub identification leaves time for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry. By knowing sub locations, stimuli can be made to characterize spatiemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic weights of each sub, and evaluate across sub within gang cell field.
Researchers have developed a new method called CRISPR-DR to identify genes that interact with antibiotics in bacteria. This method uses a technique called CRISPR (CRIS interference) that edits genes to see how they respond to drugs. The goal is to find genes whose abundance changes when a target protein is depleted, showing a synergistic effect with the drug. Different sgRNAs for a target can cause varying protein depletion and growth effects. The strength of sgRNA can be predicted, but actual growth depends on cell sensitivity to protein depletion. Essential genes can be measured by quantifying growth rate. Most efficient sgRNAs are not always best for detecting synergies with drugs. CRPRDR incorporates sgRNA and drug concentrations in a dose-response equation to capture interaction. It analyzes data from a study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify interacting genes with antibiotics. This method can be applied to non-CGI datasets, shown with a CRPR dataset for E. coli on different carbon sources. It performs well compared to other methods, but noisy datasets generate more interactions, likely false positives, CRPRDR maintains precision in empirical and simulated data.
Researchers have developed a new method to find communities in gene-expression networks without assuming they are organized in modules, or groups of genes that work together more with each other than with other groups. They used this method, called the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM), on data from fruit flies and found that it found 10 times more groups than other methods. Some of these groups were not modular, meaning they didn't work together more with each other, and were just as important as the modular groups. This shows that gene networks are more complex than thought and we should rethink the idea that modularity is the main way they are organized. The researchers also found that non-modular groups were widespread and just as important as modular ones, highlighting the need to look beyond modularity when studying networks. They suggest using methods that don't rely on modularity, like graphical lasso, to find patterns in networks. The SBM can be combined with network inference to use community structure to inform the network and vice versa.
Researchers studied the role of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) in yeast, a protein involved in post-transcription control, including translation, initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, they used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and RiboSeq to analyze yeast cells lacking the P1 gene. They found drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, and defects in translation initiation and termination in P1 cells. The defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in P cells appear to be partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, in addition to P1's direct role. Cells without P1 showed a nonsense readthrough phenotype, indicating a defect in termination. The results indicate that P1's loss is pleiotropic and disruptive to post-transcription regulation.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that can cause slow brain rhythms, such as those seen during sleep or seizures, in neurons. These rhythms are different from the normal firing of brain cells and are thought to be caused by how cells interact with each other and how long it takes for signals to travel between them. However, a new study suggests that a common feature of brain cells, the sodium-potassium pump, can also play a key role. The pump helps regulate the amount of potassium outside the cell, which can affect how the cell fires. The researchers created a simple model to show how this works and found that it can cause slow rhythms. They also found that the strength of the pump can make the cell fire in bursts or be silent. This could be important for understanding and treating conditions like epilepsy, where brain rhythms are abnormal. The study suggests that problems with the pump, such as from lack of oxygen, can cause changes in brain rhythms. The model shows how the pump can cause slow rhythms in all types of cells, not just specific ones. This is a new understanding of how brain cells work and could lead to new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new software package called COPS to evaluate and compare different methods of clustering, or grouping, cancer patients based on multiple types of data, such as genetic and molecular information. Current methods often focus on one type of data, like genetic or molecular, and don't consider how stable the groups are or how well they predict patient outcomes. COPS can handle multiple types of data and assess stability and predictability. It was tested on seven types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and lung, using different types of data. Unlike previous studies, COPS compared data-driven and knowledge-driven methods and used cross-validation to ensure robust results. Clustering was evaluated using standard metrics like survival analysis and stability. However, results varied across methods and datasets, so it's essential to use multiple criteria to select the best approach for disease discovery. COPS used Pareto concept to balance metrics in each case study. Four methods, Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Factor, Multiple Kernel-Mans, and Pathway Induced Kernels, were most stable and effective in grouping patients with different survival outcomes. The study aims to demonstrate COPS effectiveness in multi-clustering and provide insights for cancer subtyping and personalized treatment. Unlike previous studies, survival analysis was based on predictive value beyond clinical information. Findings have implications for patient stratification and treatment.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC protein SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic development and specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. Researchers have identified a novel loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain. Analysis of mutant animals harboring this mutation revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonizes LET-381, the C elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. SEM-2 also regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the lineage. The study suggests an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. The research adds to the understanding of the regulatory network underlying C elegans postembry development and the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.
